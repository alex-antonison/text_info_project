- Alex Idea
  - Job Site Web Scraping
  - Problem to be solved
    - There is no great resource for people to go and see what skills are currently in demand by companies.
    - When I was job hunting, I was manually scraping jobs by going to LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor and noting the skills I see in a google sheet.
    - We could automate this by building a job site web scraper that could be put into two parts
      - Part 1 - Scrape the data and store in a data store (thinking NoSQL)
      - Part 2 - Analyze the scraped data for top skills, skills that multiple companies are looking for, etc
      - Part 3 - Over time analysis - run the scraper over time, collect the job postings, and see if there is a general trend that can be observed in.  A Hypothesis is that job postings would reflect what tech blogs are focused on which used to be computer vision and is now NLP.

- Language
  - All agreed that Python would be a good choice for both learning and ease of use.

- Topics for next 3 to 4 days?
  - Look over [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)
  - Tag up at 2:00 PM on Sunday to discuss.
