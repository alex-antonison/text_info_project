# 2019-09-30 Meeting

- Initial thoughts
  - I have put together a Google Sheet of a handful of blogs that have scraped jobs from Indeed.com.  With this much already having been done, not sure if it will be novel enough. (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XhU56eX7k0Bn-Iagx0_AQ2JcfkoGe83CR_N4iKb4-Mc/edit?usp=sharing)
  - After reading the specific terms of service, I am now thinking this is not the best idea.

- Other Ideas
  - Identify influential people in a twitter network based on how many people follow them / retweet / respond / like
  
- Sai  
    - Construction / Mining industry
    - Few tools in industry
    - OCEA (safety and health)
    - Any fatalities, has to be recorded
        - Single one stop site
        - Analyze data from past -> find recurring theme

We both agreed this sounds like a good project and plan.  Sai will be working on writing an initial summary that we can then work on to flesh out more into our one page proposal.

Discussed using trello as a means of coordinating project work.

- Action Items
    - Sai will write out the initial summary for the project
    - Alex will spin up a trello board
