# Setup

1. The first step in setting up this project will involve installing a version of python 3.  This can be done either through [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).
2. Install the necessary packages using the `requirements.txt` file with the following code:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It is suggested but not necessary to use a form of environment management such as [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
