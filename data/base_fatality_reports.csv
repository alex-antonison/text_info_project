jarrett to prepare to lift the no  shovel using four bottle jacksat  am rivers begay jarrett and thygerson prepared the pump system and began the process of raising the bottle jacks into position the pumping system applied pressure to the bottle jacks however the bottle jacks did not move the gauges on the pressure side of the pump read between  and  psi and hydraulic oil leaked out of the relief valves on the no  and no  bottle jacks see appendix a  accident diagram the contractors shut down the pump and determined that the pumps return valves were closed the contractors opened the return valves and restarted the pump oil stopped leaking out of the relief valves on the no  and no  bottle jacks and the bottle jack rams began to raise the valves were turned off to hold the bottle jacks in place once the two bottle jacks touched the bottom of the shovel no  and  jacks did not raisea loose fitting on the return line was found on the no  bottle jack the fitting was tightened and the no  bottle jack ram raised up when the pump was turned on once the ram contacted the bottom of the shovel the valves for the no  bottle jack were closed to hold the bottle jack in positionthe no  bottle jack still was not working the pump was shut off and begay and rivers inspected the no  bottle jack for leaks but found none begay and rivers were in the immediate vicinity of the no  bottle jack when the pump was restarted jarrett stated that the bottle jack ram did not rise and the pump gauge read approximately  psi after approximately two to three seconds the relief valve ejected out of the no

dispatched south central district enforcement employees lee cruise mine safety and health inspector and robert seelke supervisory mine safety and health inspector to the mine site to secure the scene upon arrival msha issued an order under provisions of section k of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners and began the investigationmshas accident investigation team with the assistance of fred t marshall msha technical support mechanical engineer conducted a physical examination of the accident scene interviewed mine employees and contractors and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management miners and contractor employees see appendix b for persons participating in the investigationthe accident occurred at the shovel rebuild area in the valencia pit the contractors were preparing to rebuild the crawler tracks and install power stairs to access the shovel the rebuild project started on march   komatsu performed the major portions of the rebuildthe contractors positioned the bottle jacks under the shovel on march   and determined the pump used to pressure the bottle jack system did not work a replacement pump was brought to the site the following morningon the day of the accident rivers begay jarrett and thygerson prepared to lift the shovel using the bottle jack system rivers and begay were standing near the bottle jacks while thygerson and jarrett were at the pump when the accident occurred begay estimated that rivers was approximately three feet from the no  bottle jack and in direct line with the relief valve when it was ejected from the bottle jackexponent an independent laboratory tested the bottle jack system fred t marshall msha technical support mechanical engineer was present during the testing exponent determined that the damage patterns on the failed pressure relief valve show that physical damage to the valve had occurred prior to the accident and not as a result of the accident the lack of any threads remaining on the valve body the surface damage to the entire length and circumference of the unthreaded portion of the valve body the lack of threads in the first portion of the cylinder port and contact marks on the underside of the hex head all show that the pressure relief valve sustained an impact force which drove it into the port until portions of the hex head contacted the cylinder body aligning the contact marks on the underside of the pressure relief valves hex head with machining marks on the cylinder body shows the relative orientation of the face of the pressure relief valve prior to ejection from the cylinder port as a result of the physical damage the relief valve had only an interference fit like a cork to hold it in the cylinder port instead of the integrity of a threaded connection when the work crew turned on the pump to raise the bottle jack the pressure caused the damaged relief valve to eject out of the portweatherthe weather at the time of the accident was clear with a west wind of  mph and a temperature of  degrees fahrenheit investigators did not consider the weather to be a factor in the accidentequipment involved in the accidentthe bottle jack involved in the accident was an enerpac rrseries model rr a doubleacting cylinder with a nominal stroke of  inches and a rated lift capacity of  tons the bottle jacks were hydraulically powered by an electrically operated hydraulic power unit catalog number su model a serial number  in both directions ie to extend and retract the bottle jacks or to both raise and lower the bottle jack respectively product information supplied by one of the contractors representatives shows that the hydraulic power unit had an adjustable hydraulic output pressure setting of  to  psi and that the twoway bottle jacks maximum operating pressure was  psithere is a pressure relief valve inserted directly into the retract side of the cylinder on the bottle jack using a threaded connection the relief valve has a relief setting of    psi and when this is exceeded the relief valve vents hydraulic fluid to the atmosphere because the jack is double acting the relief valve can vent hydraulic fluid to the atmosphere when the jack is not under load with a supply pressure as low as    psithe operator generally raises the bottle jack by depressing a threeposition switch on a hand control pendant a hydraulic valve electrically controlled by the pendant then directs pump pressure and flow to the base side bottom side of the bottle jacks piston to extend the cylinder rod the upward movement of the piston forces the hydraulic oil on the rod side top side of the piston out of the top of the bottle jack when raising the bottle jack a larger amount of oil is going into the bottle jack than that coming out of the bottle jack the operator releases the pendant switch to stop raising the bottle jack to lower the bottle jack the operator depresses the threeposition switch in the opposite direction the bottle jack lowers by directing hydraulic pressure and flow in the opposite direction of that for raising it in addition the speed of the bottle jack can be slowed by using manually controlled needle valves to restrict flow to or from the bottle jackthe bottle jack and pump assembly included an electrically driven twostage hydraulic pump with a preset safety relief valve the pressure relief valve in the retract side of the bottle jack was the component that mechanically failed and was ejected from a threaded port of the bottle jack

and  see appendix a he walked through the inby set of doors and closed them behind him following the power cable for the lights surveillance video shows that after ditterline activated the outby set of pneumatic airlock doors at  am the indicator lights for the doors began flashing which means the doors went into fault condition there were no witnesses to what followed but evidence indicated that ditterline walked up to the doors opened the slide access door and the airlock doors opened suddenly hitting him and pinning him between one of the doors and the concrete barrier when the doors opened holland hettercheidt wright and wilson could hear and feel the air velocity increase at the damaged stoppingpayne was working nearby and walked through the boot wash area to the shaft bottom once at

ditterline and transported him to hamilton memorial hospitaljames steven bowling hamilton county coroner pronounced ditterline dead at  am dr james jacoby forensic pathologist performed an autopsy and stated that ditterlines death was due to a cardiomyopathy coroner bowling listed cardiomyopathy as the cause of death on the state of illinois certificate of death worksheet the worksheet also states that the manner of death was naturalwhen a miners death is not conclusively determined to be chargeable to the mining industry msha submits the case including facts and supporting information to the msha chargeability review committee review committee for a decision the review committee has been in existence since  and has reviewed over  cases the review committee is currently comprised of the following personsafter a thorough review of the facts and medical information the review committee found that acute stress cardiomyopathy can occur when an individual is exposed to sudden intense physical or emotional grief fear stress which causes rapid and severe heart muscle weakness acute stress cardiomyopathy can mimic a myocardial infarction a heart attack even in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease because  mr ditterline was seen on video moments before the door accident in no apparent distress  the door slam was a significantly traumatic event and  the death occurred at the time of the door slam the review committee members concluded it is probable that the trauma of the accident triggered acute stress cardiomyopathy therefore the review committee stated mr ditterlines death should be charged to the mining industry

crosscut  of the no  conveyor belt entry to replace the bad conveyor belt splice belt stopped the conveyor belt switch by using a belt switch located at crosscut  and positioned the splice at approximately  feet away from the center of crosscut  grubbs and belt worked together to secure the conveyor belt clamps on both ends of the splice once the conveyor belt clamps were secured grubbs and belt used two chain ratchets in conjunction with the conveyor belt clamps to pull slack in the conveyor belt they then removed the splice by cutting between the clamps belt planned to install new

company policy when a driver uses the service brake at a speed over five miles per hour the truck is secured in place until mechanics check to make sure the service brakes have not been damaged the haul truck was traveling over five miles per hour when the driver had to apply the service brakes so the driver could not move the truck until a mechanic could examine the brakes as a result the dispatcher suspended traffic on the section ramp and larry dowd shifter went to the area to manage the scene when dowd arrived he found the haul truck partially blocked the road he set up road blocks using mobile equipment  one roadblock just above the spunout truck and one near the intersection just below the spunout truck dowd also helped the dispatcher reroute traffic and clear the pit in preparation for the blast scheduled for  pm while he continued to monitor the haul truckcoty munson haul truck operator  was operating haul truck  hauling rock from the pit up to the cell  leach pad

said a white van is coming through your area please let them through kuhn drove around the spunout haul truck and then passed through the roadblock at the intersection of the ramp and the ramp audio

radio contact when approaching or passing large surface mining equipment kuhn parked the van facing roughly south on the right side of the haul truck while the van was parked the group inside was

dispatcher know the road was reopened and at  pm the dispatcher alerted miners that haul truck  was cleared from the road and ramp was open munson looked at the screen on the radio to verify the call had come from the dispatcher and since he had received permission earlier to take his load to the cell  leach pad munson decided to start moving the truck he said he looked in his mirrors and did not see the van earlier he saw a white van pass by him but did not hear anything over the radio about any other equipment near his truck munson honked his horn twice put the truck into forward gear

the center of each board pin boards in a single column under the cutter head of the continuous mining machinethorpe and maynard began performing maintenance on the left side of the continuous mining machine after changing cutting bits on the cutter head checking water pressure and water sprays on the left side of the continuous mining machine thorpe and maynard traveled to the right side of the continuous mining machine at approximately  am to assist stevens with changing a load locking valve on the cutter head jack located on the left side operators side of the machine stevens noticed the cutter head was still slowly falling after he changed the load locking valve on the right side of the head jack the previous nightthorpe leaned in from the operators side of the continuous mining machine between the raised cutter head boom and the pan and removed the load locking valve a sketch of the accident scene is shown in appendix b thorpe then waited beside the continuous mining machine while stevens retrieved a new load locking valve with the replacement valve in hand thorpe leaned back underneath the cutter head boom into the pan of the continuous mining machine at approximately

both miners stated there was a loud popping noise and then the cutter head boom dropped onto the victim crushing him between the pan and cutter head boom of the continuous mining machinestevens tried to pull thorpe out from under the cutter head boom but was unable to retrieve him stevens then started the continuous mining machine and tried to lift the cutter head boom off of the pan with the remote box but was unsuccessful because the hydraulic fluid needed to raise the cutter head boom was exiting through the port where the load locking valve was to be installed stevens then sent maynard to get help maynard went to kyle smith no unit lead man and told him of the accident smith was operating a batterypowered scoop in no entry at the time smith took the batterypowered scoop to the continuous mining machine and attempted to lift the cutter head boom in order to free the victim the batterypowered scoop could not lift the cutter head boom because it was too heavy smith then went

gas on the methane monitor for the right side continuous mining machine koger then went to the right side roof bolting machine located in the no  entry inby survey station no  to test the methane sensors on the roof bolting machine the roof bolting machines at this mine are equipped with a methane monitor that has dual sensors one sensor is located underneath each operators drill canopy according to koger both the right side continuous mining machine and the right side roof bolting machine functioned properly when calibration gas was applied to the methane monitor sensors after he completed the checks on the roof bolting machine koger started to walk away one of the roof bolting machine operators called for him to come back koger was told that the roof bolting machine would not start koger started troubleshooting the roof bolting machine koger stated that he took the cover off the largest explosion proof enclosure see appendix a on the roof bolting machine in order to troubleshoot the electrical circuits koger found a blown fuse and a broken resistor wire he determined that the blown fuse and broken resistor wire did not correct the startup problem at no time did

Virginia|Coal|Patriot Coal Corporation|Coal (Bituminous)|2014-05-12T20:30:00-04:00|WestVirginia|West Virginia|on monday may   at the start of the evening shift a safety meeting was conducted with miners on the no  section during the safety meeting an accident that occurred on the section on the previous friday may   was discussed with the section crew and described as a rib roll because of this accident additional safety precautions were suggested and passed on to the crew by bobby moore section foreman the additional safety measures suggested by mine management consisted of setting rib timbers on the right side of the entry and for the continuous mining machine operator to position himself away from the machine as far as possible the accident investigation interviews revealed that several members of the crew stated they had voiced concerns during the safety meeting the miners believed that the suggested rib timbers were inadequate for the adverse rib conditions encountered previously rib timbers are typically used as a means of roof support for wide areas and are not an accepted prudent engineering practice to provide protection from rib rollsthe evening shift section crew arrived on the no  section at approximately  pm and started retreat mining operations in the no  entry the previous crew had completed setting rib timbers along the right side of the entries in the nos   and  entries the preshift examination report for the section indicated that no hazards were observed in these entries after completing retreat mining in the no  entry the mobile roof support mrs units were moved by hensley and the continuous mining machine was moved by legg to no  entry to begin retreat mining the first left lift and the first right lift were mined successfully at approximately  pm while mining the second left lift from the pillar between the nos  and  entries a large violent and sudden pillar burst bump occurred causing fatal injuries to legg and hensleythe primary cause of the pillar burst was a highly stressed coal pillar located between nos  and  entries legg and hensley would likely have had their backs toward this pillar while they were engaged in mining the second left lift the original entry height in the no  entry was estimated to be approximately  inches and approximately  feet in width after the burst this entry was filled with loose coal to within  inches of the mine roof and the estimated entry height had been reduced to  inches due to convergence of the mine roof and mine floorduring the accident investigation interviews miners and personnel at the mine referred to the pillar burst as a bump according to the interviews the pillar burst also caused a large amount of dust to be suspended in the mine air making visibility very difficult for several minutes after the event as a result of the burst the pillar located between nos  and  entries contained a large gap between the coal and the mine roof of an undetermined width and depth the immediate mine roof in this area consisted of sandstone that contained only minor cracks and the roof strata in the area remained intact after the pillar burst no roof fall was associated with this eventprior to the accident mike shull section electrician was standing approximately  feet outby the continuous mining machine near the mrs units in the last open cross cut of the no  entry he observed legg and hensley working at the continuous mining machine and was supposed to help them move the continuous mining machine cable when a shuttle car being driven by bazzil goodman approached the area as the shuttle car approached shull stepped back into the crosscut to get out of the way at that time the pillar burst occurred shull stated that the force of the burst was so strong that shulls chest was hurt and he was nearly knocked down the only thing that prevented shull from being knocked down was that he grabbed the mrs cables hanging near where he was standing shull was the closest miner to the accident scene and was the first person to respond shull stated that the entire entry was immediately filled with dust and he could not see for several minutes when the dust initially cleared shull still could not see the continuous mining machine because the entry was filled with coal shull started yelling for legg and hensley but received no response shull used his handheld radio to call for help and assistance stating that they had two guys covered up and that they needed helpgoodman and todd agosti shuttle car operators arrived at the accident scene shull told goodman to go and find bobby moore section foreman for assistance and guidance shull and agosti tried again to look up the no  entry as the dust cleared they could see the lights on the top of the mrs units shull noticed that the continuous mining machines cable had been forced over top of the machines conveyor boomat the time of the accident moore and jackie bailey roof bolting machine operator were standing near the backup curtains in the no  entry when the pillar burst occurred they reported hearing the burst feeling the vibration from it and noticed dust filling the air immediately after the pillar burst moore and bailey started running toward the location of the continuous mining machine in the no  entry moore and bailey encountered goodman goodman and moore discussed the accident briefly while bailey proceeded on to the accident scene goodman and moore followed shortly thereafterbailey stated that when he arrived at the accident scene the area experienced a second bump which again caused dust to be suspended into the air surrounding the accident scene the second bump as described in interviews caused the uninjured miners near the accident location to move outby in the no  entrymoore arrived near the accident scene in the no  entry and proceeded to the section mine phone and called outside for joey athey operations manager for assistance shortly after this second event shull bailey agosti goodman and moore returned to the accident scene and discovered that they had verbal communications with hensley moore went back to the mine phone and called outside to inform athey that they had communications with one of the miners involved in the accidentmoore returned to the accident scene and had the two outby mrs units moved to the edge of the crosscut nearest the no  entry in order to provide additional roof support to the affected area of the accident moore took the section battery scoop and started removing the ejected coal from the no  entry to provide additional clearance for access to the trapped minersjeremy buskirk outby laborer and an experienced first responder with a local volunteer fire department was working near the no  section buskirk learned of the accident and went to the no  section where he spoke to shull at the section mine phone buskirk proceeded to the accident scene where he observed the area behind the continuous mining machine was filled with coal moore was still removing the loose ejected coal and debris with the battery scoop buskirk could hear someone calling for help near the continuous mining machine buskirk stopped moore from using the battery scoop to remove any additional loose coal buskirk feared they could cause additional injuries to the victims because they did not know their exact location when moore stopped the battery scoop they could hear hensley shouting for help againmoore agosti buskirk bailey and goodman crawled over the ejected coal to the back of the continuous mining machine they crawled single file with moore leading due to the restricted room to maneuver in the entry they found legg and hensley laying near the machine with hensley under the conveyor boom and legg at the cable standoff near the back of the machine moore proceeded to legg who was further inby and pulled him away from the cable standoff legg was found to be unresponsive and no pulse was detectedmoore then turned to help hensley who was shouting for them to get him out moore agosti buskirk bailey and goodman started to uncover and dig out the material around hensley using their hands and trying to pull him free moore realized there was still electrical power on the continuous mining machine and hensley was pinned from just below his chest by the machines conveyor boom moore retrieved the continuous mining machines remote control unit which was with legg and connected it to goodmans battery light in order to get power for the unit moore used the remote control unit to move the continuous mining machines conveyor boom off of hensley by raising the conveyor boom vertically according to the interviews shortly after the conveyor boom was removed hensley became unresponsive and attempts to revive him were unsuccessfulthe area near the accident location began to bump again forcing moore agosti buskirk bailey and goodman to leave the immediate area a decision was made to bring additional timbers and cribbing to the accident site to aid in recovery of the victims the removal of the loose coal from the entry with the battery scoop was resumed because the location of both victims had been determined timbers were installed in the last open crosscut the loose coal was removed in the no  entry up to the continuous mining machine and the entry was supported with wooden cribs installed near the center line of the entrythe following mine officials had also arrived on the no  section mark white chief electrician jamie lester evening shift mine foreman willard bourne

mine at  pm and traveled to the section the miners were under the direction of doug corbin section foreman the crew was responsible for moving and advancing the conveyor belt the feeder and tailpiece and the auxiliary exhaust fan the tailpiece and feeder were located between the no  and no  crosscuts and were to be advanced to just outby the no  crosscut a distance of approximately  feet the crew arrived on the section at approximately  pm corbin examined the faces and travelled the belt from the tailpiece to the power center where the crew was gathered corbin then made various work assignmentsanthony glover and william demoss roof bolter operators were assigned to install roof bolts and apply rock dust in the no  entry dylan simmons scoop operator was assigned to supply the roofbolting machine and assist with the belt move randy murphy scoop operator kenneth friend jonathan zinn aaron friend bobby morgan and rodney rosier general inside laborers and lambka were assigned to move the belt conveyorrosier friend and lambka walked from the section power center to the belt entry murphy transported two skids of belt structure to the no  crosscut backdragged the entry in preparation for the belt move and then attached the tailpiece to the batterypowered scoop although not a supervisor rosier acted as a crew leader and coordinated the belt move corbin periodically checked on the progress throughout the shift rosier started the belt and located a splice where the belt could be separated he then contacted perry mccure assistant afternoon shift foreman by radio and requested power to be removed and the belt to be locked out rosier friend and lambka began preparing for the belt move by removing the area lights the carbon monoxide monitoring system the waterline the existing belt structure and moving and reanchoring shuttle car trailing cables they backed the feeder inby off the tailpiece and removed the tailpiece anchors they trammed the feeder to the inby side of the no  crosscut and rehung the feeder cable zinn and friend began constructing a stopping between the belt and return entries at no  blocka roll of conveyor belt approximately  feet long was hung above the mine floor to remove the belt structure from a spool and the belt was placed along the rib at  foot intervals the tailpiece was loaded into the scoop bucket and moved outby no  block rosier friend and lambka installed eleven sets of belt structure between the previous feeder location and the tailpiece they removed the conveyor belt from its spool and spliced it into the existing belt rosier determined three additional sets of belt structure needed to be installed between the tailpiece and the last set of installed structure the feeder was backed onto the tailpiece

to work in the yellow rose drift a detailed postaccident map of the monogahela drift is provided in appendix ein the revenue lunchroom cappanno stated he was going into the monogahela drift to look at the blast area geist accompanied him into the drift because rick williams taught them to never travel alone management did not instruct either miner to enter the monogahela drift and it was not a part of their assigned tasks the two miners rode a locomotive to the last chute located  feet into the drift and walked toward the face of the dead end drift as they walked geist suspected bad air he lit his cigarette lighter to check for oxygen deficiency because they did not have a gas detector with them using a cigarette lighter is not an acceptable method to check for oxygen deficiency when geist observed the flame he told cappanno they needed to retreat from the drift they took a few steps toward the locomotive when cappanno felt ill and passed out he was approximately  feet from the face geist was able to stir cappanno and they walked another  feet when cappanno again passed out geist also felt the effects of the carbon monoxide and fell to one knee geist told cappanno he was going to leave and get helpwhen geist reached the locomotive he fell again but managed to climb into the locomotive and exit the driftjenkins and miller saw geist exit the monogahela drift and head toward the revenue lunchroomas geist entered the lunchroom he stated cappanno collapsed about  feet from the face in the monogahela drift and needed help geist warned the others to be careful because there is  dead end is an entry or mine passage extending beyond the mine workings into solid orean underground passageway either blocked or not mined throughbad air in the drift geist also told them to turn on some air valves referring to the air valves on the compressed air line in the driftat  am jenkins mangus c lee miner kyle e schoenebaum miner and leonardo torres nipper left the revenue lunchroom to find cappanno the locomotive they were using derailed at the blue lagoon torres remained at the locomotive and tried to get it back on track while the others ran toward the face as the miners advanced they stopped to open compressed air valves along the way however they did not realize the main airline was shut off near the entrance to the monogahela drift while trying to rerail the locomotive torres felt dizzy and walked out of the driftat  am miller called the surface from the revenue lunchroom and spoke to ryan dglover mechanic to inform him of the accidentglover told miller to bring geist out of the mine after millers call geist also called the surface from the lunchroom and spoke to mark ccoleman shift surface foreman and told him that people are down with cuts and bleeding in bad air and they need help miners in the yellow rose drift overheard the calls for help and michael a mcfarland miner christopher c scott miner i arthur m ficco miner and zachary d ficco mucker headed

found cappanno he was unconscious gasping for air and had facial injuries the miners tried to carry him out could not so began dragging him instead lee began feeling light headed and retreated jenkins and schoenebaum continued to drag cappanno after dragging cappanno approximately  feet jenkins and schoenebaum felt dizzy and stumbled they left cappanno near a compressed air discharge valve and retreated jenkins and schoenebaum caught up with lee and assisted him in retreatingat  am glover who was on the surface and originally notified of the accident notified rick williams at that time rick

temporary roof support atrs could not prevent it from hitting fitzpatrick the edge of the rock closest to fitzpatrick struck and pinned him in a semiupright position against the roof bolting machine drill mastat approximately  pm allport was operating the left side of the roof bolting machine when he heard the rock fall and turned around to find fitzpatrick pinned by a rock up against the drill mast allport rushed over and attempted to push the rock off of fitzpatrick allport was unable to move the rock due to its weight allport then attempted to move the roof bolting machine he lowered the atrs causing it to lose contact with the mine roof at that point allport decided that moving the roof bolting machine may cause more harm to fitzpatrick so he stopped and ran shouting for helprobert deboard the right side continuous mining machine operator was in the face area of the number  entry when he heard allport yelling for help deboard rushed to the scene of the accident and found fitzpatrick lying on the mine floor on his left side with the rock over him the right side roof bolting machine drill mast was over fitzpatrick but not touching himallport and deboard tried to lift the rock off of fitzpatrick but were not able to do so at this time fitzpatrick was losing consciousness and was unable to respond verbally deboard used a long slate bar to lift the rock off of fitzpatrick as the rock was lifted deboard realized fitzpatrick was not trapped by the rock but was only under it partiallyjames raines right side shuttle car operator arrived and helped deboard pull fitzpatrick out from beneath the rock fitzpatrick was given first aid treatment william smith section foreman traveled across the section yelling for help and then called outside to notify the dispatcher of the accident after the call outside was made he returned to the scene of the accident the dispatcher jimmy higginbotham received smiths call at approximately  pm and he immediately

clutter and scott shay general inside laborers to transport supplies from sugar run to miracle run clutter and shay entered the mine at the miracle run portal shortly after  pm they each took a locomotive motor and travelled from miracle run to sugar run shay operated the no b motor lead and clutter was operating the no  motor tail they were delayed at no  block near the sugar run portal bottom due to water over the track upon arrival at sugar run clutter and shay spoke with tim shaffer shift foreman sugar run shaffer told them to transport a trip of supplies needed for the metz portal to miracle run and bring back empty supply cars the metz motor crews would then take these supplies from miracle run to the metz portal shaffer instructed clutter and shay to evaluate the weight of the contents of the supply cars and determine if it was possible to transport everything in one trip clutter and shay decided the supplies needed taken in two trips of four carsthe slope crew dropped the first four cars down the tail track clutter and shay retrieved the four cars on sugar run bottom before leaving they spoke with shaffer again to decide where to place the empty supply cars when they returned shaffer instructed them to place the empty supply cars in the crossover entry clutter and shay coupled the first trip and proceeded to miracle run where they transferred the supplies to the metz supply motor crew there were no issues encountered on the first trip they then picked up six empty supply cars to take back to sugar run upon returning to sugar run they put the empty cars in the crossover and waited for the slope supply crew to drop the cars for their second trip the slope crew dropped the other cars into the mine clutter and shay discussed where to place the cars on the miracle run side it was decided to place the cars from the second trip in the pound spur at miracle run they believed the pound track spur was more level than the loaded track and clutter was concerned the trip could get away from them due to its weight and placing the trip in the spur with one motor clutter and shay hooked onto the supplies and proceeded towards miracle runthe no b motor was the lead motor heading toward miracle run the trip was composed of four longwall shield carriers the carrier behind the no b motor contained a longwall tailgate drive motor the next carrier contained a longwall shearer drum and ranging arm the third carrier contained longwall hydraulic hoses and the last carrier contained electrical cables and reels the no  motor completed the trip just before reaching the miracle run bottom the cars behind the no b motor derailed between the no  and  blocks clutter and shay evaluated the derailment and decided to put the cars back on the track one at a time beginning with the end of the first car adjacent to the no b motor see appendix i they decided to use cribbing materials and airbags clutter and shay began by separating the cars to make room for the airbag working on the wire side of the track the air hose was extended and the airbag was placed under the coupler with the intention of lifting the car straight up they placed the air bag on the mine floor and placed cribbing between the airbag and the coupler when the car was lifted with the airbag the trucks wheels were turned and the flange of the wheels would not clear the top of the rail a slate bar was used to straighten the wheels to align them with the rail and force the flange over the rail shay stated that when clutter barred the wheel the car suddenly shifted approximately  to  inches toward the wireside with tremendous force when the car shifted it contacted the slate bar causing it to strike clutter on the right side of his face and forehead shay asked clutter if he was okay and received no response shay checked clutter and saw that he was seriously injured and called jack saurborn dispatcher for help saurborn radioed for anyone in the area to

short indicated in the examination record book that the hoist was in safe operating condition the hoist was also examined by william lusk certified electrician on the day of the accident as part of the weekly examinations required for electrical equipment again no hazards associated with the hoist were noted in the record book for the weekly electrical examinationssteve colo iii construction foreman held a brief meeting with edward finney scoop operator brian southern and chris donaldson both outby utility men prior to the men entering the mine on the evening shift on february   colo informed the crew of their job duties for the upcoming shift he instructed the crew to pick up trash along the old intake entries on the west side of the service hoist using the outby batterypowered scoop and a metal bucket insert the scoop bucket insert once filled with trash was to be placed on the ton service hoist and sent to the surface to be unloaded according to colos instructions this cycle was to be repeated until all of the trash was removed from the designated area of the minethe mines communication and tracking system indicated that finney southern and donaldson arrived underground at the bottom of the service shaft at  pm to begin their work the outby scoop they were to use was normally located on the east side of the service hoist but it had to be moved across the hoist platform to the west side by opening both the east and west side gates once on the west side of the hoist the scoop and men would then travel through a set of air lock doors and enter the intake air course where they were to pick up trashonce in the intake air course the crew picked up trash and placed it in the scoop bucket insert where it was then taken to the service hoist and sent out of the mine southern stated in interviews that three or four loads of trash had been taken from the intake entries to the hoist prior to the time the accident occurreda review of the mines electronic tracking system report shows that the scoop arrived at the bottom of the service shaft along with finney southern and donaldson at  pm the tracking system also shows that three previous trips to the service hoist had been made by the crew prior to that timefinney was operating the scoop and was moving the machine forward bucket first toward the service hoist to unload a bucket insert full of trash as he approached the hoist he positioned the scoop bucket on top of the hoist deck so that he could push the insert out of the scoops bucket and onto the hoist donaldson and southern were standing on each side of the scoop observing the operation donaldson who was standing on the left side of the scoop and facing towards the hoist stated that as the insert was being pushed out of the

starting to elevate up the shaft picking the bucket end of the scoop off of the mine floorsouthern standing on the operators side of the scoop observed that the warning lights were flashing after donaldson had yelled and warned everyone to run southern immediately yelled for finney to get out of the scoop its starting up southern stated that the front end of the scoop was already approximately four feet off of the mine floor when he started running to get clear of the scoop when southern was behind the scoop and out of danger he turned to see if finney had exited the scoop he stated that finney appeared to be falling head first to the mine floor about the same time the scoop bucket slipped off the hoist deck and fell to the ground which created a lot of dust making it difficult to see clearly southern immediately ran to check finneys condition and found him to be unresponsive as he was located underneath the operators deck of the scoop glenn paugh maintenance foreman was working at

shift began prior to  am with roy gibson plant foreman performing a preshift examination first of the press building and then of the preparation plant building no hazardous conditions were observed nor recorded for this examination with his shift starting at  am jeffrey ted smith day shift press operator met with tom hull night shift press operator about the operation of the two filter presses during the previous shift hull indicated to smith that the bpress had an intermittent issue with stopping during its pressing cycle hull told smith that bpress stopped while pressing up and began its feed cycle prematurely hull resolved the issue by manually pausing and then restarting the bpress in order for it to complete the cycle hull mentioned no inconsistencies with the operation of the apress during his shiftas a normal part of his shift smith began to operate the presses via the human machine interface hmi computer which controls the presses by a control screen in the press building control room which is connected to the programmable logic controller plc system in the motor control center mcc room the operation continued without incident until approximately  am when slurry began to spray heavily out of the top of bpress during its feed cycle slurry sprayed from the bpress with sufficient force to tear insulation from the ceiling of the press building smith who was working on dropping cakes removing dewatered or compressed refuse material from between press plates as the press opens out of the apress paused the machine and went quickly to the control room to pause the bpress a large amount of slurry had sprayed from the machine covering smith also after pausing the bpress smith returned to complete the dropping of cakes from the apressupon completion of the drop cycle on the apress the slurry feed pump unexpectedly started while the press was still in an open position which was not the normal operating sequence slurry began to spray into the apress while the membrane plates were not pressed together this event caused smith to quickly pause the apress and report the malfunction to david kimbrell plant superintendent via a company radiosmith returned to the control room with both presses still paused while waiting for kimbrell smith noticed the control screen indicated that the bpress was in the pressing cycle smith knew this was incorrect as slurry was feeding into the machine when the blowout occurredwhen kimbrell arrived at the press control room smith told him he had lost control of both presses and he expressed frustration regarding the press problems smith left kimbrell at the control room and joined travis shamblin plant technician to help wash down the walls and cleanup the slurry spill upon hearing about the spill on the company radio bobby phalen property manager phoned dwight given maintenance manager informed him of the press problems and requested his assistance phalen traveled to the press building to assist with the cleanup and gibson arrived to help kimbrell and phalen smith returned to the press control room and expressed his frustration to gibson over the loss of control of the presses smith told gibson that he needed a break and gibson concurred smith got his lunch box and went to the employee change trailer to change clothes kimbrell phalen shamblin and gibson went to the mine office to take a lunch breakfollowing the lunch break gibson went to the change trailer to check on smith who had not returned from lunch smith visibly upset and covered in slurry confronted gibson once more about the loss of control of the two presses and slurry blowouts that had been occurring gibson asked smith if he would like to go home smith left the property just before  pmupon returning to the press building gibson asked shamblin if he would operate the presses since smith had left the property shamblin agreed and went with kimbrell and phalen to restart the bpress gibson temporarily left the press building and traveled to the plant to address other unrelated issues with the plant decanter when the bpress was restarted it once again sprayed slurry the bpress was opened and a torn filter cloth on one of the plates was found and replaced the bpress was then restarted only to find another leak gibson returned from the plant and began to help diagnose the problem with the bpress spraying water to wash off the individual plates of the machine as shamblin and phalen spread the plates apart in the area of the leakwhile cleanup work continued on the bpress given arrived to assist in troubleshooting the problems that were occurring with the two presses given suggested it might be helpful to reset the power to the plcs for both presses since the plcs control the automation and sequencing of the filter press system given reset the power to the plcs by opening and closing the related circuit breakers resetting power did not resolve the problems given went to the plant office and attempted to call hulin cook jr senior manager of power and automation noah toney electrical control specialist and brandon townsend specialist of electrical processes given was unable to contact any of the three men and instead left voice mail messages for them at approximately  pm informing them of the press problemskimbrell called joe white preparation plant engineer who was at the nearby kanawha eagle preparation plant and described the press problems to him white left kanawha eagle preparation plant to assist kimbrell while traveling to the press building white called cook who was in kentucky and asked him to call given cook called given and discussed the press problems meanwhile townsend received givens voice message and returned his call letting him know that he was also on his way to the sitegiven was able to make contact with toney who was at another location toney began to monitor the plc program remotely in order to assist in the troubleshooting of the presses kimbrell troubleshooting from the press building control room relayed messages to given via company radio who then relayed them to toney over the telephone white arrived on property at approximately  pm traveled to the press building and assisted gibson and phalen in troubleshooting the bpress another attempt was made to operate the bpress and again another slurry leak was found white went to the plant office to discuss the issues with given concerning the bpress white told given they thought the problem with the bpress involved torn filter clothwhite and kimbrell decided to checkout the apress while the filter cloth was being changed on the bpress townsend arrived on site at approximately  pm and traveled to the press building townsend met with white kimbrell and phalen and they briefly discussed the problem they were experiencing with the apress namely that the feed cycle started out of sequence townsend traveled to the mcc room and setup his laptop computerphalen returned to the mine office and told given that townsend was on site given proceeded to the press building and met townsend given and townsend entered the press building together and went up to the second floor kimbrell also met given and townsend at the top of the stairs and told them they needed to get the apress back to the beginning of the cycle kimbrell anticipated a potential slurry leak and asked given to sit at the control room computer in order to pause the machine should something go wrong the apress was manually closed and then switched to the automatic mode so that it could complete its normal cycle the apress continued its automatic cycle feeding the slurry compressing the material and then began to open as normal in order to drop out the cakes without incident white traveled down the offside walkway toward the feed end of the apress townsend followed kimbrell down the opposite walkway from the control room toward the feed end of the apress as it began to openwith white on the offside walkway and kimbrell and townsend on the control room side walkway the men began dislodging the caked material from between each plate using boat paddles to dislodge the cakes slowly working their way back toward the cylinder end of the apress observing it as it opened this cycle was completed without incident and the next cycle began automatically as the hydraulic pump started and the hydraulic cylinders began to extend closing the apress kimbrell and townsend continued toward the control room kimbrell turned right and stepped into the control room doorway to watch the control screen with giventownsend turned left into the walkway between the apress and the bpress stopping behind the hydraulic cylinders of the apress see appendix c in order to examine the hydraulic pressure gauge mounted on top of the upper cylinder about at eye level of the apress at approximately  pm while townsend was standing in the walkway between the two presses examining the pressure gauge there was a sudden and catastrophic failure of both hydraulic cylindersin an instant the broken cylinder barrels weighing over  pounds each shot into the walkway crashing into the end guarding and thrusting it against townsend driving him back approximately  feet into adjacent guarding and piping on the bpress he was caught between the two sections of displaced guarding and pinned against the adjacent press by the hydraulic cylinder barrels where he sustained multiple traumatic injuries which led to his death simultaneously white was struck in the face the blow left white lying on the walkway with serious injuries including a broken jaw and missing teethkimbrell was standing in the control room doorway and was sprayed from behind with hydraulic oil as he heard the sudden failure of the press kimbrell turned around and rushed to the aid of townsend as kimbrell was attending to townsend he noticed movement on the opposite side of the presses and observed white standing up with a laceration on his chin kimbrell asked white if he was alright and white acknowledged him white injured stunned and unaware of townsends location traveled downstairs and outside to the mine office to assess his injuries kimbrell was unable to fully reach townsend for assessment due to the position of the damaged guarding so he asked shamblin who arrived from working on the bpress to hold townsend upright while he went around the machine shamblin held onto townsends shoulder holding him upright while kimbrell ran around the machine phalen immediately went to call for help kimbrell switched places with shamblin and was unable to get a response or pulse from townsend gibson arrived from working on the bpress and was also unable to get a pulse from townsend townsend was suspended in a precarious position as he was pinned by the cylinder barrel and guarding beyond the walkway suspended approximately   feet above the concrete floormalden fire department was notified at  pm and arrived on scene at  pm upon arrival the firemen quickly assessed townsend and found that he had no pulse and was unresponsive the county medical examiner arrived at  pm and recorded his time of death to be  pm malden fire department carefully extricated townsend utilizing an overhead crane in the press building to move damaged components upon extrication townsend was transported by the kanawha

conducting a preshift inspection of the nolan run slurry impoundment msha impoundment site id no wv he inspected the main embankment and western saddle dike prior to the other miners starting work friedline did not note anything out of the ordinary at that time the shift started with a safety meeting in the preparation plant prior to the miners going to their assigned work areaskoon was operating a caterpillar dt lowgroundpressure model bulldozer dozer working on the main embankment of the impoundment afterward he moved the dozer to the western saddle dike to continue grading the upstream slope daniel krivosky and mark wentz were operating pans used to transport the ccr from the refuse bin to the impoundment for placement danny stonebreaker and craig carpenter were operating smoothdrum vibratory compactors and joshua dean was operating various pieces of mobile equipment later in the shift stonebreaker used another dozer to start building up a berm along the downstream edge of the saddle dike carpenter left the site to get the water panjeff cox impoundment inspector contracted through forquers contracting arrived at the site at  am to complete a required sevenday impoundment inspection cox recorded a pressure of  pounds per square inch psi on the p pneumatic piezometer located below the western saddle dike since the reading was greater than the hydrostatic pressure acting alone on the instrument it indicated that excess pore water pressures had developed cox had been instructed to notify consol personnel if the piezometer reading showed excess pore pressure this was the second consecutive weekly reading of the piezometer that indicated the pore water pressure was greater than the hydrostatic pressure hydrostatic pressure is the pore water pressure that is due to the difference in elevation between the pool and point of measurement p stuart carter project engineer for consol energy was immediately notified of the reading and he traveled to the sitefriedline met carter on the saddle dike at approximately noon they parked their trucks near piezometer p after discussing the piezometer reading they walked to the edge of the upstream slope on the saddle dike near the water surface carter noticed islands of fcr which had formed above the water surface in the pool south of their location friedline told carter that the islands were not present during his preshift inspection prior to  am during carter and friedlines inspection approximately  feet out into the pool the water started bubbling at the pool surface carter informed friedline that the saddle dike was starting to settle and everyone needed to get off of it suddenly a large crack formed across the saddle dike behind piezometer p and the pickup trucks as water sprayed into the air from the crack miners operating equipment nearby felt a sudden jolt from the saddle dike area koon radioed what was that the dozer koon was operating was located on the front slope of the dam with the front of the dozer pointed up toward the working surface koon attempted to maneuver the vehicle out of the pool as it slid with the failed material into the pool area the dozer eventually submerged with koon still in the cab stonebreaker drove his dozer off the saddle dike onto natural ground krivosky had just left the saddle dike in his pan and saw the events occurring in the pans mirror dean witnessed the dam failure from an articulated haul truck near the emergency spillway on the main embankment and immediately called for help over the radio both dean and krivosky returned to the saddle dike area as quickly as possiblefriedline and carter looked up and saw a to foothigh nearly vertical slope of ccr in front of them and realized the section of the embankment where they were standing was sinking rapidly the failure sent a wave of water to the other side of the impoundment friedline and carter were not able to reach the remaining portion of the dike before being engulfed by water friedline swam and waded to the southern corner of the remaining dike as it continued to break off dean krivosky and stonebreaker were able to pull him to safety carter fell down as the water rushed around him the momentum of the failed material and the current of the water carried him away from shore he grabbed a wooden crib block to help him stay afloat large slabs of the ccr embankment continued to fall into the pool carter floated past his partially submerged pickup truck from which he obtained a lifejacket however the momentum of the failure pushed carter farther toward the center of the impoundment where he was able to climb onto material that had heaved above the water surface level he was rescued by a boat operated by the winfield district volunteer fire department

roadway to prepare to move a spare power center to crosscut  benson and walker also arrived to assist in the hookup and initial movement of the power center into the roadway this power center is a large longwall component measuring approximately  feet in length  feet in width   feet in height and weighing approximately  tons after hooking gilberts forklift company number  to the power center with a single large pull chain walker backed out of the way gilbert pulled the power center into the roadway and jordan moved his forklift company number  behind the power center to assist in the

walker then proceeded up the hill to crosscut at approximately  am gilberts machine began pulling the power center to the final location being assisted by jordans machine as gilbert reached crosscut  he turned left toward the  entry this presented a problem because the designated location was near the crest of a hill and a stepup in the mine floor approximately  inches in height was present at the

the machine with the hydraulic steering were unsuccessful gilbert attempted to move his machine toward the power center to produce slack in order to unhook the chain benson walked up the hill and into the crosscut beside the operators compartment of gilberts forklift walker approached on the outby side of the power center and attempted to unhook the pull chain to allow gilbert to straighten his machine and get a better pull on the power center after attempts by walker to unhook the chain were unsuccessful walker proceeded back toward the roadway out of sight of all other personnel at this location benson gilbert and jordan stated they could see the light from walkers cap lamp though not the actual beam which indicated to them that walker was on the outby side of the power centerjordan

the left side of the roadway was approximately  inches from the coal ribbenson instructed gilbert to set his machine over this is a commonly used maneuver conducted by lifting the front wheels off the ground by lowering the forks of the machine and then using the hydraulic steering jacks to straighten the machine unknown to the other members of the move walker had positioned himself between the power center and the coal rib as gilbert performed this maneuver he was able to straighten his machine in line with the power center while straightening the forklift the power center shifted on the forks of jordans machine causing it to slide toward the left coal rib jordan looking toward the back of his machine felt the machine shake as a result of the power center moving on his forks at approximately  am he looked back toward the power center and recognized that it had shifted on his forks and was shocked to see walker pinned against the coal rib with the corner of the power center against his chest jordan immediately yelled we got julius and steered his machine to the left moving the power center away from the coal rib jordan was the first to get to walkers location immediately

inner machine cable into the junction box and moore then spliced the trailing cable to the cable reel after returning to the west main left section shaw installed the cable reel drive chain while moore and ennis were on their lunch break moore wired the cable reel after lunch with ennis observing at this time the leads in the junction box were spliced temporarily the shuttle car cable reel was now ready to be tested for correct electrical rotationennis walked to the section coal feeder the power source for the shuttle car removed the lock and tag left in place by the day shift electrician and energized shuttle car no  shaw got into the shuttle car operators compartment turned the pump motor on and raised the conveyor boom to check electrical rotation of the shuttle cars pump motor the electrical rotation was determined to be correct and the cable reel was determined to be spinning in the correct direction at this time moore was standing next to the cable reel compartment and ennis was walking toward the shuttle car approximately  feet away shaw exited the shuttle car operators compartment and asked ennis what tools he would need to complete the job ennis responded and then asked shaw to knock deenergize the onboard breakers on the shuttle car shaw deenergized the onboard circuit breakers on the shuttle car informed ennis that he had done so and went to his maintenance vehicle to get the tools ennis then climbed into the shuttle cars cable reel compartment and began cutting electrical tape off of one of the energized  volt cable leads ennis did not deenergize the shuttle cars power at the section feeder and did not install his lock and tag to assure power was locked outmoore who was standing next to the shuttle car spoke to ennis and noticed ennis was nonresponsive moore looked inside the cable reel compartment and saw ennis knife in contact with the cable lead at this time approximately  pm moore ran to the section feeder and deenergized all shuttle car circuit breakers meanwhile shaw had returned to the shuttle car and found ennis unresponsive shaw checked ennis for a pulse and found none moore returned passed the shuttle car in the direction of the section dinner hole and yelled for help dave bailey maintenance foreman and john bevins section foreman went to the shuttle car to give assistance bevins went back to the section dinner hole and called paul moore control operator informing him of the accident and also told him to call for a life saver helicoptershaw and bailey removed ennis from the cable reel compartment and

manifold separated striking him in the head the accident occurred at approximately  pm while saunders and fellow coworker david green were transporting a shuttle car along the track haulageway green operated the lead diesel locomotive with saunders operating the tail diesel locomotive a freedom shuttle car was positioned on a railmounted lowboy hauler connected to the rear of the lead locomotive and to the front of the tail locomotive forming a haulage trip greg addington first class mine foreman was riding in the passenger seat of the tail locomotive and had been assigned to supervise these miners during the shiftthe day shift had brought the lowboy and shuttle car haulage trip from the page portal and parked it at the  left side track off the  north mains allowing the shift change mantrip traffic to clear green saunders and addington met at the haulage trip lowboy and made preparations to continue transporting the shuttle car via the haulage trip to the st right panel off  east mains the miners drove the haulage trip approximately  feet along the  north mains and the  east mains track arriving at crosscut as the haulage trip proceeded through crosscut  intersection the shuttle car struck the tip of the manifold dislodging a component of the  inch valve from the valve body the electrical panel board of the shuttle car protruded  inches from the left track rail because of insufficient clearance for safe transport through the area when the water valve was dislodged water was sprayed into the air wetting saunders and addingtongreen and saunders drove the haulage trip through this area and stopped the trip just inby the broken water outlet green traveled on foot approximately five crosscuts inby to crosscut  where he closed a cutoff valve in the inch water supply line to stop the flow of water saunders exited his locomotive and traveled on foot outby to crosscut  where he also closed a cutoff valve to stop the flow of water in the inch water line saunders then traveled on foot back to crosscut  where he turned the cutoff lever of the inch crossover pipe toward the off position he believed he was stopping the flow of water from the inch water line located in the adjacent  entry see appendix a according to interview statements addington was wet and traveled on foot into the right crosscut between the  and  entries in crosscut  to stay out of the air currentgreen and saunders met at the cutoff valve located at crosscut  during the interview process green stated he observed saunders cutting off the crosscut  valve green stated he observed saunders reach down push it over and tap it with his hammer to where it should have been closed after the crosscut  crossover valve was turned by saunders green and saunders traveled outby to the crosscut  to investigate the broken water outlet and repair it both green and saunders examined the water outlet and found that the first quarter turn ball valve which was connected to the  inch nipple on the supply line had separated into two pieces the separation occurred when the brass tailpiece of the ball valve was pulled out of the brass valve body the tailpiece is provided with male fine threads and is threaded into the female finethreaded body of the ball valve the tailpiece remained on the  inch diameter nipple of the sixinch supply pipe the tailpiece of the valve is attached to the supply nipple by a coarse threaded connection see appendix b the water expelled from the dislodged outlet formed a pool of water combined with mine dust and gravel covering the nipple green and saunders used their hands to clean the loose mine dust and gravel from around the nipple to prepare for reconnection but never visually observed the nipple or the tailpiece of the valve the pool of water remained around the nipple due to a slight steady flow of water being expelled from the nipple according to witness statements the miners believed the water was residual water in the line and did not realize they had a supply line valve that was not fully closed because of the pooling water they were unable to gain a clear view of the nipple and valve tailpiece they attempted to evaluate the condition of the threads by touching them with their hands they visually evaluated the threads within the body portion of the ball valve for damage the miners believed the threads on both components were still in usable conditiongreen and saunders began by disconnecting the inch victaulic water pipe connection from the manifold to enable them to turn the manifold onto the tailpiece and nipple the two miners turned the manifold and ball valve onto the tailpiece and nipple to rethread the two components back together according to witness statements they turned the manifold multiple times by hand before saunders tightened the manifold with a pipe wrench during this process water continued to flow through the nipple into the manifold and out through the open outlets water was allowed to flow through to reduce pressure on the manifold as they turned the manifold onto the tailpiece and nipple according to witness statements addington did not participate nor provide any supervision or guidance to the miners related to the repair of the damaged fire valveafter installing the manifold green stood and turned away from saunders to speak with another miner standing behind him billy davis utility person helped saunders complete the connection of the inch victaulic line leading to the rock dust distribution machine located in the adjacent crosscut prior to making the victaulic connection the previously separated ball valve was placed in the closed position to stop the flow of waterwith the  inch ball valve closed pressure began to build in the sixinch line due to a partially closed valve still allowing water to flow in the line as the pressure increased the threaded connection between the valve tailpiece and the valve body failed at the location of the repair this caused the manifold to again separate from the nipple and valve tailpiece striking joe saunders in the face and head the manifold then traveled through the air and landed  feet and  inches from its original location saunders suffered serious lacerations to his face and forehead and lost consciousness at the time of impact emergency responders evaluated saunders vital signs confirmed he had a pulse was breathing and then took action to control bleeding greg smith assistant shift foreman and billy davis placed saunders on a backboard and transported him to the contrary portal hoist via a rail mounted mantrip addington stated in interviews that during this time he was in communication with the surface to ensure that proper medical arrangements had been made and communicating with personnel in the mine to ensure the track way was clear for transportation of the injured miner emergency evacuation plans were being made on the surface but due to adverse weather conditions air transport was not an option upon arrival on the surface saunders was transported by ambulance to nearby clinch valley medical center in richlands virginia saunders was later transported to the bristol

parked in the redwine pit a short distance from the accident scenethe redwine pit had been mined around a point to a position that placed the active pit under overhead high voltage power lines due to the power lines being in close proximity to the active working pit blasting practices were modified to prevent fly rock from damaging the power lines witness statements indicated that thirty  foot vertical holes were drilled but only approximately half of the drill hole was loaded with explosives this modified blasting practice resulted in the lower  feet of the highwall being fractured while the top  feet was left almost intact the fractured lower portion of the highwall was exposed as the shot material was removed on the second shift of december   an unstable highwall condition was created through this process and the weak fractures in the lower  feet of the highwall caused a toppling effect on the upper  feet of solid rock in the highwalljohn pennington a second shift bulldozer operator working in the redwine pit had observed a large vertical crack in the eastfacing highwall he indicated that upon further observation there appeared to be a large chimney or column of rock containing vertical cracks on each side possibly extending behind the column and the rock at the toe of the column appeared fractured and weak pennington contacted timothy wright second shift foreman who examined the highwall and determined it to be unstable wright removed all miners from the area and had the area partially bermed with earthen material to prevent entry the berm was reported to be  feet high by  feet in length and was constructed of shot material pushed up by a bulldozer around the unstable highwall area according to interview statements the earthen material berm ramped down on one end and created an access area to the highwall wright made an entry in his onshift record book stating a bad place came in wall bermed off wright did not post warning signs around the area that had been inadequately barricaded by the bermthe second shift normally ended at  am and the day shift began at  am the normal procedure used to communicate between shifts was a cell phone voice mail message left for the day shift superintendent by the second shift foreman according to wright the voice mail message left after the december   second shift did not include any warning of the unsafe highwall or of an area bermed off the message detailed production and equipment breakdownson december   at approximately  am the day shift crew began work in the redwine pit witness statements from george steele day shift foreman and daniel short day shift superintendent indicated that they conducted a preshift examination of the redwine pit area before the day shift began due to heavy rain the night before the examination was conducted before daylight and handheld lights and equipment lights were used to illuminate the highwall no hazardous conditions were detected during the examination steele stated that short assigned him work in other areas of the mine and steele did not return to the redwine pit before the accident steele stated he overheard short make the excavator operator aware of a crack in the highwall and told him he would examine the area once it was daylight short did not return to the pit area until after the accident occurredwitness statements indicated yonts was instructed by short to start loading shot material into the haul trucks from the redwine pit using the pc  komatsu excavator a komatsu wa  frontend wheel loader and a caterpillar g frontend wheel loader were normally used to load shot material into haul trucks both of these loaders had been out of service for several shifts because they needed mechanical repairs due to both rock loaders out of service a komatsu wa  coal loader was used to load haul trucks on the second shift on december   the komatsu wa  coal loader also incurred a mechanical breakdown and was taken out of service on the second shift wright instructed john davis loader operator to operate the komatsu pc  excavator for the remainder of the second shift to load the haul trucks from the redwine pit all the loaders were still unavailable when the day shift began working in the redwine pit on december   and yonts was assigned to load rock with the excavator on the day shiftaccording to witness statements short give directions to yonts regarding how the excavator needed to be oriented to load the shot material where to start loading and how to position the haulers to be loaded yonts maneuvered the excavator up a ramp onto the shot material and started loading haul trucks shortly after  am yonts positioned the excavator with the cab adjacent to the highwall face at the far end of the redwine pit backing toward the partially bermed section of highwall as he loaded trucksthe attempt to isolate and danger off the hazardous highwall on the previous shift consisted solely of pushing an earthen berm around the bad section of highwall no other barricades or warning signs were used the berm was not recognized by the oncoming shift as a barrier to prevent entry into an area with a hazardous condition witness statements revealed the day shift crew began work before steele or short reviewed the onshift book completed by wrightdelbert porter bulldozer operator was also working in the redwine pit pushing shot material in front of the excavator at  am while backing up the bulldozer porter observed the highwall raveling and attempted to contact yonts by cb radio before contact could be made the highwall fell

remarked the floor was clean and free of any rocklee instructed smith to notify emergency services the kentucky office of mine safety and licensing komsl and msha because of unstable highwall conditions equipment was mobilized to begin scaling the highwall from the top dave lander an armstrong employee positioned a komatsu pclc excavator and started scaling the highwall when loose material was removed a caterpillar g loader was sent into the pit to remove material from the pit floor this was done to gain access to the victims truck and the hitachi excavator that phelps had operatedkenneth allen executive vice president of operations for armstrong coal ronnie drake komsl district office supervisor and ted smith assistant district manager for msha arrived on site to coordinate and facilitate recovery of the miners at  am a plan of action was formulated to continue recovery operations using the  caterpillar loader working in the pit at  am the plan was modified to allow the excavator operated by lander to go back to the top of the highwall and pullscale other loose material at  am the plan was modified further to allow lander to operate a hitachi ex excavator in the pit to remove rock from around the hitachi excavator that phelps had been operating at the time of the accident the excavator operated by phelps had experienced damaged hydraulic lines and could not be used to move material once enough fallen rock was removed from this excavator more space was provided to allow lander to begin removing rock that would recover the bodies of winstead and lindsey the rock was removed and stacked to the side and occasionally was relocated further to the east in the pit by the caterpillar loader the victims were recovered at  pm by rescue workers and

the start of the shift section boss joe ontko conducted a safety meeting with dan fox timberman john bartnicki timberman vance rosier trackman james eden wireman roger van gosen trackman and mcintire after the safety meeting ontko gave work assignments for the shift eden van gosen and rosier were instructed to replace two track rails in the yard near the shop area fox bartnicki and mcintire were instructed to take equipment and clean up material that had fallen at  block of the main line haulage just inby the river portal between  and  pm fox and bartnicki pulled an empty coal car into the mine using a motor locomotive followed by mcintire who was pushing a track cleaning machine with a second motor ontko followed the motors by mantrip to the  location the crew arrived at approximately  pm and attempted to clean up and load out the fallen rocks it was determined that the rocks were too large for the track cleaning machine to load the men attempted break up the rocks after approximately fifteen minutes at the work location mcintire suggested to ontko that they should go back outside and obtain the ditch digging machine as it would be better suited for the jobontko traveled outside on the mantrip followed by mcintire who was pulling the track cleaner with a motor followed by fox and bartnicki pushing the empty car with another motor after arriving on the surface mcintire boarded the mantrip with ontko and proceeded to the no  empty switch in the supply yard where the ditch digging machine was located ontko instructed mcintire to take the ditch digging machine underground to remove the material mcintire indicated to ontko that his training for the ditch digging machine may have expired and he would need to be retrained ontko asked mcintire if he had operated the ditch digger previously and mcintire indicated he had ontko performed the task training the task training session lasted twenty to twenty five minutes upon completion ontko asked mcintire if he was comfortable with operating the machine and mcintire indicated he wasat approximately  pm the crew headed back into the mine ontko proceeded on the mantrip followed by mcintire operating the ditch digging machine fox and bartnicki followed mcintire on a motor pushing an empty car the crew returned to the  location attempts to load the large rocks with the ditch digging machine were again unsuccessful after approximately fifteen minutes and loading only two rocks with the machine the crew decided to take the ditch digging machine back outside and return with the track cleanerfox and

problem gray had difficulty raising the bridge but was able bumpwiggle the front boom which raised the bridge hoskins saw that the conveyor chain was broken on one side and called for the section repairman verdie myers hoskins had the area shoveled and rock dust scattered in an effort to dry the area where the repairs would be made the inspection cover on the inby end of the bridge conveyor was removed to check the conveyor chain the cover can be removed with the bridge conveyor resting on the mine floorduring repairs the hydraulic boom jacks would not maintain the bridge conveyor in the raised position which was attributed to the hydraulic pressure leaking gray had to raise the bridge repeatedly because it continued to drop back down hoskins asked for crib blocks to use as props but

and discussed the days work activities personal protective equipment ppe tie off with lanyards and using flash guarding when welding was discussed during the safety talkafter the meeting the ironworkers gathered their tools and proceeded to the second floor of the scalping tower construction site to start the days activities benally and n martin began cutting the metal plate loose from the east side of the chutew martin and hoffbauer proceeded to weld the metal beams the welding operations involved moving and repositioning a section of the floor grating near the chute the floor grating was used as a work platform to weld the beams to the cross members after completing the welding hoffbauer left the second floor of the scalping tower and continued installing cross bracing on the north side of the tower extension a mobile manlift was used for the higher locationsw martin n martin and benally continued working on the second floor using cutting torches to remove a metal

aggregate operator had replaced timothy thornley surface aggregate operator who was attending a training class that morning noble observed that the aggregate material was dry he requested that the aggregate stock pile be watered a water truck was used twice to suppress the dust noble reported that he loaded aggregates with a frontend loader into the grizzly surface hopper for about  hours before the aggregate electrical system tripped out and a red warning light came on at the feed grizzly on the surface figure  electrical records indicated the aggregate delivery system shut down at approimately  pm noble thought an electrical acoustic sensor was faulty causing the shutdown noble checked the feed belt conveyor and the surface transfer bo located above the three aggregate delivery pipes he found the transfer bo full and the belt conveyor overflowing with aggregate records of the electrical system showed that noble had dumped  bucket loads of aggregate into the system prior to the shut downmitch roberts batch plant operator started his shift at  am on august   at the underground batch plant roberts stated the aggregate silo was not full at the beginning of the shift but became full during the shift roberts said the lens on the monitoring camera near the aggregate silo was fogging which made seeing the silo level difficult therefore he could not determine how much material was in the silo roberts estimated he loaded  trucks out of the batch plant he was operating the batch plant when the aggregate delivery pipe clogged after the underground silo filled the material continued to back up in the aggregate delivery pipe until it reached the surfacenoble contacted the batch plant underground at approimately  pm soon after the aggregate system stopped operating noble spoke with charles taylor batch plant operator who replaced roberts as the batch plant operator shortly after the aggregate pipe clogged taylor informed noble it had been a slow day with only two trucks hauling about  batches out noble went underground to the  rock bo and noticed the rock bo and chute were full of aggregate figure  he returned to the surface and met with richard nunn leadman and thornley noble told them the aggregate pipe was full nunn assigned noble to another task underground and instructed thornley to begin working to unplug the systemted suthers toplander was at the collar of the shaft loading supply materials to be sent underground he observed the aggregate pipe system was plugged all the way to the surface and that material was overflowing at the rock transfer bo on the surface suthers stated the electrical button switch to the aggregate feed system for the pipe had been reset several times during the shift he saw noble go to the control panel several times during the day shift prior to the accident suthers stated he had observed a broom handle wedged between the wall and the reset control paneltaylor continued to load trucks underground and the silo level was moving down but the aggregate in the pipe would not flowthornley cleaned up around the belt conveyor on the surface he went underground and used an air lance to clear material in the chute leading out from the  rock bo three access doors were located on the chute two on the lower end and one on the upper end thornley observed a solid column of material between the bottom of the inch pipe going into the rock bo and the inside of the rock bo since the day shift was nearly over thornley did not attempt to unbolt the latch door on the rock bo and clear this column of materialdaniel noel victim started his shift at  pm on august   he met with nunn and thornley they told noel that the pipe was plugged they tried to unplug it but could not clear the blockage nunn informed noel that the underground batch plant was still operating because there was enough aggregate in the underground storage silo noel called ken anderson batch plant operator and told him the aggregate silo was full so he would have enough material to operateat approimately  pm noel assigned matt inama backfill operator to clean up the surface area of the aggregate delivery system while john conklin jammer operator and noel attempted to unplug the system underground inama observed the light flashing on the panel at the surface indicating a plug at the  level he went underground and observed the aggregate material in the  level rock bo noel and conklin went underground to the  level and looked into the lower chute door below the rock bo and saw that it was clear of material conklin looked at the upper chute door and saw that material was built up in the rock bo and the pipe was full using an air lance conklin attempted to break up the clog conklin was able to clear out some of the material in the rock bo and was able to establish air space between the clogged material in the pipe and the dead bed below in the rock bojoel schorr victim started his shift at  pm on august   schorr was working underground when he was contacted around midnight by noel to accompany him to the ventilation shaft to clear the plugged aggregate pipe schorr contacted david johnson hoist operator and told johnson that he and noel needed to go into the shaft to check the plugged pipe at  am noel and schorr boarded the top of the hoist conveyance from the  level observing a remote camera johnson saw the men board the top of the conveyance carrying a shorthandle ae both men were observed wearing full body harness fall protection as the conveyance approached the  level the speed was slowed to  feet per minute they started hitting the aggregate pipe just above the rock bo and worked their way up the pipe conklin who was positioned on top of the rock bo observed the material start to fall and flow as noel and schorr worked their way up the shaft conklin described the activity of striking the pipe as tapping on it rather than beating conklin said they stopped  feet above him and then made two more short moves with the conveyance at which point he could not see them at approimately  am conklin stated there was a sudden large surge of material coming down the pipe he immediately shut the door on top of the rock bo but the material overwhelmed the bo and the door blew open conklin turned his back to the falling pipes and debris and made his way down the steps to get help schorr and noel were fatally struck by the falling pipe and aggregatejohnson had been monitoring pressures on the hoist hydraulics one of the men used the bell cord to signal when to start and stop the conveyance johnson started and stopped the conveyance  or  times and had slowed the travel speed down to  feet per minute the last elevation he recalled was  feet he stated the hoist had been running about  psi when the pressure on the hoist suddenly spiked to  psi and the hoist drum was ripped from its mounts the needle on the hoists controller indicated the elevation of the conveyance was above the  level at approimately  am anderson heard a noise and could see rock fly out of the transfer bo at the  level on the control room video monitor the monitor then went deadimmediately after the accident occurred the mine operator started an etensive rescue and recovery operation the mine safety and health administration msha was notified of the accident at  am on august   by a telephone call from thomas bassier manager safety and health to mshas emergency call center rodney gust staff assistant was notified at  am an order was issued under the provisions of

at the mine to coordinate efforts with the mine rescue teams rescue teams began searching the areas in and around the ventilation shaft for any signs of the two miners a camera was dropped down the ventilation shaft but neither miner was discovered rescue teams broke through a bulkhead at the  level and encountered a log jam of pipes brackets clamps and aggregate efforts to rescue and or recover the two miners were hampered by the amount of material that had been destroyed and the condition of the ventilation shaft after etensive efforts to locate the miners they were recovered on august

examined the working faces the crew then proceeded to their work areas barnhart was approached by charlie dye integral roof bolter operator right side who was walking off the d overcast dye informed barnhart there was a crack in the left side rib adjacent to the continuous mining machine an unsuccessful attempt had been made to pry down the rib on the midnight shift by dye barnhart then walked to the continuous mining machine and retracted the automated temporary roof supports atrs and rib protectors and moved the machine towards the left side of the entry for servicing he then proceeded to check the bits on the cutterhead and determined there were several bits broken off in the bit holder buckley was called to work on the bits the bits were repaired and the water sprays were cleanedjoe morgan foreman mentor was also on the section when the accident occurred morgan had walked from the d section to the south section and examined the faces on the right side of the section he noticed the section had not yet begun to mine on the left side and traveled to the belt overcast where the continuous mining machine was located he walked to the front of the continuous mining machine with barnhart to examine the roof and ribs the roof and ribs were determined to be safe by both individuals the continuous mining machine was located approximately  feet from the face during their examination during this time banko and adkins were in the process of hauling supplies to the continuous mining machine mayle began another examination of the no  to no  entries at approximately  am during the investigation of the accident the date board indicated the no  face which was located at the bottom of the belt overcast was examined at  am soon after making examinations mayle walked onto

barnhart actuated the panic bar which removed power from the continuous mining machine barnhart and banko went around the boom of the continuous mining machine and found the victim pinned against the left side he was located outby the rib protector near the rear bumper the rock that struck the victim measured  inches in length by  inches high and up to  inches thickthe general practice of the integral roof bolter operators at the loveridge  mine was to stand towards the rear of the machine outside the protection of the rib protector see photo of rib protector in appendix e while the continuous miner was cutting the roof for an overcast they chose to stand at this location so they would not be struck by flying rock and debrismorgan was adjusting the laser sight located behind the loading machine when he heard barnhart yell out for help the laser sight had been struck by a piece of mobile equipment during the previous shift or when the scoop was supplying the continuous mining machine morgan proceeded to the accident site to assist due to the size and weight of the rock they were unable to lift the rock off the victim morgan then went to the right side section to get help

reported for work at  am his normal starting time larry e stine superintendent presented a tool box talk for all employees and then assigned tasks to everyone afterward trimmer performed his assigned maintenance dutiesabout  am gerald a evans secondary plant operator noticed the feeder in the surge tunnel contained too many fines this situation was referred to as free flowing evans called stine on the radio to report the problem and then went into the surge tunnel to check the feeder stine went to the plant and noticed stone was still coming out of the surge tunnel on the belt conveyor no  belt evans told stine that nothing was broken on the feeder and he was returning to the control room to check on the other belt conveyorsstine entered the surge tunnel to determine how to correct the problem with the feeder shortly after evans noticed the no  belt shut off and the console lights indicated another belt conveyor no  belt was not operating stine called scott m stahle maintenance superintendent on his cell phone to discuss the problem with the free flowing feederstine came out of the surge tunnel and gave trimmer his phone to talk to stahle stahle then told trimmer how to repair the feeder stahle said a restrictor plate used to regulate flow of material should be placed in front of the feeder evans went to the entrance of the surge tunnel and told stine the belt conveyor going to the mill had stalled and he would check the counterweight for the no  belt stine left trimmer to address these additional problemstrimmer and joseph a newsome haul truck driver entered the surge tunnel trimmer decided to install the restrictor plate at a different location in the feeder chute than was originally planned trimmer crawled onto the belt conveyor leaned into the chute from the front and took a measurement trimmer then left the tunnel to cut a metal plate to complete the repairs after receiving instructions from stine newsome left trimmer to drive his truck under the secondary a bin to empty itevans started the belt conveyors including the no  belt and the feeder the gauges in the secondary control room indicated that the no  belt was empty the rheostat for the feeder was turned to  percent and the feeder was turned on and off five or six times at that point evans thought that the feeder was empty or day lighted because he heard a hollow sound the no  belt and feeder were then shut downtrimmer obtained the materials needed to install the restrictor plate and returned to the office to retrieve his glasses stine drove trimmer back to the surge tunnel and instructed him not to enter the feeder unless the pile was moved back away from the no  belt feeder hopper inlet ringed evans newsome and trimmer locked out and tagged the power for the no  belt and took the restrictor plate and additional pieces of angle iron into the surge tunnel to modify the feedertrimmer told them he was going to install a restrictor plate in the chute and cut it to adjust the flow as needed trimmer welded two pieces of steel angle horizontally to the side walls of the chute from the belt side of the hopper gate he then placed the inch by inch by inch steel plate which he had previously cut on the steel angles and attempted to force it in place however he could not move the plate to a vertical position trimmer then crawled into the feeder hopper under the steel plate apparently he wanted to see what was preventing the plate from rotating to the vertical position although the feeder hopper had been day lighted a cone of steeply angled material from the primary surge pile remained around the openingtrimmer determined that another piece of angle needed to be cut and installed evans handed trimmer a tape measure and asked if the front of the feeder needed to be raised to adjust the flow rather than installing the plate about  am trimmer continued to take measurements inside the hopper when a small amount of stone fell causing evans to jump back shortly after that a large amount of stone fell engulfing trimmerevans and newsome attempted to free trimmer but material kept falling around them the stone was too large to shovel so they dug with their hands evans ran outside and shouted for help george e jumper water truck driver responded and radioed for stine stine and robert l olsen fine grind plant supervisor entered the tunnel to help dig stine ran out of the tunnel to call on his cell phone for emergency assistance jumper don e halblieb and william shaffer loader operators entered the tunnel to assist in the digging due to the size of the stones surrounding trimmer all digging by rescuers was performed by hand about  am emergency medical services and numerous fire department personnel arrived at the mine and took over the rescue operations for about one hour they unsuccessfully tried to remove trimmer from the chute but their efforts were sporadically interrupted by additional falling material at  am an emergency medical technician pronounced trimmer dead and the rescue workers left the surge tunnelon the surface a frontend loader and an excavator were used to remove the primary surge pile in order to gain access to the feeder from above once the material was moved away from the feeder recovery workers reentered the surge tunnel considerable time and care were taken to ensure the safety of the recovery team throughout the entire rescue and recovery operations trimmer was recovered from the chute at  pm the cause of death was attributed to asphyxiation

the  right crosscut the roof bolting crew installed two rows of roof support and todd trammed the roof bolting machine forward in preparation of installing a third row rocky offside operator guided the machine into place as it was trammed forward rocky used a piece of key steel welded on top of the canopy as a reference point when guiding the bolt machine into position when the piece of key steel was positioned underneath the last installed roof bolt he signaled todd to stop tramming the machine forward this ensured that the distance between the rows of roof bolts did not exceed  feet todd then set the atrs of the roof bolting machine against the mine roof this was the normal procedure for advancing the roof bolting machine in the face areas rocky stated that he made a visual observation of the roof conditions and listened to the roof as the atrs was set he did not detect any adverse roof conditions during either test he did not observe any loose rock that had fallen when
