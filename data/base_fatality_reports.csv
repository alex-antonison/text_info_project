DirectorRyan I. Charbonneau ……………………………………………. General ManagerThe Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection of this mine on October 2, 2018.\xa0 The non-fatal days lost (NFDL) incident rate for the Northeast Aggregate Corporation for 2018 was zero, compared to the national average of 1.35.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On July 15, 2019, Ryan Charbonneau attempted to remove the hammer from the excavator before using it to remove the old motor from the portable jaw crusher work platform.\xa0 He was unable to disengage the hammer from the excavator’s quick coupler and decided to leave the hammer attached to the excavator.\xa0 The excavator was used to break oversize rocks in the quarry up until the time of the accident.On July 17, 2019, Robert Root, Equipment Operator; Theodore S. Gilman, Quarry Manager; Paul Tipper, Equipment Operator; and Gary L. McAllister, Equipment Operator, arrived at 7:00 a.m. for the morning shift. \xa0Tipper began operating the excavator and noticed there was a hydraulic oil leak in the mechanism that latched the hammer to the quick coupler.\xa0 Tipper notified Gilman of the leak, and Gilman and McAllister examined the equipment. They were unable to find the cause and location of the hydraulic oil leak. \xa0To prevent further leakage, Gilman removed the two hydraulic oil hoses connected to the quick coupler latching mechanism and load-locking valve arrangement.\xa0 Gilman then covered (capped) the two ports on the load-locking valve arrangement of the quick coupler and the two hydraulic supply ports on the excavator boom.At approximately 10:45 a.m., Charbonneau arrived at the mine site and Gilman and McAllister informed him that the hydraulic ports had been capped.\xa0 He spoke with Gilman and McAllister about the decision to cap the hydraulic ports.\xa0 The three men examined the latching mechanism before deciding to proceed. McAllister moved the excavator from the quarry to the crusher and informed Root that the hydraulic ports had been capped. \xa0Root then began operating the excavator.Charbonneau and McAllister walked to the crusher work platform to guide the excavator into position to remove the old motor.\xa0 Charbonneau was standing next to the crusher booth on the east side of the platform.\xa0 McAllister was standing on the west side of the platform, just above the crusher flywheel (see Appendix A). \xa0Root began to position the excavator’s boom and hammer while Charbonneau and McAllister directed him with hand signals. \xa0Charbonneau was standing below the hammer, which was approximately 7.5 feet above the work platform.\xa0 When Root rotated the hammer to the horizontal position, the hammer fell from the quick coupler, striking Charbonneau in the head, knocking him down, and pinning him to the work platform.McAllister yelled for help.\xa0 Gilman, who was returning from parking his truck, grabbed a chain and used it to attach the hammer to the excavator boom.\xa0 Root used the excavator to lift the hammer off of Charbonneau.\xa0 Miners were not able to completely remove Charbonneau from under the hammer until additional equipment was brought to the site.\xa0 The additional equipment was needed because the excavator did not have the lifting capacity due to the loss of hydraulic oil.At approximately 11:55 a.m., Gilman called 911 and requested medical assistance.\xa0 At 12:03 p.m., emergency medical crews arrived at the mine site, and at 12:13 p.m., Steven Stryker, AmCare Ambulance Paramedic, pronounced the victim dead do to extensive trauma.', 'INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT': 'At 12:14 p.m., Gilman called the Department of Labor National Contact Center (DOLNCC).\xa0 The DOLNCC notified Dennis Yesko, MSHA’s Northeastern District Assistant District Manager, who dispatched John Burton, Mine Safety and Health Inspector, to the mine site.\xa0 Upon arrival, Burton secured the scene and ensured the safety of the miners.\xa0At 5:11 p.m., Everett G. Kinser and Daniel F. Pullen, Mine Safety and Health Inspectors in MSHA’s Portsmouth, New Hampshire field office, arrived on the scene to conduct the fatal accident investigation.\xa0 Upon arrival, Kinser issued a 103(k) order.\xa0 MSHA’s accident investigation team conducted a physical examination of the accident scene, interviewed five mine employees and seven contractor employees, reviewed training documentation, and examined work procedures relevant to the accident.\xa0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, mine employees, local law enforcement, and rescue agencies.\xa0 See Appendix B for a list of persons participating in the investigation.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Location of AccidentThe accident occurred on the west side of the crusher control booth on a Cedarapids portable jaw crusher work platform (see Appendix C).WeatherThe weather at the time of the accident was cloudy with an average temperature of 80° F. \xa0Investigators did not consider weather to be a factor in the accident.Equipment InvolvedThe equipment involved in the accident was a Caterpillar 325B L excavator, product identification number 2JR02784. \xa0At the time of the accident, the excavator was equipped with a Fleco 325B C-linkage quick coupler and a Gorilla GHB150 hydraulic hammer (see Appendix D).\xa0 This attachment assembly was provided and installed by Perry’s Equipment Inc. of Swanton, Vermont several years prior to the accident.The hammer was secured to the excavator’s quick coupler by a latch.\xa0 The hammer has a carrier on one side that connects to the quick coupler, and the latch holds the hammer’s carrier securely.\xa0 Two systems cause the latch to remain closed and hold the hammer’s carrier securely.\xa0 The two systems are the primary latching system and the secondary latching system.Primary Latching SystemThe primary latching system is controlled by a hydraulic cylinder. \xa0When the hydraulic cylinder is extended, it closes the latch, and when the hydraulic cylinder is retracted, it opens the latch.\xa0 The primary latching system is designed so that hydraulic pressure, on the extend side of the hydraulic cylinder, causes the hydraulic cylinder to keep the latch in the closed position at all times when the excavator is operating.\xa0 The latch will remain closed unless a series of switches inside the cab are used to open the latch. \xa0A check valve prevents the latch from opening if hydraulic power to the extend side of the hydraulic cylinder is lost.Disconnected and Damaged Hydraulic SystemAs mentioned earlier, Gilman removed the two hydraulic hoses connected to the hydraulic cylinder from the excavator and installed caps on all four fittings. In addition, investigators found that the tube welded to the extend side of the hydraulic cylinder was cracked and the tube welded to the retract side of the hydraulic cylinder was broken into two pieces. This defeated the load locking valve feature for the latch and allowed a constant flow of hydraulic oil to leak (see Appendices F and G).Secondary Latching SystemA secondary latching system used a safety pin arrangement to mechanically keep the latch from opening (see Appendices E and H).\xa0 The safety pin can be inserted into one of two holes in excavator’s quick coupler.\xa0 The proper hole depends on the amount of separation of the two pins in the hammer’s carrier.\xa0 The operator’s manual for the quick coupler indicated that the maximum recommended pin separation for the type of pins in the hammer’s carrier, is 475 mm.\xa0 The separation of the pins in hammer’s carrier was 520 mm which circumvented the safety pin as a secondary means of securely holding the hammer’s carrier. \xa0\xa0SummaryWhen Root rotated the hammer to the horizontal position, the weight of the hammer on the latch and hydraulic cylinder forced hydraulic oil out of the cracked tube and through a broken weld where the load locking valve arrangement was welded in place.\xa0 As the hydraulic oil evacuated the tube, the latch opened. \xa0The secondary means also failed due to the incompatibility of the quick coupler and hammer’s carrier. \xa0The hammer fell because the primary and secondary latching systems could not serve their intended function.Training and ExperienceCharbonneau had over 14 years of mining experience, all with Northeast.\xa0 MSHA determined there were no contributory training deficiencies.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'The accident investigation team conducted a root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the accident.\xa0 The team identified the following root causes and the mine operator implemented the corresponding corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\xa0 The accident occurred because the operator did not repair the disconnected and damaged hydraulic cylinder assembly for the quick coupler or remove it from service after discovering a hydraulic oil leak.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The quick coupler involved in the accident was removed from service.\xa0 Mine management and miners have been reinstructed on the provisions of 30 CFR § 56.14100 including the removal of unsafe equipment that affects the safety of miners.Root Cause:\xa0 The accident occurred because the operator used an incompatible carrier attachment. \xa0The mismatched equipment components circumvented the secondary latching system allowing the hammer to disengage from the quick coupler when the primary means of latching failed.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 Management removed the quick coupler from the excavator and adopted a policy eliminating the use of quick coupling devices at this operation. \xa0The operator will ensure that all equipment is used within the design capacity of the manufacturer.', 'CONCLUSION': 'Ryan I.

ACCIDENT': 'On June 10, 2019, Sawasky arrived at the mine site at 6:00 a.m., to continue installing electrical lines for a new plant.\xa0 Premier’s Foreman, Greg Turcotte, met with Sawasky and Travis Hegemann, Journeyman Electrician, to conduct the morning safety briefing and discuss the day’s tasks.\xa0 The three men walked over to a trench for electrical lines, to see the impact of a recent rain event.Turcotte determined the trench was too muddy to work safely, so he coordinated with Joseph Peters, Plant Manager, to remove the mud.\xa0 Peters used an excavator to clear the mud from the trench.\xa0 He also placed a six-by-two-foot concrete block at the head of the trench to serve as a mounting structure for an electrical junction box.\xa0 Before leaving the area, Turcotte coordinated with Peters to replace the mud with crushed rock.\xa0 Turcotte then left the mine site to obtain additional construction material.\xa0 Bruce Batson, Maintenance/Equipment Operator, delivered approximately half a bucket of crushed stone using a Caterpillar 980H front-end loader.\xa0 He put some stone into the trench and dumped the remainder along the trench for later placement.Hegemann coordinated with Peters to bring an additional four loads of crusher fines to the trench to use as bedding for the conduit.\xa0 Peters operated a Wacker Neuson WL36 front-end loader to deliver the crusher fines from a nearby stockpile. \xa0A pile of crushed rock, other materials, and equipment in front of and adjacent to the trench impeded Peters’ approach to the trench.\xa0 Peters had to approach the trench at about a 30-degree angle and then turn to the right, which placed the bucket of the front-end loader parallel to the trench (see Appendix A).Hegemann acted as a spotter for Peters when he dumped the first three buckets of crusher fines into the trench. \xa0After Peters dumped the third bucket of crusher fines, Hegemann got in the trench to mount steel struts to the concrete block for the junction box.\xa0 Sawasky stood next to him, assisting.\xa0 Hegemann was not spotting when Peters delivered the fourth load.At approximately 11:10 a.m., as Peters was preparing to dump the fourth load, the right-front wheel of the front-end loader went over the edge and into the trench.\xa0 Peters yelled out a warning and Hegemann jumped back out of the way.\xa0 The front-end loader rolled and slid down into the trench, with its bumper coming to rest on the concrete block.Hegemann watched Peters climb out of the front-end loader cab and then turned to see that Sawasky was pinned between the front-end loader and the concrete block.\xa0 Hegemann called to Turcotte, who had returned to the site, to call 911.\xa0 He then climbed to the top of the block and tried to speak to Sawasky, who was not responsive.Peters assisted emergency medical services by using a large excavator to lift the fallen front-end loader to free Sawasky at 11:25 a.m.\xa0 Kelli Derleth, Medicolegal Death Investigator, examined Sawasky and pronounced him dead at 12:06 p.m.\xa0', 'INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT': 'At 11:31 a.m., Brandon Clemons, Vulcan’s Safety Representative, called the Department of Labor’s National Contact Center (DOLNCC).\xa0 At 11:43 a.m., the DOLNCC contacted David Allen, MSHA Southeastern District Safety Specialist, who dispatched Scottie Sizemore, Mine Safety and Health Inspector, and Darren Conn, Supervisory Mine Safety and Health Inspector, in MSHA’s Franklin, Tennessee field office, to the mine site.\xa0 Sizemore and Conn arrived at 1:24 p.m., and issued an order under Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to secure the scene and ensure the safety of miners.Rory Smith, Supervisory Mine Safety and Health Inspector, in MSHA’s Birmingham, Alabama field office and Kevin Hardester, Mine Safety and Health Inspector, arrived on the scene at 4:30 p.m., to conduct a fatal injury accident investigation.\xa0 MSHA’s accident investigation team conducted a physical examination of the accident scene, interviewed five mine employees and seven contractor employees, reviewed training documentation, and examined work procedures relevant to the accident.\xa0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, miners, and contractors. \xa0See Appendix B for a list of persons participating in the investigation.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Location of AccidentThe accident occurred in an area where the operator was building a secondary processing plant.\xa0 The electrical contractors were preparing to place electrical conduit and a junction box in a trench at the perimeter of the new plant site.\xa0 The trench was approximately seven-feet wide and ranged from four to six feet deep.\xa0 The walls were slightly sloped (see Appendix C), and there was a shallow ramp at the head of the trench for access.\xa0EquipmentA Wacker Neuson WL36, front-end loader, Serial #3025335, with a bucket capacity of .8 cubic yards was involved in the accident (see Appendix D). \xa0\xa0River Road Quarry has only one front-end loader of this model and they have trained multiple miners to operate it.\xa0 There were no documented mechanical issues with the front-end loader.\xa0 Maintenance records did not indicate any current or recurring issues.\xa0 After inspecting pre-operational examination records and conducting interviews, the accident investigators concluded that the mine operator was performing required examinations and there were no reported safety defects or concerns prior to the accident.Weather ConditionsThe weather at the time of the accident was mostly cloudy, no precipitation, and a temperature of 77° F. \xa0Rainfall over the previous weekend made further excavation of the trench necessary to correct the muddy conditions.\xa0 Investigators did not consider the weather to be a factor in the accident.Training and ExperiencePeters received training in operating the front-end loader.\xa0 He had approximately six months of experience at this site and approximately three years of total mining experience.\xa0 Collin Sawasky’s training records indicated he had received new miner training; site-specific training; annual refresher training; and task training on various pieces of equipment.\xa0', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'The accident investigation team conducted a root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the accident.\xa0 The team identified the following root causes and the mine operator implemented the corresponding corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not maintain control of the front-end loader to prevent overtravel into the trench.\nCorrective Action: The mine operator provided additional training to all equipment operators on how to operate equipment in a safe and controlled manner.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not use berms or other limiting devices to prevent overtravel of equipment when approaching a drop-off to dump material.\nCorrective Action: The mine operator developed and implemented new policies and procedures to ensure miners’ safety when dumping material near an edge of a drop-off, and provided training to miners in the new policies and procedures.', 'CONCLUSION': 'Collin Sawasky died when a front-end loader toppled into the trench where he

North was taken from the mine and transported by helicopter to a hospital.\xa0 On Thursday, May 30, 2019, North passed away due to complications from injuries received during the accident.\xa0\xa0The accident occurred because the mine operator did not effectively control the ribs on the 002 Mechanized Mining Unit (MMU).\xa0', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'The CVB No. 1 mine, owned and operated by Rex Coal Company, Inc., is an underground coal mine developed in the Harlan coal seam.\xa0 It is located approximately 2.5 miles from Cumberland, Harlan County, Kentucky.\xa0 The CVB No. 1 mine has two MMUs and utilizes room and pillar mining methods.\xa0 Coal is mined with continuous mining machines, transported by shuttle cars to a feeder, and transported to the surface via a belt conveyor system.\xa0 Mining heights range from six to ten feet.\xa0 The mine operates three nine-hour shifts per day, five to six days per week, employs 94 underground miners, and produces an average of 2,600 tons of raw coal per day.The principal officers for the company at the time of the accident were:Joseph T. Bennett ......................................................................................... PresidentThomas Loving............................................................................... Human ResourcesAllen Turner........................................................................................ SuperintendentThe Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular (E01) safety and health inspection on March 22, 2019.\xa0 At the time of the accident, an E01 inspection was ongoing and an MSHA inspector was on another section (001 MMU) when the accident occurred.\xa0 Prior to May 22, 2019, the last day an MSHA inspector was on the 002 MMU was May 13, 2019.\xa0 The non-fatal days lost (NFDL) incidence rate for the mine in 2018 was 2.53, compared to a national NFDL rate of 3.13 for mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On Wednesday, May 22, 2019, at approximately 2:00 p.m., the second shift coal production crew traveled to the 002 MMU to begin work, arriving at approximately 2:50 p.m.\xa0 Along with North, the crew consisted of a foreman, an electrician, two shuttle car operators, four roof bolters and a scoop operator.Following pre-operational checks, the crew began production in the No. 3 left crosscut at approximately 3:40 p.m. (see Appendix A). \xa0North began to tram the mining machine uphill in wet and muddy conditions, in which it became stuck from approximately 4:40 p.m. to 5:40 p.m.\xa0 At approximately 5:40 p.m., after completing the initial left hand lift cut, crew members prepared to reposition the mining machine for a right hand lift cut. \xa0Shuttle car operator Jonathan Dean moved his shuttle car out of the way and North backed up the continuous mining machine.At approximately 6:10 p.m., North was moving the continuous mining machine’s power cable near the corner of the pillar when a portion of the coal/rock rib fell on him, pinning him to the mine floor.\xa0 Dean, who witnessed the accident, rushed to North and called out for help. \xa0Other crew members ran to the scene. \xa0Scoop operator Jonathan Holbrook stabilized North’s head while shuttle car operators Carl Collett and Jonathan Dean and roof bolters Austin Vannatter and Charles England worked to free him from under the rock. \xa0North was responsive and communicated that his leg and hip hurt.Once North was freed, section foreman Howard P. Huskey directed Dean to go to the section power center to call outside and get first aid supplies. \xa0At the power center, Dean called David Eldridge, Security Officer, to alert him of the accident and request an ambulance.\xa0 Eldridge contacted Thomas Loving of Human Resources and Loving called 911, the Department of Labor National Contact Center (DOL Contact Center), and the Kentucky Division of Mine Safety (KDMS).\xa0Dean also called mine foreman Tommy Vannatter who was on the 001 MMU at the time of the accident. \xa0T. Vannatter immediately went to help transport North to the surface.When Dean returned to the accident scene, he moved his shuttle car to clear the way for Huskey to pull in with the personnel carrier. \xa0The crew placed North on the backboard and into the carrier and transported him to the surface. \xa0North never lost consciousness during this time.After arriving on the surface at 7:08 p.m., North was transferred to medical personnel with LifeGuard Ambulance Service, who transported him about two miles to a designated landing zone.\xa0 At 7:30 p.m., he was flown by AirMedCare to the Johnson City Medical Center in Johnson City, Tennessee.\xa0 North underwent several surgical procedures at the Medical Center, and died of complications from his injuries on May 30, 2019. \xa0', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On May 22, 2019, at 7:30 p.m., Loving notified the DOL Contact Center of a life threatening injury accident.\xa0 The DOL Contact Center notified Marvin Hoskins, MSHA Hazard, KY Field Office Supervisor (FOS), who in turn notified Craig Plumley, Assistant District Manager for Enforcement. \xa0Plumley directed William C. Clark, MSHA Barbourville, KY FOS, to travel to the mine and assist with the accident investigation.\xa0At the time of the accident, Jack Harris, MSHA Inspector, was conducting inspection activities on the 001 MMU. \xa0As noted earlier, T. Vannatter went to help transport North to the surface as soon as he heard about the accident.\xa0 When T. Vannatter returned to the 001 MMU, he found Harris, and informed him of the accident. \xa0Harris and T. Vannatter then traveled to the accident scene. \xa0At 8 p.m., Harris issued a 103(k) order, conducted an imminent danger run, and took photos and preliminary measurements of the accident scene.\xa0 Clark arrived at the mine to assist Harris at approximately 9:00 p.m.On May 23, 2019, Dennis Cotton, Assistant District Manager for Technical, Kevin Doan, Roof Control Specialist, and Ricky L. Suffridge, Roof Control Specialist/Accident Investigator traveled to the mine to continue the investigation. \xa0Cotton and Doan traveled to the accident site with KDMS investigators Billy Allen, Ernest Hawkins, Dustin Clem, and Brandon Morgan, Safety Director for Rex Coal Company, to evaluate the roof and rib conditions. \xa0Meanwhile, Suffridge traveled to the 001 MMU with Allen Turner, Mine Superintendent, to evaluate roof and rib conditions at that location to see if hazardous conditions extended to the 001 MMU.\xa0 Later that afternoon, Timothy L. Fugate, Chief Accident Investigator at KDMS, and Clark from MSHA arrived at the mine to join the investigation. \xa0Investigators conducted preliminary interviews with most of the miners who had worked with North as they arrived for the start of the second shift. \xa0After completing the interviews, investigators Suffridge, Clark, Fugate, Hawkins, Turner, and Morgan traveled underground to the 002 MMU and took additional photographs and measurements.On May 30, 2019, MSHA was notified that North had passed away at the Johnson City Medical Center.\xa0 Interviews were conducted on Tuesday, June 4, 2019 at the MSHA Harlan Field Office (see Appendix B).On May 31, 2019 and June 1, 2019, Deborah B. Combs, Training Specialist with MSHA Educational Field and Small Mine Services, reviewed training records at the mine.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Accident SceneThe accident occurred at the intersection of the No. 3 heading and the No. 3 left crosscut (see Appendix A).\xa0 During the shift before the accident, the No. 3 heading was mined and the No. 3 left crosscut was mined approximately 20 feet.\xa0 These mined areas were roof bolted but no rib bolts were installed.Geologic ConditionsThe CVB No. 1 mine extracts coal from the Harlan coal seam and is overlain by abandoned workings in the Creech and High Splint coalbeds.\xa0 The interburden between the Harlan and Creech coal seams averages 370 feet.\xa0 The interburden between the Harlan and the High Splint seams averages 1,450 feet.The rock strata at the accident scene consisted of coal, cannel coal, and sandy shale (see Appendix C).\xa0 The rock that fell onto the victim came from the upper layer of sandy shale, which was 24 inches in width at the scene of the accident.\xa0 At the scene of the accident, the coal seam was starting to rise in elevation.\xa0 The elevation in the coal seam at the scene of the accident caused instability, in that the inby crosscut pillar corner leaned toward the continuous mining machine operator’s location.\xa0Roof Control PlanThe approved roof control plan required rib bolting in areas with specific geological characteristics. \xa0For example, rib bolting was required where the overburden was 1,000 feet. \xa0The overburden on the 002 MMU at the time of the accident was 900 feet so it did not meet the criteria requiring rib bolting.ExaminationsInvestigators reviewed preshift and onshift examination records for two months before the fatal accident.\xa0 Rib hazards were frequently documented in these records.\xa0 The records, and conditions in the mine, showed that the mine operator scaled loose rock and installed rib bolts as conditions were observed. \xa0The rib bolts installed were 6-foot fully grouted bolts spaced on 8 foot centers (horizontally).\xa0 Despite these efforts by the mine operator, rib hazards continued to develop.\xa0On May 22, 2019, the day of the accident, preshift examination records for the 002 MMU showed two notations regarding ribs: “Loose Rib” under the heading of “Hazardous Condition(s)”, and “Pulled” under the heading, “Action Taken.”\xa0 The on-shift examination record for that day listed one remark concerning the ribs, “Pulled loose ribs & drawrock.”\xa0 In preshift and on-shift examination records for the 7 days prior to the accident, there were notations of loose ribs.\xa0 All of these rib hazards were noted as being pulled down to remove the hazard.\xa0 The preshift and on-shift examination records were signed and countersigned as required.Post-accident interviews of the 002 MMU miners and supervisor indicated that the rib that caused the accident did not appear hazardous prior to falling.Roof Bolting Machines on the 002 MMUTwo types of roof bolting machines were utilized on the 002 MMU.\xa0 One machine only installed roof bolts. \xa0The other bolting machine was a mast-head drill primarily used to install rib bolts.\xa0 On occasion, if the roof bolting was lagging, the operator would use the mast-head drill to roof bolt and rib bolt.The mine operator was installing rib bolts in the area of the accident.\xa0 However, rib bolts provide the best protection when they are installed at the same time as roof bolts and in a consistent pattern.\xa0 Rib bolts on the 002 MMU were not being installed at the same time as the roof bolts.TrainingCombs reviewed training records and determined that North’s training was up-to-date.\xa0 He had received continuous mining machine task training on December 28, 2018, annual refresher training on October 13, 2018, and experienced miner training on November 11, 2018.\xa0 Combs determined all 29 second shift employees’ training records were up-to-date and found no training deficiencies.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 A root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.\xa0Listed below is the root cause identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions which were implemented to prevent a recurrence.\xa0Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not effectively control the ribs and pillar corners on the 002 MMU in areas where the miners were working and traveling to protect them from hazards related to falls of the ribs.\xa0 A portion of a coal/rock rib weighing about 2,000 pounds and measuring 48-to-54 inches long, 24 inches wide, and 28 inches thick fell on the 002 MMU.\xa0 The rib struck a miner and pinned him to the mine floor.\xa0 The miner passed away from injuries due to the rib fall.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 On May 24, 2019, the mine operator submitted, and MSHA approved, a revision to the roof control plan.\xa0 The new provisions of the plan require that all ribs be bolted at the same time roof bolts are installed in all areas of the mine and in a consistent pattern.\xa0 Furthermore, in accordance to the new plan provisions, each pillar corner must be supported with a combination of rib bolts and straps (or equivalent material).\xa0On May 24, 2019, all miners were trained by the mine operator on the provisions of the revised roof control plan.\xa0 Documentation of miners receiving the training was provided.', 'CONCLUSION': 'On Wednesday, May 22, 2019, at approximately 6:10 p.m., Felix Matthew (Matt) North, a 48-year-old continuous mining machine operator with 12 years of mining experience, was

(See Appendix B). West Amarillo installed the cone crusher and a new feed belt between May 2, 2019 and May 5, 2019, and started operating them on May 6, 2019. \xa0The mine encountered material flow problems with the feed belt and feed box from the beginning and made several modifications to try to resolve the issues. \xa0When a stoppage occurred, miners accessed the feed box from above by using a personnel lift, or from the crusher platform below, using a steel pry bar to break the stoppage loose.\xa0\xa0Personnel LiftThe personnel lift is a Snorkel Model # TB-60D7, Serial # MY07112 (See Appendix C). \xa0At the time of the accident, the bottom of the basket was 28 feet above the ground. \xa0The boom was extended to a length of 37 feet, 2 inches, measured from the rear boom pin to the basket pin. \xa0Activity Involved in the AccidentThe investigation team concluded that Ramirez would have positioned the basket directly above the cone crusher to access the feed box.\xa0 The team found a pry bar and belt scraper bushing on the ground approximately 31 feet from the platform.\xa0 In interviews, miners said that in the past, miners used the pry bar to free blockage in the cone crusher feed box.The basket’s torque plate was found to be damaged which caused the basket to move laterally, uncontrolled by the operator.\xa0 The investigation team could not determine if the damage to the torque plate was the result of the bottom of the basket contacting a dowel pin on top of the cone crusher.\xa0 Based on witness accounts, Ramirez was tramming the personnel lift away from the cone crusher structure just prior to the accident.\xa0 Witnesses said the basket appeared to bounce up and down and the victim cartwheeled over the edge of the basket.\xa0 The terrain, speed, damage to the torque plate, and the boom arm extended 37 feet were factors causing the basket to move in an uncontrolled manner.Fall ProtectionWest Amarillo’s policy states that fall protection must be used where required and the user must be properly tied off in all applicable situations.\xa0 Ramirez had been trained on this policy.\xa0 Although the policy did not specifically address tie off procedures in a personnel lift basket, the basket had a label warning equipment operators to wear fall protection at all times. The victim was wearing a fall protection harness and a six foot retractable lanyard, but the lanyard was not tied off at the time of the accident.WeatherThe weather at the time of the accident was clear, with light winds, and a temperature of 51˚F.\xa0 Weather was not a factor in the accident.', 'TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE': 'In October 2018, Richard E. Ramirez received annual refresher training that included the required use of fall protection while working at the nearby Bonita Pit owned and operated by Rogers Group Inc.\xa0 He started working at West Amarillo in December of 2018.\xa0MSHA determined there were no contributory training deficiencies.\xa0', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'The accident investigation team conducted a root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the accident.\xa0 The team identified the following root cause and the mine operator implemented the corresponding corrective action to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not ensure that miners properly wore fall protection where there was a danger of falling.Corrective Action: The mine operator retrained plant operators and plant maintenance personnel on the requirement of wearing fall protection and their “working at heights policy” to include the requirement to tie off while using a personnel lift.', 'CONCLUSION': 'Richard E.

DeBoard, a 38-year- old front-end loader operator with 10 years of mining experience received fatal injuries when he was crushed between a metal support post on a highwall mining machine and a moving push beam.The accident occurred because the mine operator did not identify the location of the accident as a pinch area and did not train the victim to avoid the pinch area.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'The highwall mining machine is owned and operated by South Fork Coal Company, LLC.\xa0 It operates within the Blue Knob Surface Mine. \xa0At the time of the accident, the highwall mining machine was being operated in the Sewell A Seam, located near Rupert, Greenbrier County, West Virginia. \xa0The highwall mining machine produces 350 tons of coal daily on two 12-hour shifts, five days each week and occasionally on Saturdays.The principal officers for the mine at the time of the accident were:Jeff Wilson.......................................................................................... CEO/PresidentArt Hale....................................................................... Senior Director of OperationJosh Sturgill.............................................................................. Mine SuperintendentWade Nichols.............................................................................. Foreman/OperatorKeith Smith.......................................................................................... Safety DirectorThe Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular (E01) safety and health inspection on November 15, 2018. \xa0The non-fatal days lost (NFDL) incident rate for the mine operator in 2018 was 6.59 compared to a national NFDL rate of 0.76 for mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On Thursday, March 7, 2019, the day shift began at 6:00 a.m.\xa0 The hole being mined was completed between 11:30 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., after it was mined to a depth of 560 feet.\xa0 Miners then began removing the underground components of the highwall mining machine. \xa0Adam P. DeBoard parked his front-end loader and came to the highwall mining machine to assist. \xa0DeBoard shoveled mud from the rails, located beside the chain, after each push beam was removed (see Appendix A). \xa0At approximately 1:30 p.m., while standing near the push beam holder (holder) on the side of the machine, DeBoard’s head was caught between the 14th push beam being removed and a stationary metal support post. \xa0Wade Nichols, Foreman/Operator, witnessed DeBoard fall and he immediately pressed the emergency stop button to de-energize the machine.Nichols instructed John Livesay, Fork Loader Operator, to get an emergency medical technician (EMT).\xa0 Livesay traveled just outside the highwall mining machine pit where Josh Bragg, Electrician, and Richie Milam, Maintenance Superintendent/EMT, were servicing a gasoline welder. \xa0Livesay informed Milam that an accident had occurred at the highwall mining machine and he was needed there immediately.\xa0 When Milam arrived at the accident scene, he instructed Mark Chapman, Padman, to get first-aid supplies. \xa0Nichols and Milam positioned DeBoard on his back and assessed his vital signs. \xa0Nichols and Milam did not find a pulse so they began to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\xa0 Livesay notified Josh Sturgill, Mine Superintendent, of the accident. \xa0Sturgill dispatched four additional EMTs from the Blue Knob Surface Mine to the accident scene.\xa0 They were: \xa0Frankie Phares and Ray Kincaid, Truck Drivers; David Brown, Bulldozer Operator; and Markie Holcomb, Front-End Loader Operator.Redi-Care Ambulance Service from Craigsville, West Virginia arrived at the accident scene at 2:02 p.m., and took control of care of DeBoard.\xa0 Redi-Care personnel ruled DeBoard to be in traumatic cardiac arrest and contacted Dr. Jerry Edwards at Medbase.\xa0 Dr. Edwards gave 2:44 p.m. as a time of death and DeBoard was transported to Greenbrier Valley Medical Center in Ronceverte, West Virginia.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On March 7, 2019, at 1:49 p.m., the Department of Labor National Contact Center was notified of the accident.\xa0 At 2:03 p.m., the contact center notified Thomas Dulin, Mine Inspector. \xa0Dulin notified David S. Mandeville, District Manager, that there had been a serious accident at the HWM 61 mine. \xa0At 2:05 p.m., Mandeville notified Franklin Stover, Surface Mine Inspector/Accident Investigator, and Fred Wills, Field Office Supervisor, of the accident.Stover, along with Wills, Mandeville, and Joey Presley, Staff Assistant, traveled to the Summersville Field Office where they met with Kelly Acord, Special Investigations Supervisor/Acting Field Office Supervisor, and Joe Morris, Mine Safety and Health Inspector. \xa0The team traveled to the accident scene and arrived at 5:00 p.m.\xa0 Stover issued a 103(k) order to preserve the accident scene, prevent the destruction of evidence, and ensure the safety of all persons at the mine.\xa0 Stover and Morris gathered preliminary information, examined the accident scene, and took photographs.On Friday, March 8, 2019, Stover, Robert Hatfield, Electrical Supervisor, and Larry Hedrick, Electrical Specialist, traveled to the mine site to perform function testing of the highwall mining machine. \xa0The function testing was conducted in conjunction with representatives from West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST).On March 13, 2019, MSHA and WVOMHST jointly conducted formal interviews at the WVOMHST Office in Oak Hill, West Virginia.\xa0 See Appendix B for a list of persons interviewed and those participating in the accident investigation.On March 20, 2019, Stover, Hedrick, and John Stone, Electrical Specialist, along with Patrick Retzer, Electrical Engineer with MSHA Technical Support, Ron Furrow, Owner and Electrical Engineer with Synergy Global Group, and WVOMHST, traveled to the mine site to download data from the highwall mining machine’s Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), an industrial computer, and two human machine interface (HMI) touchscreen panels.\xa0 They also completed function testing.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Highwall Mining MachineThe highwall mining machine is used to mine holes that are several hundred feet deep, while miners remain on the surface.\xa0 The system involves a cutter module that operates like a continuous mining machine, a push beam that is connected to the cutter module, and additional push beams connected to the first push beam and each other, forming a train of push beams.\xa0 The push beams allow the power head to push the cutter module deeper into the hole being mined.\xa0 The coal that is mined is conveyed, via an auger system in each push beam, to a belt on the surface.After a hole is finished, the push beams and cutter module are removed from the mined hole. \xa0The power head, controlled by the higwall mining machine operator, moves toward the highwall and connects to the push beam to be removed.\xa0 Once connected, the power head retracts, pulling the push beam and the cutter module backward so that it is under the cradle/hoist.\xa0 The cradle/hoist lifts the push beam and places it in the holder.\xa0 A forklift removes the push beam from the holder and places it in a storage area.\xa0 This process continues until all of the push beams and cutter module are removed from the hole that was mined (see Appendix A).The push beams being used are 20 feet 7 inches long and 6 feet 10 inches wide. \xa0They measure 1 foot 8 inches thick and weigh up to 14,000 lbs. \xa0The push beams are loaded and removed by an overhead hydraulic crane/hoist.The highwall mining machine was manufactured in 2008 by Superior Highwall Miners S/N 61 and it was purchased from Commonwealth Mining in March 2016.\xa0 Function testing was conducted on the hydraulic system of the highwall mining machine and nothing was found that contributed to the accident.Functional testing and an inspection were conducted on the electrical system on the highwall mining machine, emergency stop system, and power generator. \xa0No defects were found that contributed to the accident.The Industrial Computer was removed from the highwall mining machine control cab and taken to the National Mine Health and Safety Academy in Beckley, West Virginia, where the data was downloaded by Furrow and Retzer. \xa0The communication ports for the HMIs were damaged, which prevented data storage on the computer since November of 2018.Accident SceneWhen the accident investigation team arrived at the scene the temperature was 27º F.\xa0 Ice was present on the machine handrails.\xa0 The area around the machine was wet and muddy.The highwall mining machine was found with a push beam resting in the holder and the cradle/hoist positioned over top of this beam (see Appendix A).Investigators determined that the victim was standing on a small section (18 inches by 12.5 inches) of metal (travelway) between the ladder leading up to the second level of the machine and the steps that lead to the ground.\xa0 It was common practice for a miner to stand in this small area, to shovel the mud that accumulates on the rails, as the push beams are removed from the mined hole.\xa0 The mud has to be removed after each push beam is removed, to allow the power head to extend and properly connect to the next beam.There was mud present on the walking surfaces of the highwall mining machine from being tracked onto the machine by miners as they got on and off of the machine.\xa0 Some mud and small amounts of coal were on the travelway where the victim was standing at the time of the accident.The small section where the victim was standing was not intended to be a work area because of the proximity of the moving push beams.\xa0 This area was designated for miners to step on momentarily as they got on and off the machine.\xa0 Each push beam was moving approximately 12 to 18 inches in front of the victim as it was raised, moved horizontally, and lowered by the cradle/hoist to the holder. \xa0The Superior Highwall Miners Safety, Operation, and Maintenance Manual, states on page one:Avoid placing yourself in or near pinch areas that exist between moving parts.Investigators determined that the victim was repeatedly standing in a pinch area.\xa0 The foremen and other miners knew the victim was standing in this location and told investigators they believed the area was a safe location for him to wait for the push beam to be moved to the holder.\xa0 During interviews, they stated that it was common for someone to be in this location.\xa0 They stated that this area was a travelway and the support post was between the landing area and the moving push beam.Instead of standing in this location, the victim should have waited on the platform.\xa0 If positioned on the platform, each push beam removed would be moved away from the victim.\xa0 After the push beam was placed in the holder, the victim could have shoveled the mud.\xa0 The victim would have then returned to the platform before the highwall mining machine operator extended the power head to connect to the next beam to be removed.ExaminationAn on-shift examination was conducted by Wade Nichols around 10:00 a.m., on the day of the accident with no hazards recorded.\xa0 Nichols did not see the victim standing in this location during the time he conducted his on-shift examination, but he was aware that the victim stood in this location when he shoveled mud off the push beams.TrainingAdam P. DeBoard began working for the mine operator on May 30, 2017. \xa0He received task training on the highwall mining machine on May 30, 2018.\xa0 This training was conducted by Rickie Milam.\xa0 His last 8 hour Annual Refresher Training was September 22, 2018.The task training provided by the mine operator was not adequate because the training did not address the small area where the victim was standing as a pinch area as stated in the Superior Highwall Miners Safety, Operation, and Maintenance Manual.\xa0 Investigators obtained this manual and learned that the mine operator did not have the section of the manual related to safety.\xa0 Instead, the mine operator only had the section of the manual necessary to maintain the highwall mining machine in operating condition.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management control. \xa0Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corrective actions that were implemented to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause: The task training provided by the mine operator was not adequate because the training did not address areas to avoid in or near pinch areas that exist between moving parts as stated in the Superior Highwall Miners Safety, Operation, and Maintenance Manual.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator provided an 8 hour training class for all miners which covered the Superior Highwall Miners Safety, Operation, and Maintenance Manual and identified the areas to avoid during operation. \xa0Additionally, the mine operator revised their training plan to include a task training check list, and all miners have been task trained in accordance with the newly approved training plan.\n\nRoot Cause: The mine operator did not identify the work location where the accident occurred as a pinch area that needed to be avoided.\nCorrective Action: The mine operator has identified red zone areas that exist when push beams are being installed or removed. \xa0A red zone drawing has been added to the ground control plan with the following requirement, “No persons may enter red zone areas unless the highwall mining machine is idle.”\nThe area where the fatal accident occurred has been brightly painted and posted with warning signs.\xa0 Also, physical barriers have been installed to prevent entry. \xa0The back access steps on the holder side that provide access to this area from the ground have been removed. \xa0A handrail has been installed across the access steps at the second level so no one can enter from the top area. \xa0Cameras were installed with monitors located in the operator’s compartment so the highwall mining machine operator can see if persons enter the red zone areas.\n\n', 'CONCLUSION': 'On Thursday, March 7, 2019, at approximately 1:30 p.m., Adam P. DeBoard, a 38-year- old front-end loader operator with 10 years of mining experience received fatal injuries when he was crushed between a metal support post on a highwall mining machine and a moving push beam.The accident occurred because the mine operator did not identify the location of the accident as a pinch area and did not train the victim to avoid the pinch area.\xa0Approved By:\xa0\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad\xad________________________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0________________David S.

Slone (victim) and William McKamey, two contract survey crew members, arrived at the mine.\xa0 They met with Jack Stump, Owner/Operator, to arrange transportation to the MMU.\xa0 After arriving on the MMU at 9:15 a.m., they met with H. Randall Hensley, Section Foreman, to get details about where to begin setting survey stations, mapping, and taking mining height measurements.\xa0 At this time, the continuous mining machine was loading in the No. 3 entry, so the survey crew began in the No. 6 entry and they planned to work toward the No. 4 entry.After lunch, Richard Lane, Shuttle Car Operator, began operating the No. 4 shuttle car and James Barnett, Roof Bolter, began operating the No. 2 shuttle car.\xa0 Lane drove his shuttle car to the continuous mining machine which was in the left crosscut off the No. 2 entry (see Appendix A).McKamey set the survey instrument in the No. 4 entry and Slone went to the No. 3 entry to take entry height measurements.\xa0 Slone walked to the front of the No. 2 shuttle car, took a mining height measurement, and then walked 20 feet outby in the No. 3 entry to continue taking measurements.\xa0After being loaded with coal, Lane drove his shuttle car toward the feeder.\xa0 At approximately 11:10 a.m., Lane turned into the No. 3 entry and traveled about 10 feet past the inby corner of the pillar and stopped.\xa0 Lane saw that his shuttle car’s trailing cable was caught around the service jack of Barnett’s shuttle car.\xa0 Lane and Barnett exited their shuttle cars and freed the cable.\xa0 Lane continued to the left side of the feeder and Barnett traveled to the continuous mining machine.\xa0After dumping the load into the feeder, Lane noticed that an electrical cable attached to the mine roof over the feeder was down.\xa0 He exited his shuttle car and reattached the cable.\xa0 When he turned around to get back into his shuttle car, he saw Slone lying in the No. 3 entry intersection, adjacent to the feeder.\xa0 Lane went to Slone and found Slone had been run over by Lane’s shuttle car.\xa0 Lane then ran and alerted Barnett of the accident.At approximately 11:15 a.m., Lane went to the mine phone adjacent to the feeder and called Michael Runyon, Owner/Operator, and told him that a miner was seriously injured.\xa0 Next, Lane went to the MMU first aid supplies to retrieve a blanket and a stretcher.\xa0 Barnett ran and notified McKamey, Hensley, and the other miners of the accident.\xa0\xa0Hensley went to the accident scene and realized there was nothing that could be done.\xa0 He instructed the miners to walk to the surface. McKamey came to the accident scene.\xa0 Lane arrived with a blanket and they covered Slone.\xa0 At approximately 11:20 a.m., Lane called outside and told Runyon the victim’s identity and that he was deceased.\xa0 McKamey and Lane walked to the surface.Runyon informed Stump of the accident then called emergency services.\xa0 Stump called Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), District 7, Kentucky Division of Mine Safety (KDMS), and the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center.\xa0MSHA and KDMS personnel arrived at the mine, and traveled to the accident scene with company personnel.\xa0 Slone was placed on a personnel carrier and transported to the surface.\xa0 At 11:49 a.m., the Bell County Ambulance Service arrived at the mine.\xa0 When they arrived, Slone was placed into the ambulance.\xa0 Jason Steele, Bell County Coroner, arrived shortly after 12:30 p.m., and pronounced Slone dead at 12:35 p.m.\xa0', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On January 14, 2019, at 11:20 a.m., Stump notified Samuel R. Creasy, MSHA District 7 Manager, and Billy Allen, KDMS Inspector, to report the accident.\xa0 At 11:25 a.m., Stump notified the DOL National Contact Center (Contact Center) of the accident.\xa0 The Contact Center notified the District 7 Office at 11:40 a.m.\xa0 Creasy assigned Ricky L. Suffridge, Roof Control Specialist/Accident Investigator, as the lead accident investigator.\xa0 Creasy directed Dennis J. Cotton, Assistant District Manager/Technical; Argus Brock, Roof Control Supervisor; William C. Clark, Supervisory Coal Mine Inspector; Ronald D. Caudill, Health Specialist/Accident Investigator; and Sean G. Davenport, Electrical Specialist, to assist in the onsite investigation.\xa0 They traveled to the mine to begin the accident investigation and were assisted by KDMS.When Suffridge arrived at the mine he issued a 103(k) order to protect the safety of persons at the mine.\xa0 Brock, Caudill, and Suffridge along with KDMS personnel conducted informal interviews with miners.Once informal interviews were completed, Creasy, Brock, Clark, Suffridge, Caudill, and Davenport traveled underground with mine officials and KDMS investigators.\xa0 Photographs and measurements of the accident scene were taken.\xa0On January 15, 2019, Deborah B. Combs, Training Specialist with MSHA Educational Field and Small Mine Services, traveled to the mine to review training records of the mine operator and contractor.\xa0On January 15, 2019, formal interviews were conducted jointly by MSHA and KDMS at the MSHA District 7 Office in Barbourville, Kentucky.\xa0 See Appendix B for a list of persons interviewed and those participating in the accident investigation.\xa0', 'DISCUSSION': 'Mine Operator and Coal Owner RelationshipThe contract between the mine operator and the coal owner requires the mining height to be at or below 54 inches.\xa0 To verify compliance, the survey crew periodically measures the mining height on the MMU.\xa0 Measurements are taken at 20 foot intervals in the center of each entry.\xa0 Slone was taking mining height measurements in the No. 3 entry when he was struck by the shuttle car.Accident LocationInvestigators believe the accident occurred at approximately 11:10 a.m., when Lane turned the No. 4 shuttle car into the No. 3 entry at the switch-out location.\xa0 The No. 4 shuttle car is 28 feet long and Slone’s map was found about 30 feet from the inby corner of the pillar (see Appendix C).\xa0 This would indicate that Slone had already been struck when Barnett and Lane exited their cars to free the shuttle car cable.No. 4 Shuttle CarThe No. 4 10SC32 shuttle car, serial number ET16606, was manufactured by Joy Manufacturing Company.\xa0 The last weekly electrical examination on the shuttle car was conducted on January 12, 2019, and the examination record stated that a cable was repaired.The shuttle car was inspected after the accident.\xa0 The brakes functioned properly and no permissibility violations were found, but one of the two headlights was inoperable.\xa0 This light was on the side that the victim was located at the time of the accident.\xa0 Interviews did not reveal that anyone had knowledge that the light was out on the shuttle car.TrainingSlone had over 30 years of experience as an underground miner and surveyor.\xa0 He had been certified in the state of Kentucky as an underground miner and underground mine foreman, and he was certified in gas detection.The mine operator provided hazard training to Slone.\xa0 Slone worked several years as a surveyor in other mines owned by TENNCO INC, and these other mines used the same mining methods and equipment as the Toms Fork Mine.\xa0', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.\xa0Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions which were implemented to prevent a recurrence.\xa0Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not have effective policies, procedures, and controls to protect miners who are on foot from being contacted by moving mobile face equipment.\xa0 The shuttle car operator’s field of vision was greatly reduced due to the size/height of the shuttle car and the low mining height.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 On January 17, 2019, the mine operator submitted, and MSHA approved, a revision to the roof control plan that contains the following safety measures to protect miners travelling on foot on the working section.All persons entering the mine will wear a permissible LED light on the back of their hard hat.\nSurvey crew members will notify the mine operator of the working section to which they will be travelling.\nThe mine operator will notify the miners on the working section.\nThe survey crew will only work on the opposite side of the section of the mining activity.\xa0 If the survey crew is in the belt entry, all mining activities will cease.\nLong reflective markers will be hung in each crosscut from the feeder to the face to show where the survey crew is working.\nWhen the survey crew is finished they will notify the mine operator who will notify the miners on the working section.\n\nOn January 20, 2019, all miners were trained by the mine operator on the provisions of the revised roof control plan.\xa0 Documentation of miners receiving the training was provided.The No. 4 shuttle car has been removed from service until a camera system is installed on the shuttle car.\xa0 The camera system will enable the shuttle car operator to have greater visibility in the area where the victim was located.\xa0 Camera systems were also installed on the other shuttle cars.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not ensure that both headlights on the shuttle car were working properly to illuminate the direction of travel and warn miners traveling on foot.\xa0 One headlight on the dump end of the shuttle car involved in the fatal accident was not operational.\xa0\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator repaired the headlight and implemented a new pre-operational examination policy.\xa0 The new policy requires the lights on shuttle cars to be examined, and repaired if necessary, before operating each shift.', 'CONCLUSION': 'On Monday, January 14, 2019, at approximately 11:10 a.m., Jeffery N.

to the bottom area and help the other miners build a new stopping. \xa0Niehaus proceeded on to the 9 Left mining section.Holland and Ditterline arrived at the bottom area and met with Wright, Hettercheidt, and Wilson to build the stopping. \xa0The area where they were building the new stopping had two 110 volt shop lights that needed to be removed. \xa0To determine the location of the power cable that provided power to the lights, Ditterline traveled outby towards the pneumatic airlock doors located in the crosscut between entry 4 and entry 5 at footage markers 100 and 200 (see Appendix A). \xa0He walked through the inby set of doors and closed them behind him, following the power cable for the lights. \xa0Surveillance video shows that after Ditterline activated the outby set of pneumatic airlock doors, at 3:18 a.m., the indicator lights for the doors began flashing, which means the doors went into fault condition.\xa0 There were no witnesses to what followed, but evidence indicated that Ditterline walked up to the doors, opened the slide access door and the airlock doors opened suddenly, hitting him and pinning him between one of the doors and the concrete barrier. \xa0When the doors opened, Holland, Hettercheidt, Wright and Wilson could hear and feel the air velocity increase at the damaged stopping.Payne was working nearby and walked through the boot wash area to the shaft bottom. \xa0Once at the hoist, Payne noticed the opened airlock doors and a leg extending through the slide access door.\xa0 He ran toward the airlock doors and found Ditterline at 3:22 a.m., pinned behind the left airlock door.\xa0 Ditterline was unresponsive.\xa0 Payne immediately called on the radio for Holland to come to the shaft bottom. \xa0Holland, Wright, Hettercheidt, and Wilson traveled to the shaft bottom to help.\xa0 Holland tried to clear the fault condition at both sets of electronic sensors for the doors. \xa0Once the doors started to close, Wilson and Hettercheidt pulled Ditterline out and laid him on his back.\xa0 Ditterline was still unresponsive. \xa0Wilson, who is an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), and Holland started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\xa0 Hettercheidt assisted with CPR while Wright went to get an automated external defibrillator (AED) from the shop.Niehaus heard Payne call on the radio and traveled from the 9 Left mining section outby towards the bottom area. \xa0Niehaus picked up Michael Welch, Contract Laborer/EMT and they proceeded to the accident scene.\xa0 When Niehaus and Welch arrived, Wilson and Holland were still performing CPR. \xa0An AED was applied to Ditterline, but the diagnostic function of the AED indicated that no shock be administered.\xa0 They placed Ditterline on a backboard and carried him to the hoist for transport to the surface. \xa0Upon arrival on the surface, Harre Ambulance service took over care of Ditterline and transported him to Hamilton Memorial Hospital.James Steven Bowling, Hamilton County Coroner, pronounced Ditterline dead at 4:45 a.m.\xa0 Dr. James Jacoby, Forensic Pathologist, performed an autopsy and stated that Ditterline’s death was due to a cardiomyopathy.\xa0 Coroner Bowling listed cardiomyopathy as the cause of death on the State of Illinois Certificate of Death Worksheet.\xa0 The worksheet also states that the manner of death was “natural.”When a miner’s death is not conclusively determined to be chargeable to the mining industry, MSHA submits the case, including facts and supporting information, to the MSHA Chargeability Review Committee (Review Committee) for a decision.\xa0 The review committee has been in existence since 2008 and has reviewed over 500 cases.\xa0 The Review Committee is currently comprised of the following persons:Reviewing Medical Official, Federal Occupational Health\nAssociate Solicitor for Mine Safety and Health\nDirector of the MSHA Office of Assessments\nDirector of the MSHA Office of Program Evaluation and Information Resources\nDirector of the MSHA Office of Educational Policy and Development (Chair)\nAfter a thorough review of the facts and medical information, the Review Committee found that, “acute stress cardiomyopathy can occur when an individual is exposed to sudden, intense physical or emotional (grief, fear) stress which causes rapid and severe heart muscle weakness. \xa0Acute stress cardiomyopathy can mimic a myocardial infarction (a heart attack) even in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease.”\xa0 “Because 1) Mr. Ditterline was seen on video moments before the door accident in no apparent distress, 2) the door slam was a significantly traumatic event, and 3) the death occurred at the time of the door slam, the Review Committee members [concluded] it is probable that the trauma of the accident triggered acute stress cardiomyopathy.”\xa0 Therefore, the Review Committee stated, “Mr. Ditterline’s death should be charged to the mining industry.”', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On January 5, 2019, at 3:53 a.m., Gary Quertermous, Mine Control, notified the Department of Labor National Contact Center of the accident.\xa0 At 4:08 a.m., the Contact Center notified Robert Bretzman, Supervisory Mine Safety and Health (CMS&H) Inspector.\xa0 Bretzman notified Mary Jo Bishop, Assistant District Manager for Enforcement, of the accident.\xa0 He then directed Brandon Naas, CMS&H Inspector/Accident Investigator, to investigate the accident.\xa0 Bretzman and Naas traveled to the mine where they met Bishop. \xa0Naas issued a 103(k) order to protect the safety of persons at the mine.Investigators obtained preliminary interview statements from persons having knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident.\xa0 The accident investigation team then traveled underground and arrived at the accident scene at approximately 11:20 a.m.\xa0 They took photographs and measurements of the accident scene.MSHA conducted the investigation in cooperation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Mines and Minerals (IDNR), and Hamilton County Coal, LLC personnel. \xa0See Appendix B for a list of those participating in the investigation.On January 7, 2019, David Brown, Training Specialist with MSHA’s Educational Field & Small Mine Services (EFSMS), reviewed training records. \xa0Bretzman and Naas conducted further testing on the pneumatic airlock doors after the stopping had been replaced.On January 8, 2019, Gary Rethage and Mark Kvitkovich, Mechanical Engineers with MSHA Technical Support, traveled to the mine with other investigators to mechanically evaluate the pneumatic airlock doors involved in the accident.On January 17, 2019, the accident investigation team conducted interviews at the IDNR building located in Benton, Illinois (see Appendix B).', 'DISCUSSION': 'Accident SceneThe accident occurred at the set of outby pneumatic airlock doors located on the East Main, Entry 4, between footage markers 0-100, just east of the Main Shaft bottom area (see Appendix A).\xa0 When investigators arrived, the pneumatic doors involved in the accident were in the open position and the slide access door was open.\xa0 Electrical power had been disconnected, locked, and tagged out.Pneumatic Airlock DoorsThe airlock consisted of a set of pneumatic-operated equipment doors (an outby set and an inby set) that allow equipment and personnel access between the mine and the shaft. \xa0The outby airlock doors involved in the accident are located near the bottom of the shaft. The inby set of doors are one crosscut inby through an angled crosscut (see Appendix A).\xa0 The doors were manufactured by Alliance Central Shop.\xa0 The doors are made of metal and each door is approximately 7 feet wide by 7.3 feet high and weighs approximately 550 pounds.\xa0 Both doors opened in the inby direction.\xa0 One door of each set has a small slide access door which measured 29” X 18.5”.Pneumatic Door OverviewThere are two pneumatic systems at this airlock, one for the inby airlock doors, and the other for the outby airlock doors.\xa0 Each pneumatic system is comprised of a compressor, air tank (accumulator), two pneumatic hoses with flow restriction valves in-line, and a pneumatic cylinder. \xa0The cylinder rod connects via a bolted connection to the slide mechanism. \xa0The slide mechanism, which rolls on a steel beam mounted to the roof of the entry, connects to the linkage bars via a pinned connection. \xa0The linkage bars then connect to the doors with a pinned connection (see Appendix C).\xa0The pneumatic cylinder is a double acting cylinder; it has a port on both sides of the cylinder to control motion for extension or retraction. \xa0When the doors are closed, the cylinder rod is in the extended position. \xa0The pneumatic air pressure is located on the piston side of the cylinder to keep the cylinder rod extended and the doors closed, while the air in the other side vents to the atmosphere. \xa0The air venting to atmosphere works as a dampener to slow the pressurized side. \xa0This allows the doors to open or close in a controlled manner. \xa0The solenoids reverse when the doors go into the open status, pressurizing the rod side of the cylinder to retract the cylinder rod and venting the air on the piston side of the cylinder rod.An electronic system controls the pneumatic components. \xa0This system utilizes an Allen Bradley MicroLogix 1400 Model, programmable logic controller (PLC), which controls the solenoid valves, lights, and audible alarms. \xa0There are limit switches above the slider mechanism that sense the position of the cylinder rod. \xa0The limit switches send a signal to the logic controller. \xa0An electronic signal opens a solenoid and closes the other solenoid when the beam of the photo sensors is broken. \xa0This also triggers the lights and audible alarms for the direction of travel.\xa0The photo sensor has two sides: \xa0open or close. \xa0The open sensor is marked with green and the close sensor is marked with red. \xa0The beam generator generates a beam; the beam reflects back to a sensor in the beam generator. \xa0When the beam is broken, the PLC opens or closes the doors. \xa0The PLC also activates the lights and audible alarms. \xa0Miners operate the doors by placing their hand into the appropriate side of the photo sensor mount located near the doors (see Appendix D).The doors have three statuses: \xa0closed, open and fault. \xa0The fault condition activates when the doors do not reach the limit switch in the desired direction of travel within 35 seconds. \xa0The pneumatics stay pressurized in the desired direction of travel while the air in the other side of the cylinder has had time to completely vent to the atmosphere. \xa0The fault clears by interrupting the beam on both the open and close sides of the photo sensor mount. \xa0The lights continue to flash in the fault condition, but the alarm stops after 35 seconds.Mechanical Engineers from MSHA Technical Support observed the outby doors and its components on January 8, 2019. \xa0They evaluated the components of the pneumatic system for damage. \xa0The investigators did not observe damage on any component of the system, including the pneumatic cylinder, cylinder rod, linkages, hoses, valves, air tank (accumulator), or door. \xa0The electronic controls appeared to be functioning properly as the door functioned as designed when tested.\xa0 Investigators did not observe damaged components in the pneumatic system or mechanical components. \xa0The pneumatic system and all mechanical components operated as designed.Effects of Ventilation Pressures on the Pneumatic DoorsThe mine repaired the damaged stopping prior to the January 8 investigation to correct the ventilation. \xa0The investigators observed that the outby doors opened normally with the corrected ventilation. \xa0However, the inby doors would not open without assistance due to the ventilation change caused by the damaged stopping. \xa0When mine personnel pushed on the inby doors, they opened in an uncontrolled rapid manner in the same way the outby doors opened, which caused the fatal injury.ReenactmentIn an attempt to recreate a fault condition on the outby doors, the investigators opened the sliding door on one of the inby doors to increase pressure and ventilation in the airlock.\xa0 The investigators measured the velocity of the air in the airlock with an anemometer. \xa0The air quantity was approximately 13,000 cubic feet per minute (cfm). \xa0Before repairs were made to the damaged stopping, the quantity of the air in the airlock had been measured at approximately 36,000 cfm. \xa0Despite the reduced ventilation pressure, the outby doors went into the fault condition and did not open without assistance.The system was set to the fault condition again to evaluate what would happen when the sliding door in one of the outby doors was opened. \xa0After a few seconds, the outby doors opened in an uncontrolled rapid manner. \xa0This test demonstrated the scenario that evidence indicates occurred at the time of the accident.\xa0Mine personnel placed pressure gauges on both ports of the outby door cylinder to monitor pressures while the door was being tested.\xa0 The air tank maintained a pressure of 140 pounds per square inch (psi).\xa0 Testing was then performed on the cylinder while the door was in a fault condition.\xa0 The rod side of the cylinder remained within its designed operating pressures of 105 to 120 psi.\xa0 The piston side of the cylinder went to zero which means that there was no dampening effect to allow the doors to open in a controlled manner after the slide access door was open.\xa0 Testing showed investigators that the pneumatic system operated as designed, that there were no overpressures or other problems solely with the pneumatic system, and that the problem with the doors was created by the high air pressure environment.Conclusions from TestingThe increased ventilation pressure due to the damaged stopping was outside the designed operating parameters for this system. \xa0At the time of the accident, the airlock door system operated within its designed logic parameters and entered a fault condition when the door would not open. \xa0When the victim opened the sliding door on the outby door, the ventilation pressure moved toward equilibrium. \xa0The pneumatic air pressure on the rod side of the cylinder (pushing open the door) was now greater than the force provided by the ventilation pressure (holding the door closed). \xa0The residual air pressure on the piston side of the cylinder that normally dampens this movement had completely vented to the atmosphere; this allowed the outby door to open in an uncontrolled rapid manner.Rethage and Technical Support’s Mechanical Engineering Division calculated the kinetic energy and the energy equivalency of the pneumatic airlock door when it impacted Ditterline.\xa0 They determined that the door hit Ditterline with the equivalent energy of a 550 pound mass moving at approximately 4.5 miles per hour.\xa0 Ditterline was pinned between the door and the concrete barrier, with the door continually applying a force of 550 pounds until the door was moved away from him and closed.\xa0 Video surveillance established that the outby airlock doors went into fault mode at 3:18 a.m., and the door was removed from Ditterline at 3:22 a.m.Problems with the Pneumatic Airlock DoorsInvestigators discovered through interviews and discussions with miners that the operation of the airlock doors was problematic and known to miners.\xa0 Investigators also learned through the discussions with miners that the mine operator attempted to overcome the high mine ventilation pressure by installing an air compressor near the shaft bottom, in line with the air supply from the surface, to ensure air was always available for the airlock doors.\xa0 This did not correct the problem.\xa0 After installing the compressor, the airlock doors would open easier. \xa0However, the slide access door still had to be opened for the airlock doors to operate, and the airlock doors would open more violently.\xa0 Investigators also discovered that on the shift prior to the accident, a miner was nearly struck by the same set of airlock doors as the victim.\xa0 However, mine management was not made aware of this incident.Investigators reviewed the mine surveillance video from earlier in the shift prior to the accident.\xa0 This video shows Payne, who normally works in this area of the mine and is very familiar with these airlock doors, open the inby set of airlock doors and drive his megatrack pushing a supply trailer into the airlock.\xa0 After closing the inby set, the video shows he activated the photo sensor to open the outby airlock doors involved in the accident.\xa0 Although Payne cannot be seen on the video inside the airlock, the lights on the travelway indicate the airlock doors went into fault condition twice and did not open.\xa0 Payne can be seen walking back through the inby set of airlock doors and around to the shaft bottom side of the outby set of doors. \xa0By approaching the outby set of airlock doors from this side, he could open them standing out of the swing path while avoiding the sudden movement.ExaminationsInvestigators determined through interviews that the mine operator did not regularly conduct pre-shift examinations for supply travelways between the airlock doors.\xa0 An adequate preshift examination may have identified the operational issues associated with the doors.Training and ExperienceDitterline had 28 years of total underground mining experience, with 5 weeks and 5 days as a contract laborer for Madisonville Mining, LLC at Hamilton County Coal.\xa0 He had mine manager and mine examiner certifications from the State of Illinois. \xa0He received experienced miner training on November 26, 2018.\xa0 He had not received task training with regard to the hazards associated with the pneumatic airlock doors in fault condition.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \xa0The accident investigation team identified root causes that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions that were implemented to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\xa0 The pneumatic airlock doors were not designed and maintained to operate safely in the high mine ventilation pressure area near the shaft bottom.\xa0 A damaged permanent ventilation stopping, which isolated the area between the airlock doors from the intake air course, caused the high mine ventilation pressure on the outby airlock doors.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator replaced the pneumatic system with a hydraulic system on the airlock doors that is capable of safely operating the doors in the high mine ventilation pressure area near the shaft bottom.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator had not established safe work procedures when miners encountered fault conditions on the pneumatic airlock doors.\nCorrective Action: \xa0The mine operator developed and implemented safe work procedures to be followed in the event of fault conditions on pneumatic and hydraulic airlock doors.\xa0 All miners were trained in these work procedures.Root Cause: \xa0The mine operator did not task train the victim with regard to the hazards associated with the pneumatic airlock doors in fault condition.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 Miners have received task training on the safe operating procedures for the hydraulic equipment doors. \xa0Also, the hydraulic equipment door operation instructions have become part of the mine operator’s Standardized Traffic Rules.', 'CONCLUSION': 'On Saturday, January 5, 2019, at approximately 3:20 a.m., John D. Ditterline, a 55 year-old contract laborer, died when he was pinned between a pneumatic airlock door and a concrete barrier.\xa0 The victim was tracing a power cable through the area of the airlock doors and he had passed through an inby set of airlock doors.\xa0 When he tried to open the outby set of airlock doors, they failed to open.\xa0 Evidence indicates that he then opened a small sliding access door at the bottom of one of the outby airlock doors.\xa0 The opening of the sliding door lowered the air pressure and caused the outby airlock doors to suddenly spring open, pinning the victim between one of the outby airlock doors and a concrete barrier.The accident occurred because the mine operator did not design and maintain the pneumatic airlock doors to operate safely in the high air pressure environment where they were located, and did not establish safe work procedures for when the doors did not operate properly.\xa0 A damaged, permanent ventilation stopping, isolating the area between the airlock doors from the intake air course, created additional pressure causing the doors to not open properly.\xa0Approved By:\xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0Ronald W.

Brown began his shift on December 29, 2018, at approximately 6:00 p.m. Ronald Coleman, Night Shift Supervisor, conducted a safety meeting with the night shift workcrew: Brown; Gregory Raley, Plant Operator; Mathew Rumley, Plant Operator; and Steven Strasser, Plant Operator. \xa0Employees rotated positions every three to four hours during the shift, in accordance with Coalview’s procedures. \xa0Brown operated the suction dredge, Raley went to the control room, and Rumley and Strasser were the groundsmen for the first rotation.\xa0\xa0At approximately 6:30 p.m., after the safety meeting, Brown drove out to the impoundment, referred to as pond 3C (see Appendix A), to begin operating the suction dredge and relieve William Bachman, Plant Operator. \xa0Bachman stated in his interview that when Brown relieved him, he told Brown that the walking surface of the starboard side of the stern pontoon was around one inch below the water surface. \xa0Bachman released some tension on the stern-line and brought the pontoon up about four inches above the water line. \xa0Bachman then left the suction dredge, but returned when he discovered that he left his portable radio. \xa0Brown handed Bachman the radio and Bachman left the suction dredge.Approximately 6:53 p.m., Raley radioed Brown to relay flow information, and Brown told Raley that he was going to see clear water, because he was going to pump out the pontoon.\xa0 The investigators found a portable bilge pump in the starboard compartment of the stern pontoon. (See Appendix B) \xa0Based on the location of the portable pump, the investigators concluded that Brown intended to pump the stern pontoon.At approximately 7:14 p.m., Raley noticed that the output from the suction dredge had dropped off. He attempted to radio Brown, but received no response. At that time, Rumley and Strasser were checking a light plant near the power box for the suction dredge, Rumley noticed that the power indicator lights were not on. Strasser radioed Raley alerting him that there was no power to the dredge and that he could not see the dredge. At this time, Rumley traveled by boat to check on the dredge.When Rumley reached the location of the dredge, he found it had sunk with only the A-frame protruding out of the water. Rumley radioed Coleman, who notified Brian Casperson, Trans Alta’s Shift Supervisor, and asked him to call for help. Coleman and Strasser also joined in the search for Brown by boat.Casperson called for emergency responders at 7:54 p.m.\xa0 The fire department, law enforcement and emergency medical services arrived and continued to search for Brown.\xa0 At approximately 10:28 p.m., rescuers halted search efforts because of the weather and poor visibility.\xa0 The search resumed during the daylight hours on December 30, 2018. \xa0Law enforcement officers called rescue divers from Thurston County, Washington.\xa0 The rescue divers located Brown, who was wearing a flotation device, at approximately 2:35 p.m. in the dredge operator’s compartment.\xa0 The interviews with the divers revealed that they had a difficult time opening the dredge operator’s compartment door.\xa0 They recovered the victim and turned him over to the Lewis County Coroner for an autopsy.\xa0 The medical examiner determined that the cause of death was from drowning.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On December 29, 2018, at 7:50 p.m., Roger Fish, Coalview’s President, contacted the Department of Labor’s National Contact Center (DOLNCC), to notify MSHA that a miner was unaccounted for and possibly trapped in a suction dredge. \xa0DOLNCC notified Melvin Palmer, MSHA’s Kent Field Office Supervisory Inspector, of the accident at 8:05 p.m. Palmer dispatched John Uriona, MSHA Inspector, to the mine and the investigation started the next day. \xa0Upon arrival, Uriona issued an order under the Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to secure the scene and ensure the safety of the miners.MSHA’s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident site, interviewed miners, and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident.\xa0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and contractors.\xa0 See Appendix C for persons participating in the investigation.Coalview took over two months to contract Global Diving and Salvage Inc., a maritime salvage company to recover the suction dredge. \xa0The recovery process began on March 4, 2019. \xa0They recovered the suction dredge and brought it to a prepared examination area on April 11, 2019.\xa0 The recovery was hampered by the dredge being stuck in the several feet of coal slurry.Johnathan Hall, MSHA’s Approval and Certification Center Mechanical Engineer, arrived on April 16, 2019, to begin assessment of the condition of the suction dredge. \xa0Jordan Rose and Robert Bates, MSHA’s Pittsburgh Safety and Health Technology Center Electrical Engineers arrived on April 30, 2019, to assess the electrical distribution system.', 'DISCUSSION': ""Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred in a coal refuse impoundment identified as pond 3C.\xa0 The maximum depth of the pond is approximately 30 feet and investigators estimate the depth where the dredge sank was 21 feet.\xa0Suction DredgeInvestigators were unable to determine the manufacturer and the year of manufacture of the suction dredge.\xa0 There was a weld bead on the starboard side of the center hull section with the letters and numbers WB133MIF0493.\xa0 This was the only identification marking on the suction dredge, and investigators were not able to track it or find any information on the dredge searching various databases.Coalview purchased the suction dredge in 2015, from Dredge Central of Goodlettsville, Tennessee. \xa0It is approximately 72 feet long and 17 feet wide. \xa0It consists of four sections with flotation: the starboard pontoon; the port pontoon; the stern pontoon; and the center hull (See Appendices B and D).\xa0 The starboard and port pontoons had four sealed compartments each.\xa0 The stern pontoon had two sealed compartments.\xa0 The center hull does not seal. \xa0Other major components include the cutter head assembly, the A-frame that supports the cutter head, and the dredge operator’s compartment.When Coalview purchased the suction dredge, it was equipped with a diesel engine.\xa0 At Coalview’s request, Dredge Central replaced the diesel engine with four electric motors.\xa0 Dredge Central also added the stern pontoon, the electrical transformer on top of the stern pontoon, and the Motor Control Center (MCC) on top of the stern end of the center hull. \xa0Water was added to the first compartment on the starboard side pontoon to counter-balance the electrical transformer that was added to the portside stern pontoon when the suction dredge was modified from a diesel suction dredge, to an electrical suction dredge.\xa0Coalview runs a 7200 volt power cable from the shore to the electrical transformer to provide power to the suction dredge.Suction Dredge OperationThe suction dredge does not have conventional vessel controls or a propeller.\xa0 Three winches control the suction dredge location by reeling in or spooling out cables attached to anchor points on the shore.\xa0 The stern winch is located at approximately the center of the stern pontoon, in an elevated position, and next to the transformer.\xa0 The front starboard and port winches are mounted at the front of the dredge operator’s compartment.The suction dredge recovers coal slurry from the bottom of the impoundment.\xa0 The slurry is a mixture of water, coal fines, rock, and clay or dirt. \xa0The cutting head is lowered into the water from the A frame by a winch. \xa0The weight of the cutter head assembly caused the suction dredge trim to change.\xa0 As the cutter head assembly lifts up, the bow (forward part of the hull) of the suction dredge lowers in the water and as the cutter head assembly lowers, the bow of the suction dredge lifts up and the stern of the suction dredge lowers into the water.\xa0 Based on statements made during investigation interviews, investigators learned that portions of the deck were underwater, at times, during normal operation.A large slurry pump, powered by a 500 horsepower electric motor, pulls the material loosened by the cutting head into the inlet pipe. \xa0The slurry pump pushes the slurry into a discharge pipe on the suction dredge.Suction Dredge ConditionPontoons & Compartments:Investigators conducted tests for leaks on nine of the ten pontoon compartments. \xa0Damage sustained to the port side of the stern pontoon during recovery of the suction dredge made it impossible to test the port side compartment on the stern pontoon.\xa0 The rubber seals on the ten hatch covers for the pontoon compartments were hardened and flat along the outer edges, preventing the hatches from getting a positive seal. Prior to testing, investigators removed a mixture of mud, coal slurry, rust, and water from each compartment. \xa0Investigators filled the nine undamaged pontoon compartments with water and documented any leaks.Investigators determined that the first and fourth compartments on the starboard pontoon leaked. \xa0A pipe with a valve that did not fully close allowed water to flow between the third and fourth compartments. \xa0Pontoons should be kept independent of each other in case if one pontoon fails the other pontoons would continue to float.The number four compartment of the starboard pontoon had an area of deterioration on its bottom outside weld seam that measured 31 inches long.\xa0 Within that 31 inches of affected area, there were two, approximately 6.5 inches long cracks, and an approximately 0.5 inch hole located between the cracks. \xa0The hatch that secured the starboard compartment on the stern pontoon was missing. \xa0Brown appears to have been pumping water from the starboard compartment using a portable electric sump pump, as investigators found the pump with electrical cord and discharge hose here.\xa0 Testing did not reveal any leaks in this compartment. \xa0The other nine hatches were in place and secured.\xa0Bilge Pumps:Two of the three built-in, float-equipped bilge pumps in the center hull were missing. \xa0The port and starboard bilge pumps on the bow end of the hull had been removed. \xa0The third portside aft bilge pump was not functional. \xa0Appendix B shows the three pumps with labels PF (Pump Forward), PL (Pump Left), and PR (Pump Right).Investigators identified a hose that connected the sump pump in the stern end of the hull to its outlet pipe that discharges outside of the hull and into the pond. \xa0This pipe penetrated the stern end of the center hull 43 inches above the bottom. \xa0Neither the pipe, the hose, nor the pump included a check valve.Equipment Changes:Coalview replaced the slurry pump that came with the suction dredge with a larger, heavier model. \xa0This larger pump required reinforcement of the floor of the center hull to support it. \xa0Coalview also replaced electric motors on the suction dredge multiple times after the hull had taken on enough water to submerge and destroy them.\xa0 These changes added thousands of pounds of additional weight to the suction dredge. \xa0Dredge Operator’s Compartment Doors:The dredge operator’s compartment had a metal door with windows on the starboard and port side. \xa0The starboard door did not line up properly with the doorframe and the plunger of the doorknob did not engage the doorframe. \xa0Opening and closing the starboard door required significant force. \xa0On many occasions during the investigation, investigators had to make multiple attempts to open the starboard door to the dredge operator’s compartment.\xa0 The port side door lined up with the doorframe and the plunger of the knob engaged with the doorframe. \xa0However, the plunger was badly worn and came apart during the investigation, and mine personnel reported that both doors routinely stuck closed.\xa0 Coalview reportedly replaced the entire doorknob assembly about once a year. \xa0There was a new replacement assembly on the floor of the dredge operator’s compartment, unopened in the original packaging.Electrical:Based on the information gathered during the investigation and the data recorded by Trans Alta, an electrical fault occurred in the 7200 volt dredge circuit at 7:19 p.m. on the day of the accident. The fault was of sufficient magnitude and duration to cause the oil blast circuit breaker in Substation 6 to trip. \xa0Vacuum circuit breaker 14, which is located in the switch house near the shore of the settling pond, did not trip during the event because the shunt trip mechanism had been disassembled.MSHA Mine Electrical Systems Division examined three short segments of Anaconda Brand 1/0 AWG, 8 KV, portable cable that supplied power to the dredge.\xa0 Their examination found the outer jacket of these segments was damaged, and this damage had allowed water to enter into the interior of the cable.\xa0 The damage extended into the insulation of one of the phases, but did not penetrate all the way to the copper conductor.\xa0Daily InspectionsThe hazardous conditions that were found on the dredge, after it was recovered, were obvious and widespread.\xa0 Also, management was aware of many of these conditions found on the dredge and continued to operate the dredge by using bilge pumps to remove water from the pontoons and hull. \xa0Investigators discovered an electronic file that contained hazardous conditions observed during the mine operator’s daily inspections.\xa0 However, many of these hazardous conditions were not recorded in the preshift/on-shift daily report record book.WeatherThe weather conditions near the time of the accident were rainy and windy, with a temperature in the mid 40’s. \xa0The suction dredge operators from prior shifts reported “brown caps”, or large waves in the pond.\xa0Training and ExperienceCaleb J. Brown had 21 weeks of experience as a plant operator, all of which were at this mine. \xa0On March 20, 2019, Heather Smith, MSHA’s Educational Field and Small Mine Services Training Specialist, traveled to the mine and conducted an in-depth review of the mine operator's training records.\xa0 The training records for Mr. Brown were in compliance with 30 CFR."", 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'The accident investigation team conducted a root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the accident.\xa0 The team identified the following root causes and corresponding corrective actions implemented to prevent a recurrence of the accident.Root Cause: Mine management allowed several unsafe conditions to exist on the dredge.\xa0 There were leaks in several compartments of the starboard pontoon. \xa0Efforts to correct the leaks were unsuccessful, forcing miners to pump the pontoons and hull on a regular basis. \xa0The combination of the water already in the starboard pontoon and hull, water entering through the open stern hatch and the stormy weather caused the dredge to sink.Corrective Action: The dredge has been taken out of service and is being evaluated for salvage / scrap value. The operator has submitted a new operating plan, which must be approved by the District Manager before any mining activities can resume.\xa0Root Cause:\xa0 Mine management did not correct hazards found during examinations.Corrective Action: The dredge has been taken out of service and is being evaluated for salvage / scrap value. The operator has submitted a new operating plan, which must be approved by the District Manager before any mining activities can resume.', 'CONCLUSION': 'Caleb J. Brown drowned after the suction dredge he was operating sank in an impoundment pond.\xa0 The accident occurred because: the mine contractor did not have sufficient policies or procedures to maintain the suction dredge’s pontoons, bilge pumps, and dredge operator’s compartment doors to safely conduct mining operations; and the mine contractor conducted inadequate on shift examinations and took no action to correct hazardous conditions.\xa0\xa0\xa0Approved: ____________________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Date: _________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Donald R.

Mine ForemanVincent Pelesky ……………………………………………………... Safety SupervisorPrior to the accident, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular (E01) safety and health inspection on September 27, 2018. \xa0The non-fatal days lost (NFDL) incident rate for the mine in 2017 was 2.67 compared to a National NFDL rate of 3.70 for mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On Thursday, December 20, 2018, the eleven miners from the MMU 002 production crew gathered at the section at approximately 11:50 p.m.\xa0At about 12:20 a.m., after repairing the section conveyor belt, the crew began mining coal.\xa0 Mike Laue operated the CMM, Darrell Lane operated No. 2 MBC directly behind, and Nevin Hostetter (victim) operated No. 1 MBC behind that. \xa0The MBCs were connected by a bridge conveyor and had to be moved in tandem. \xa0A second bridge conveyor connected the No. 1 MBC to the section conveyor belt.\xa0 The MBCs did not have operator compartments; each one was operated separately using a remote control transmitter with a range of about 100 feet.After several hours of mining operations, Laue began to position the CMM to mine the No. 5 entry. \xa0Lane and Hostetter followed with the mobile bridge system, then stopped for a few minutes while Laue positioned the CMM cable.At this time, the MBC operated by Darrell Lane was approximately 20 feet outby the back of the CMM. The MBC operated by Hostetter (victim) was outby the corner of the intersection in the No. 3 entry, between the conveyor belt and the left coal rib.\xa0 Hostetter was located on the outby corner of the intersection in the No. 3 entry (see Appendix A).When Laue finished positioning the CMM cable, Lane used his cap light to signal to Hostetter that it was time to move again.\xa0 Lane began to tram the MBC forward but heard a loud metallic noise and was unable to continue forward.\xa0 Lane yelled for Hostetter and shut off his machine. \xa0He yelled again and received no response.\xa0 Lane could not see Hostetter, so he crawled back and saw him pinned between the No. 1 bridge conveyor frame and the coal rib.\xa0 Lane trammed the No. 2 MBC back, and Hostetter fell to the mine floor.\xa0 Lane pushed the panic button on the remote control transmitter to de-energize both MBCs, and yelled for Laue and Brian Francisco, Section Foreman and Emergency Medical Technician (EMT).Laue came from the CMM to the accident scene.\xa0 Francisco was putting mining sights up in the No. 3 entry with Mike Scherer, Scoop Operator, when they both heard yelling and went to the accident scene.\xa0 Other miners also heard yelling and went to the accident scene.\xa0 Francisco assessed Hostetter’s vitals and found no pulse or breathing.\xa0 Francisco told the miners at the scene to call outside and tell Ernie Shaulis, Outside Attendant, to call 911 and then bring the first aid supplies and personnel carrier to the scene.\xa0 Both Francisco and Scherer called Andrew Pianetti, Mine Examiner and EMT, who was working outby the section and told him to come to the section.Shaulis called 911 at 3:03 a.m. and then called Vincent Pelesky, Safety Supervisor, and Bradley Russian, Pennsylvania Bureau of Mine Safety (PA BMS) Inspector.\xa0 Shaulis was contacted again from the miners underground and told to call for a helicopter.\xa0 He called for a helicopter and then met the ambulance to show them where to land the helicopter.Hostetter was placed on the personnel carrier, which Laue drove to the surface while Pianetti and Scherer attempted to provide care to Hostetter.\xa0 Pianetti and Scherer did not detect vital signs and were unable to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation because of the trauma sustained by the victim.\xa0 When they arrived on the surface, both the Boswell Volunteer Fire Department and the Somerset ambulance services were waiting for them in the pit.\xa0 The attendants from the ambulance service made the decision not to treat the victim any further.\xa0 He was placed into an ambulance and transported to the helicopter landing area, where he was pronounced dead at 3:33 a.m. by Wallace Miller, Somerset County Coroner, via telephone.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On December 20, 2018, at 3:48 a.m., Vincent Pelesky, Safety Supervisor for the North Fork mine, notified the Department of Labor National Contact Center (DOL-NCC) of the accident.\xa0 The DOL-NCC notified Randall Caramellino, MSHA District 2 Staff Assistant, at 4:01 a.m.\xa0 Caramellino contacted Dennis Zeanchock, MSHA Johnstown Field Office Supervisor, at approximately 4:17 a.m.\xa0 Zeanchock directed Gregory Bodenschatz, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector (CMI), and Richard Gindlesperger, CMI/Accident Investigator, to begin the accident investigation.\xa0 Bodenschatz arrived at the mine at 5:20 a.m. and issued a 103(k) order to preserve the accident scene, prevent the destruction of evidence, and ensure the safety of all persons in the mine.MSHA personnel conducted the accident investigation in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mine Safety (PA BMS) and mine management.\xa0 The investigation team conducted interviews with miners.\xa0 See Appendix B for a list of persons interviewed and those participating in the accident investigation.The investigation team traveled underground and took pictures and measurements of the accident scene.\xa0 The MBC system safety controls were tested on both MBCs and the remote control transmitters.\xa0 During these preliminary tests investigators found no deficiencies.On December 21, 2018, Gindlesperger, Bodenschatz, along with representatives of PA BMS, and members of mine management traveled underground to conduct further testing of the safety functions on the MBCs and remote control transmitters.\xa0 They conducted a re-creation of the accident and collected additional photos and measurements.\xa0 The MBCs and the remote control transmitters functioned as designed during this testing.On December 26, 2018, Gindlesperger, Bodenschatz, Mark Gindlesperger, Deep Mine Inspector Supervisor, PA BMS, and members of mine management traveled underground to conduct function tests on the No. 1 MBC.\xa0 The remote control transmitters for the No. 1 and No. 2 MBCs were taken into custody by MSHA for additional testing.On January 25, 2019, Structured Mining Systems Inc., (dba Cervis Inc.) performed functionality testing on the remote control transmitters at the Cervis facility in Cranberry, Pa.\xa0 Both remote control transmitters functioned as designed.\xa0 Investigators determined that both transmitters had several discrepancies when they were compared to the approval documentation on file at the MSHA Approval and Certification Center.\xa0 The discrepancies did not contribute to the fatal accident.\xa0 MSHA issued two non-contributory citations to Cervis Inc., one for each transmitter.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Accident SceneThe accident occurred 5 feet inby station spad 8487, in the No. 3 entry intersection of the 5 Right Room D section.\xa0 The victim was on the right outby corner of the intersection in the No. 3 entry and the No. 1 MBC was outby the corner of the intersection in the No. 3 entry, between the conveyor belt and the left coal rib (see Appendix A).\xa0 The area was mined 47 inches high.\xa0 The roof had permanent roof support installed, and no hazardous conditions were observed in the roof and ribs in the area.\xa0 The mine roof, ribs, and bottom were dry.\xa0When the investigators arrived on the scene, the equipment was in the location that miners described during interviews. \xa0Imprints of the MBC tracks, found on mine floor, were undisturbed and used to determine the location of the equipment at the time of the accident.Continuous Haulage Mining SystemThe continuous haulage mining system involved in the accident was a “detached system,” meaning that the MBCs and bridge conveyors were not physically attached to the CMM.\xa0 In addition, the MBCs did not have operator compartments and were remotely controlled.\xa0 The continuous haulage system was a Fairchild[1], Model - Hi-Cap XL, Serial Number (SN) MBC 13-182, MSHA approval number 2G-3326A-7.\xa0 The No. 2 (inby) MBC collects the mined coal from the rear of the CMM.\xa0 A bridge conveyor connects the No. 2 MBC to the No. 1 (outby) MBC and another bridge conveyor connects the No. 1 MBC to the section conveyor belt (see Appendix A).The MBCs are operated separately by each MBC operator with a remote control transmitter from any location within radio frequency range, which can exceed 100 feet.\xa0 The remote control transmitters used to control the MBCs were Structured Mining Systems Inc., remote control Model Number TX-H107. \xa0Remote control transmitter SN 124 was used to operate the No. 1 MBC and remote control transmitter SN 129 was used to operate the No. 2 MBC.Each remote control transmitter has an “inactivity shutdown” function that shuts down the transmitter and the MBC if no switch on the transmitter is actuated within a set time.\xa0 After the accident, the inactivity shutdown time was changed from 1 hour (set by the manufacturer) to 1 minute.CommunicationInvestigators learned that Lane commonly signaled with his cap lamp to inform Hostetter of his intentions to move forward or backward.\xa0 This method of communication is unreliable because the view may be blocked and there is no confirmation that the MBC operator received or understood the signal.\xa0 A positive means of verbal communication by radio or pager helps prevent miscommunication.Training and ExperienceHostetter had a total of 5 years, 21 weeks, and 4 days of underground mining experience, with 4 years and 26 weeks of experience as a MBC operator. \xa0All of his experience was at the North Fork mine. \xa0Hostetter had a certificate of qualification as a miner and a machine operator’s certificate from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.On July 22, 2013, and on August 9, 2013, Hostetter was trained in the task of a continuous haulage operator on a Caterpillar (CAT) MBC.\xa0 This training was conducted prior to the arrival of the Fairchild MBCs in January of 2014.\xa0 Training records show that he did not receive additional training after the new system arrived.The new system differed from the CAT MBC being used earlier in that it has no attached operator’s compartment or machine mounted controls, is not attached to the CMM, and is operated by remote control.\xa0 Given the differences between the two MBC systems, the mine operator should have revised the training plan to address the differences, including any potential differences in hazards.\xa0 Such a revision should have emphasized red zones and safe locations for the operators.Hostetter operated the Fairchild MBC for approximately 5 years before the accident and miners who were interviewed stated that he was proficient. \xa0Hostetter also performed task training for other Fairchild MBC operators.\xa0 Therefore, investigators do not believe inadequate task training was a contributing factor to the fatal accident.\xa0 However, MSHA issued a noncontributing citation for a violation of 48.7(a)(3) because the victim was not tasked trained before he started operating the Fairchild MBC in 2014.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that are correctible through reasonable management controls.\xa0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective action which was implemented to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\xa0 The operator did not provide adequate means of protection against crushing injuries to miners that operate the Fairchild MBC system.\n\xa0Corrective Action:A proximity detection system is being installed on the MBC involved in the fatal accident.\xa0 The other MBCs will be provided with either a proximity detection system or a substantially constructed deck.\n\t\xa0\nAll decks on MBCs shall be substantially constructed to protect MBC operators from crushing injuries.\xa0 All decks shall be provided with an operator-in-position safety device.\xa0 This device will be installed to deactivate the tram motors of all MBCs when an MBC operator exits the compartment.\xa0 The switch shall prevent restarting the motor of any MBC until the operator returns in position.\xa0 This safety device shall be functional when repositioning during the mining cycle or tramming the MBC from one place to another.\n\t\xa0\nThe mine operator will perform and document a pre-operational check which includes checking each operator-in-position switch (if an operator’s deck is installed), panic bar, and proximity detection system (if operated by remote control) prior to putting the equipment into service each shift.\xa0 All deficiencies found that affect safety must be corrected before any MBC is put into service.\xa0 The pre-operational checks, deficiencies found, and corrective actions shall be documented in the foreman’s note pad and made available to MSHA upon request and recorded in a book.\xa0 The record book of the pre-operational checks shall be promptly dated and signed.\xa0 The record book will be retained at a surface location at the mine for at least one year and shall be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners.\n\t\xa0\nAll MBCs shall be provided with an audible alarm system that warns machine operators and other miners in the vicinity at least 3 seconds in advance that the machines are energized and able to move.\xa0 Cap lamp signals will not be an acceptable means of warning.\n\t\xa0\nThe inactivity shutdown feature on the remote control of each MBC will be reduced to a maximum of one minute.\xa0 No miner shall operate more than one remote control box at the same time.\n\t\xa0\nAll MBC operators have been provided with a stand-alone permissible two-way voice communications system.\xa0 Such communication system shall be either hardwired on the machine or a wireless device worn by the machine operators.\xa0 If a wireless device is used, a separate radio frequency specified for such use only shall be provided.\xa0 MBC operators must receive a verbal confirmation from all other MBC operators prior to tramming.\n\t\xa0\nSpecific Fairchild MBC operator training was added to the approved training plan.\xa0 All Fairchild MBC operators have been trained accordingly.\n', 'CONCLUSION': 'On December 20, 2018, at approximately 3:00 a.m., Nevin Hostetter, a 35-year-old mobile bridge carrier operator with 5 years and 21 weeks of mining experience, was fatally injured when he was crushed between a bridge conveyor and a solid coal rib.\xa0 The accident occurred when the mobile bridge system was being trammed toward a continuous mining machine (CMM).\xa0 The accident occurred because the administrative and engineering controls and polices were not adequate to protect the victim from crushing injuries.\xa0\xa0_________________________

''}","on thursday, december 20, 2018, the eleven miners from the mmu 002 production crew gathered at the section at approximately 11:50 p.m. at about 12:20 a.m., after repairing the section conveyor belt, the crew began mining coal.  mike laue operated the cmm, darrell lane operated no. 2 mbc directly behind, and nevin hostetter (victim) operated no. 1 mbc behind that.  the mbcs were connected by a bridge conveyor and had to be moved in tandem.  a second bridge conveyor connected the no. 1 mbc to the section conveyor belt.  the mbcs did not have operator compartments; each one was operated separately using a remote control transmitter with a range of about 100 feet.after several hours of mining operations, laue began to position the cmm to mine the no. 5 entry.  lane and hostetter followed with the mobile bridge system, then stopped for a few minutes while laue positioned the cmm cable.at this time, the mbc operated by darrell lane was approximately 20 feet outby the back of the cmm. the mbc operated by hostetter (victim) was outby the corner of the intersection in the no. 3 entry, between the conveyor belt and the left coal rib.  hostetter was located on the outby corner of the intersection in the no. 3 entry (see appendix a).when laue finished positioning the cmm cable, lane used his cap light to signal to hostetter that it was time to move again.  lane began to tram the mbc forward but heard a loud metallic noise and was unable to continue forward.  lane yelled for hostetter and shut off his machine.  he yelled again and received no response.  lane could not see hostetter, so he crawled back and saw him pinned between the no. 1 bridge conveyor frame and the coal rib.  lane trammed the no. 2 mbc back, and hostetter fell to the mine floor.  lane pushed the panic button on the remote control transmitter to de-energize both mbcs, and yelled for laue and brian francisco, section foreman and emergency medical technician (emt).laue came from the cmm to the accident scene.  francisco was putting mining sights up in the no. 3 entry with mike scherer, scoop operator, when they both heard yelling and went to the accident scene.  other miners also heard yelling and went to the accident scene.  francisco assessed hostetter’s vitals and found no pulse or breathing.  francisco told the miners at the scene to call outside and tell ernie shaulis, outside attendant, to call 911 and then bring the first aid supplies and personnel carrier to the scene.  both francisco and scherer called andrew pianetti, mine examiner and emt, who was working outby the section and told him to come to the section.shaulis called 911 at 3:03 a.m. and then called vincent pelesky, safety supervisor, and bradley russian, pennsylvania bureau of mine safety (pa bms) inspector.  shaulis was contacted again from the miners underground and told to call for a helicopter.  he called for a helicopter and then met the ambulance to show them where to land the helicopter.hostetter was placed on the personnel carrier, which laue drove to the surface while pianetti and scherer attempted to provide care to hostetter.  pianetti and scherer did not detect vital signs and were unable to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation because of the trauma sustained by the victim.  when they arrived on the surface, both the boswell volunteer fire department and the somerset ambulance services were waiting for them in the pit.  the attendants from the ambulance service made the decision not to treat the victim any further.  he was placed into an ambulance and transported to the helicopter landing area, where he was pronounced dead at 3:33 a.m. by wallace miller, somerset county coroner, via telephone."

Safety ManagerA regular (E01) safety and health inspection had been started on the day of the accident.\xa0 The previous E01 safety and health inspection was completed on May 29, 2018.\xa0 The non-fatal days lost (NFDL) incident rate for the mine for 2017 was zero (0) compared to a national average of 1.12 for mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On Tuesday, December 11, 2018, Micky Cook, Front-End Loader Operator, arrived at the Little Spring Creek Mine to prepare for work on the day shift, which started at 6:00 a.m.\xa0 Gary McBee, Day Shift Mine Foreman, held a safety meeting with the day shift crew.\xa0 The day shift crew consisted of two excavator operators, three bulldozer operators, six rock truck operators, one coal hauler truck operator, two front-end loader operators, and two blast-hole drill operators. \xa0The day shift crew members proceeded to their respective job locations in the pit after the safety meeting.\xa0 Cook went to the coal pit to operate a Caterpillar 972G front-end loader and was assigned to load out coal and clean up blasted material.\xa0 Cook was operating the front-end loader parallel to, and approximately 25 feet from the base of, the 63-foot-high highwall, pushing blasted material toward a Komatsu PC1800 excavator operated by Jordan Self, Excavator Operator.\xa0 Self then loaded the material into rock trucks which transported the material to the spoil area.\xa0 This was a continual process during the production shift in this pit.At approximately 1:55 p.m., Kenneth McGruff, Fuel and Lube Service Truck Operator, was driving his truck into the pit area to grease the bucket of the excavator.\xa0 McGruff saw a large portion of the highwall fall onto Cook’s front-end loader.\xa0 Gabriel LaShum, Rock Truck Driver, who was returning from the spoil area, also observed a portion of the highwall topple.\xa0 The failed highwall material pushed the front-end loader about 10 to 15 feet in a direction away from the highwall and it came to rest approximately 40 feet from the highwall.McGruff immediately called McBee and Dwight Kitchens, Mine Superintendent, on the citizens band (CB) radio to notify them an emergency situation had occurred.\xa0 McGruff, Self, and LaShum waited for the dust to settle in the pit to ensure the area was safe and then walked to the front-end loader cab to evaluate Cook’s condition.\xa0 At approximately 2:00 p.m., Kitchens arrived at the accident scene.\xa0 Shortly afterward, McBee and Garry Murray, Rock Truck Driver and First Responder, arrived at the accident location.\xa0 Murray checked Cook for a pulse but none was detected.William Harbin, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector (CMI), was at the mine conducting an E01 inspection and was accompanied by Chris Rice, Safety Manager.\xa0 Harbin was inspecting in an area of the pit away from the accident location.\xa0 After overhearing the CB communications, Manson Hicks, Bulldozer Operator, notified Harbin and Rice of the accident.\xa0 While traveling to the accident scene, at approximately 2:00 p.m., Rice called 911.\xa0 Harbin issued a 103(k) order at 2:07 p.m.\xa0 Rice and Harbin arrived at the scene of the accident at about 2:15 p.m.McBee traveled to the mine office to gather first-aid supplies.\xa0 While he was at the office, the Curry Fire Department arrived on mine property at 2:15 p.m.\xa0 McBee escorted the fire department truck to the accident site.\xa0 Upon arrival, additional highwall debris started falling.\xa0 Harbin ordered everyone to move a safe distance away from the highwall.\xa0 Harbin and Rice traveled to the coal yard to gather additional equipment and returned to the accident scene.At approximately 3:15 p.m., the material ceased falling from the highwall.\xa0 Harbin conducted a visual examination of the highwall and allowed miners to resume efforts to free the front-end loader covered by the fallen highwall.\xa0 At approximately 4:18 p.m., a Komatsu PC2000 Excavator was used to retrieve the front-end loader and move it out of the pit and to a safe location away from the highwall.\xa0 While this process was taking place, the Regional Ambulance Service and Joey Vick, Walker County, Alabama Coroner arrived at the accident location. \xa0Vick pronounced Cook dead at 5:45 p.m.', 'INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT': 'Rice called the Department of Labor National Contact Center (DOL-NCC) at 2:10 p.m., to report the accident.\xa0 The DOL-NCC notified MSHA of the accident at 2:26 p.m.\xa0 Harbin, who was at the mine conducting an inspection, informed Craig Plumley, Assistant District Manager of Enforcement, of the accident.\xa0 Plumley contacted Samuel Creasy, District Manager; Edward Boylen, Birmingham Field Office Supervisor; Argus Brock, Roof Control Branch Supervisor; and Jarvis Westery, CMI/Accident Investigator.\xa0 Westery was dispatched to the mine to begin the accident investigation.\xa0 While Plumley, Boylen, and Westery were on their way to the mine, Harbin gathered preliminary information from mine personnel, examined the accident site, and monitored the recovery efforts. \xa0While recovery efforts were taking place, additional material began falling from the highwall.\xa0 As noted earlier, everyone was removed to a safe area until it was safe to resume recovery efforts.Leon Herren, Chief of Operations; and James R. West, Supervisor, both with the Alabama State Department of Labor (ADOL) were at the site to jointly conduct their accident investigation with MSHA.\xa0 West arrived at about 3:00 p.m. and Herren arrived at about 4:00 p.m.Plumley and Boylen arrived at the mine at approximately 4:00 p.m., and Westery arrived at roughly 5:00 p.m.\xa0 Plumley, Boylen, and Westery traveled to the accident site and were briefed by Harbin.\xa0 Harbin, Boylen, and Herren remained at the accident site to monitor the recovery operations.\xa0 Plumley, Westery, and West went to the mine office and conducted informal interviews with miners who might have information relevant to the accident.On December 12, 2018, Plumley, Westery, Brock, and West along with company officials and engineers continued the investigation.\xa0 Engineers used a drone to map and evaluate the post-accident geological features of the entire length of the highwall.On December 13, 2018, formal interviews were conducted at the MSHA Birmingham Field Office in conjunction with ADOL.\xa0 See Appendix A for a list of those who were interviewed.\xa0 James Pfeifer, Senior Civil Engineer, and Rodi Murad, Civil Engineer, both with MSHA’s Technical Support Mine Waste and Geotechnical Engineering Division (MWGED), arrived at the mine to continue the onsite investigation.', 'DISCUSSION': ""Mining ProcessThe typical mining sequence consists of removing spoil material from the rock strata, drilling into the rock strata, and blasting the overburden to a depth of approximately 4 feet above the coal seam.\xa0 This leaves a highwall ranging in height from 63 to 80 feet.\xa0 At the time of the accident, the highwall was approximately 3,000 linear feet long.\xa0 In August 2018, the mine operator began the mining operations that created this highwall. \xa0\xa0General Machine InformationThe front-end loader involved in the accident had 4 forward gears and 4 reverse gears, with a maximum forward speed of 23 miles per hour (mph) and 26 mph in reverse.\xa0 The loader had an operating weight of 54,963 pounds including the bucket.\xa0 It was approximately 30 feet long and 12 feet wide.\xa0 Although the loader frame was damaged by the highwall collapse, its engine was still operating when the machine was recovered from the rock.Accident LocationThe accident occurred near the base of the highwall on the northwestern area of the property.\xa0 The entire highwall was oriented in a northeast direction.\xa0 The area that failed was approximately 400 feet south of the northern end of the highwall.\xa0 The face of the highwall was sloped away from the pit approximately 20 degrees at most locations; however, there was at least one location south of the failure area where the upper portion of the highwall was sloped toward the pit.\xa0 There were no benches in the highwall.There was a geologic fault in the rock in the vicinity of the wall failure. \xa0The coal bed was 12 inches thinner on the left side of the failure. \xa0During the interview process, miners stated the fault had consistently existed in approximately the same location in previous pits. \xa0This anomaly provides an indicator of deformities that extended to the highwall.\xa0Accident Site GeologyThe strata above the coal seam generally consisted of 65 feet of shale and sandstone covered by about 20 feet of silty clay soil.\xa0 At the accident area, most of the silty clay soil overlying the rock had been removed before the highwall collapse.The failed portion of the highwall was triangular in shape, approximately 120 feet wide along the face of the highwall, and extended into the highwall approximately 40 feet.\xa0 Based on the dimensions of the failed area, investigators estimate that approximately 7,000 to 8,000 cubic yards of material failed.\xa0 The pile of debris from the failure extended up to the top of the highwall and out from the base of the highwall approximately 100 feet.Multiple discontinuities (rock joints) were observed in the exposed face of the highwall adjacent to the area that failed (see Appendix B).\xa0 The bearing of one set of rock joints was N64°E.\xa0 This is 48° off of the bearing of the highwall (N16°E).\xa0 This joint set defined one leg of the triangular-shaped failure.\xa0 The length of the failure area along this set of joints was approximately 90 feet.\xa0 The spacing of this set of exposed highwall joints, immediately behind the area that failed, ranged from approximately 2 feet to 4.5 feet.\xa0 The joints, and slabs of rock between the joints, were dipping 84.4° NW such that the rock was leaning toward the pit.\xa0 Joint openings were up to 3 inches and staining of the exposed faces of the intact rock was present.Investigators observed a second set of rock joints, with a bearing roughly perpendicular to the first set of joints (N37°W).\xa0 This joint set defined the second leg of the failure triangle.\xa0 The length of the failure area along this set of joints was approximately 60 feet.\xa0 The dip of this set of rock joints was approximately 70° NE such that the rock was leaning away from the pit (see Appendix C).Investigators observed conditions of the area above the highwall.\xa0 The vegetation within approximately 150 feet of the crest had been removed and silty clay soils overlying the rock were evident.\xa0 The soil was sloped down toward the crest of the highwall.\xa0 Most of the soil in the vicinity of the failure had been removed by pushing it over the highwall.\xa0 Less soil had been removed from the highwall in the area directly north and south of the failure.\xa0 The area to the north of the failure had been drilled and loaded for blasting just prior to the failure.Several tension cracks were present in the remaining soil at the top of the highwall in the failure area.\xa0 The tension cracks in the soil were roughly parallel to the highwall failure face and were up to approximately 2 inches wide.\xa0 The tension crack nearest the crest of the highwall had clean edges and did not appear to be filled with soil.\xa0 The tension cracks further from the top of the highwall appeared to be partially filled with soil.Factors in the highwall failure were the location and orientation of the joint sets in the rock mass relative to the orientation of the highwall along with possible weather-related factors discussed below.\xa0 The rock joints and rock slabs with a bearing of N64°E were leaning slightly toward the pit.\xa0 The rock joints with a bearing of N37°W provided a release (break) for the rock mass that was leaning toward the pit.\xa0 The staining on the face of the remaining rock indicated that the openings were preexisting and not due to blast fracturing (see Appendix D).Ground Control PlanThe mine operator’s GCP was acknowledged on October 2, 2015.\xa0 It detailed the plan to be used to assure that highwalls were safely created and provided provisions to follow when hazardous conditions were found.\xa0 The following provisions are specifically stated in the mine operator's GCP but were not being followed:Benches and Highwalls (page 3) - Minimum Bench Width: 100 feet; Maximum Spacing To and/or between Benches: 50 feet.\n\t\xa0\nGeneral Precautions (page 5, item 6) - Eliminating hazards from isolated individual rocks falling from a highwall will be accomplished through a combination of four (4) techniques: supporting or controlling the fall path of potentially loose rock, scaling the loose rock, providing rock catching benches or berms or both, and limiting the exposure of workers to areas where loose rock is present on the highwall.\n\t\xa0\nGeneral Precautions (page 5, item 7) - If stress cracks exist or stability failure occurs in any portion of the highwall, operations in the affected area will be immediately revised.\xa0 The revision will identify the reason for changes to the plan and will alert MSHA of the conditions resulting in the changes.\n\t\xa0\nGeneral Precautions (page 6, item 12) - When failure to control the developing highwall occurs, such as the existence of overhangs, loose material, unconsolidated rocks, material falling into the pit, movement in the wall, or blasting practices fail to result in a clean and stable highwall, and corrective action cannot be taken to eliminate the existence of these conditions, the affected area will be barricaded to prevent persons from being exposed to the conditions and the plan will be revised to safely control the highwall and provide for safe conditions.\nInterview testimony indicated that management witnessed hazardous highwall conditions, such as stress cracks and poor stability, in the same general area of the accident in the previously developed highwall.\xa0 The unsafe conditions served as a warning to management that the same or similar conditions may occur in future highwalls.\xa0 The previously observed hazardous highwall conditions did occur in the highwall involved in the accident, but management did not utilize appropriate safety measures to abate these hazards or barricade areas off to prevent miners’ exposure.\xa0 These safety methods are clearly spelled out in the mine’s GCP, and were not used.Weather ConditionsWeather can be a factor in highwall stability and may have been a factor in the failure of this highwall.Water was not observed seeping from the highwall in the area of the failure, however, two days before the accident about 3-inches of rain fell within a 24 hour timeframe.\xa0 With numerous rock joints in the highwall, it is probable that some of the joints filled with water.\xa0 On the day before the accident, the temperature was below freezing for about 10 hours.\xa0 Freezing temperatures may have caused the water that may have been present in the rock joints to freeze and expand.\xa0 The expanding water in the rock joints would have increased the horizontal forces on the slabs of rock between the rock joints, pushing the rock mass towards the pit.\xa0 On the day and at the time of the accident, the temperature was 47°F with no rain.As required by 30 CFR § 77.1004(a), highwalls, banks, benches, and terrain sloping into the working areas shall be examined after every rain, freeze, or thaw before miners work in such areas.\xa0 These examinations are to be made and recorded in accordance with 30 CFR § 77.1713.\xa0Daily InspectionsThe daily inspection record for December 11, 2018, was made after the failure and noted that the highwall had fallen.\xa0 Records of the daily inspections conducted for eight day shifts before the accident indicated that the highwall was “ok at this time.”\xa0 The eight previous daily inspections conducted for the second shifts indicated the highwall was “stable.”There were multiple noticeable discontinuities (rock joints) observed in the exposed face of the highwall adjacent to the area that failed and tension cracks in the soil roughly parallel to the highwall (see Appendix B).\xa0 Along its entire 3,000 linear feet of highwall, the highwall was greater than 50 feet high and no safety benches were constructed.\xa0 The GCP required a minimum 100-foot-wide bench be constructed for every 50 feet in highwall height.\xa0 For over three months, the mine operator developed the highwall in a manner that violated the provisions of the GCP.The hazardous conditions in the highwall, and the violations of the GCP, were obvious and widespread. \xa0The daily inspections performed by the mine operator were inadequate.Training and ExperienceOn December 17, 2018, Brett Calzaretta, MSHA Educational Field and Small Mine Services (EFSMS) Training Specialist, and Westery checked company training records at the mine office.Cook had 14 years of experience working at this mine.\xa0 On March 3, 2018, Cook received annual refresher training and experienced miner training, which included hazard training for this mine and other mine sites.\xa0 Task training was conducted on July 18, 2017 at this mine site for operation of the Caterpillar 972G front-end loader.\xa0 The training records were completed in accordance with the requirements of 30 CFR Part 48.In the interview process of the investigation, it became obvious to investigators that the foremen, the safety director, and the interviewed miners were not knowledgeable of key provisions of the GCP.\xa0 Consequently, training as required by the mine’s approved Training Plan was found to be ineffective and/or inadequate."", 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions which were implemented to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not conduct adequate daily inspections of the mine in that it did not recognize hazardous highwall conditions.\xa0 Failure to identify and correct the hazardous highwall conditions allowed miners to be assigned to work in close proximity to the hazardous highwall.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 All mine foremen were trained on February 11, 2019, regarding proper daily inspections and hazard recognition pertaining to surface mining.\xa0 The mine operator provided documentation of the training and the attendees.\xa0 MSHA monitored the training.\xa0Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not follow several provisions of the mine’s GCP.\xa0 The mine operator did not ensure that the miners were knowledgeable in the provisions of the mine’s GCP.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator submitted a revised GCP which was reviewed and acknowledged by the District on January 23, 2019.\xa0 The revision enhances safety by requiring, at all times, a 60-foot distance between the highwall and mobile equipment operators.\xa0 Blasting will remove 180 feet from the pit and mobile equipment operators will only excavate 120 feet of blasted material, leaving a 60-foot buffer between them and the highwall.\xa0 The mine operator trained all employees on the mine’s GCP on January 28, 2019, and provided documentation of the training and the attendees.', 'CONCLUSION': 'On Tuesday, December 11, 2018, at approximately 2:07 p.m., Micky Cook, a 38-year-old surface miner with 14 years of mining experience was fatally injured when a large portion of a highwall (approximately 7,000 to 8,000 cubic yards) toppled.\xa0 This caused rock to crush the operator’s cab of the front-end loader he was operating.\xa0 Cook was operating the front-end loader to remove blasted material near the base of a 63-foot highwall.The accident occurred because the mine operator did not conduct adequate daily examinations to identify hazardous highwall conditions and correct such hazards before allowing miners to work near the base of the highwall.\xa0 Additionally, the mine operator did not follow safety provisions of the mine’s Ground Control Plan (GCP).\xa0 If implemented, these GCP requirements would have caused several safety measures to be initiated to eliminate hazardous highwall conditions.\xa0 In addition, the mine operator did not adequately train miners regarding the safety provisions of the mine’s GCP.\xa0______________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0

DateDistrict Manager', '\xa0': '', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'Order No. 9132943 was issued to Cedar Lake Mining, Inc. on December 11, 2018, under the provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act:On December 11, 2018 at approximately 13:55, a fatal accident occurred from a fall of the highwall in the east end of the pit.\xa0 The victim was operating a model 972G Caterpillar front end loader, serial no. 4WW00619, in the pit pushing up rock to be loaded out of the pit.\xa0 A part of the highwall collapsed crushing the cab of the front end loader where the victim was located.\xa0 This order is hereby issued to ensure the safety and health of the miners including those involved in rescue and recovery operations or investigation of the accident.\xa0 The mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an Authorized Representative of the Secretary for all actions to recover and/restore operations in the affected area.\xa0 Additionally, the mine operator is reminded of its existing obligations to prevent the destruction of evidence that would aid in investigation the cause of the accident.104(d)(1) Citation No. 9132944 was issued to Cedar Lake Mining, Inc. for violation of 30 CFR §77.1000:On December 11, 2018, a Caterpillar 972G (Serial Number 4WW00619) front-end loader was operating near the base of a 63-foot high highwall to remove blasted material.\xa0 A large portion of the highwall (approximately 7,000 – 8,000 cubic yards of material) toppled onto the front-end loader, crushing the operator’s cab and fatally injuring the miner.\xa0 As a result of the fatal accident investigation, it is concluded that the mine operator did not comply with the provisions of the Ground Control Plan (GCP), acknowledged October 2, 2015 in the following manner:The surface mine highwall ranged in height from 63 to 80 feet over a linear distance of approximately 3,000 feet with no safety bench installed.\xa0 The highwall at the site of the accident was 63 feet in height with no safety bench in place.\xa0 Page 3 of the GCP requires a minimum 100 feet wide safety bench to be maintained at a maximum spacing to and/or between benches of 50 feet.\xa0 The highwall at the site of the accident was 63 feet in height with no safety bench in place.\n\t\xa0\nThe top of the surface mine highwall had loose, unconsolidated rock and material in numerous and extensive locations over a linear distance of approximately 3,000 feet with no adequate corrective measures implemented to eliminate the hazard. \xa0Page 3, Item 6 of the GCP specifies that eliminating hazards from isolated individual rocks falling from a highwall will be accomplished through a combination of four (4) techniques: supporting or controlling the fall path of potentially loose rock, scaling the loose rock, providing rock catching benches or berms or both, and limiting the exposure of workers to areas where loose rock is present on the highwall.\n\t\xa0\nEffective measures were not taken to eliminate the hazards of stress cracks which had developed in the highwall at the immediate location of the accident and in multiple locations along the linear distance of 3,000 feet of highwall. \xa0Page 5, item 7 of the GCP specifies that if stress cracks exist or stability failure occurs in any portion of the highwall, operations in the affected area will be immediately stopped, the affected area will be barricaded and the GCP will be immediately revised.\xa0 The revision will identify the reason for changes to the plan and will alert MSHA of the conditions resulting in the changes.\n\t\xa0\nEffective measures were not taken to control, correct or barricade adverse areas of the highwall at the immediate location of the accident. \xa0Page 6, item 12 of the GCP requires that when failure to control the developing highwall occurs, such as the existence of overhangs, loose material, unconsolidated rocks, material falling into the pit, movement in the wall, or blasting practices fail to result in a clean and stable highwall, and corrective action cannot be taken to eliminate the existence of these conditions, the affected area will be barricaded to prevent persons from being exposed to the conditions and the plan will be revised to safely control the highwall and provided for safe conditions.\nFor over three months, the mine operator developed the highwall in a manner that violated the provisions of the GCP.\xa0 Also, management witnessed hazardous highwall conditions, such as stress cracks and poor stability, in the same general area of the accident in the previously developed highwall.\xa0 The previous unsafe conditions served as a warning but management did not utilize appropriate safety measures to abate these hazards or barricade areas off to prevent miners’ exposure.\xa0 This violation is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory standard.104(a) Citation No. 9132945 was issued to Cedar Lake Mining, Inc. for violation of 30 CFR §77.1713(a):On December 11, 2018, a Caterpillar 972G (Serial Number 4WW00619) front-end loader was operating near the base of a 63-foot high highwall to remove blasted material.\xa0 A large portion of the highwall (approximately 7,000 – 8,000 cubic yards of material) toppled onto the front-end loader, crushing the operator’s cab and fatally injuring the miner.\xa0 Evidence obtained through the fatal accident investigation revealed the first and second shift mine examiners performed inadequate daily inspections by failing to identify, report and correct the following violations of the Ground Control Plan (GCP) and hazardous highwall conditions:The immediate highwall at the site of the accident was 63 to 80 feet in height with no safety bench in place for approximately 3,000 linear feet.\n\t\xa0\nThe top of the surface mine highwall had loose, unconsolidated rock and material in numerous and extensive locations over a linear distance of 3,000 feet with no adequate corrective measures implemented to eliminate the hazard.\n\t\xa0\nEffective measures were not taken to eliminate the hazards of stress cracks which had developed in the highwall at the immediate location of the accident and in multiple locations along the linear distance of 3,000 feet of highwall.\n\t\xa0\nEffective measures were not taken to control, correct or barricade adverse areas of the highwall at the immediate location of the accident.\nThe hazardous conditions in the highwall, and the violations of the GCP, were obvious and widespread.\xa0 Also, management witnessed hazardous highwall conditions, such as stress cracks and poor stability, in the same general area of the accident in the previously developed highwall.\xa0 The previous unsafe conditions served as a warning but management did not utilize appropriate safety measures to abate these hazards or barricade areas off to prevent miners’ exposure.The mine operator has engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence by failing to recognize and record these violations and hazardous conditions and take corrective actions.\xa0 This violation is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory standard.104(a) Citation No. 9132946 was issued to Cedar Lake Mining, Inc. for violation of 30 CFR §48.28(b)(4):On December 11, 2018, a Caterpillar 972G (Serial Number 4WW00619) front-end loader was operating near the base of a 63-foot high highwall to remove blasted material.\xa0 A large portion of the highwall (approximately 7,000 – 8,000 cubic yards of material) toppled onto the front-end loader, crushing the operator’s cab and fatally injuring the miner.\xa0 During the fatality investigation, formal interview testimony of miners and supervisors revealed that they were not knowledgeable in the provisions of the mine’s acknowledged Ground Control Plan.\xa0', 'APPENDIX A': ''}","on tuesday, december 11, 2018, micky cook, front-end loader operator, arrived at the little spring creek mine to prepare for work on the day shift, which started at 6:00 a.m.  gary mcbee, day shift mine foreman, held a safety meeting with the day shift crew.  the day shift crew consisted of two excavator operators, three bulldozer operators, six rock truck operators, one coal hauler truck operator, two front-end loader operators, and two blast-hole drill operators.  the day shift crew members proceeded to their respective job locations in the pit after the safety meeting.  cook went to the coal pit to operate a caterpillar 972g front-end loader and was assigned to load out coal and clean up blasted material.  cook was operating the front-end loader parallel to, and approximately 25 feet from the base of, the 63-foot-high highwall, pushing blasted material toward a komatsu pc1800 excavator operated by jordan self, excavator operator.  self then loaded the material into rock trucks which transported the material to the spoil area.  this was a continual process during the production shift in this pit.at approximately 1:55 p.m., kenneth mcgruff, fuel and lube service truck operator, was driving his truck into the pit area to grease the bucket of the excavator.  mcgruff saw a large portion of the highwall fall onto cook’s front-end loader.  gabriel lashum, rock truck driver, who was returning from the spoil area, also observed a portion of the highwall topple.  the failed highwall material pushed the front-end loader about 10 to 15 feet in a direction away from the highwall and it came to rest approximately 40 feet from the highwall.mcgruff immediately called mcbee and dwight kitchens, mine superintendent, on the citizens band (cb) radio to notify them an emergency situation had occurred.  mcgruff, self, and lashum waited for the dust to settle in the pit to ensure the area was safe and then walked to the front-end loader cab to evaluate cook’s condition.  at approximately 2:00 p.m., kitchens arrived at the accident scene.  shortly afterward, mcbee and garry murray, rock truck driver and first responder, arrived at the accident location.  murray checked cook for a pulse but none was detected.william harbin, coal mine safety and health inspector (cmi), was at the mine conducting an e01 inspection and was accompanied by chris rice, safety manager.  harbin was inspecting in an area of the pit away from the accident location.  after overhearing the cb communications, manson hicks, bulldozer operator, notified harbin and rice of the accident.  while traveling to the accident scene, at approximately 2:00 p.m., rice called 911.  harbin issued a 103(k) order at 2:07 p.m.  rice and harbin arrived at the scene of the accident at about 2:15 p.m.mcbee traveled to the mine office to gather first-aid supplies.  while he was at the office, the curry fire department arrived on mine property at 2:15 p.m.  mcbee escorted the fire department truck to the accident site.  upon arrival, additional highwall debris started falling.  harbin ordered everyone to move a safe distance away from the highwall.  harbin and rice traveled to the coal yard to gather additional equipment and returned to the accident scene.at approximately 3:15 p.m., the material ceased falling from the highwall.  harbin conducted a visual examination of the highwall and allowed miners to resume efforts to free the front-end loader covered by the fallen highwall.  at approximately 4:18 p.m., a komatsu pc2000 excavator was used to retrieve the front-end loader and move it out of the pit and to a safe location away from the highwall.  while this process was taking place, the regional ambulance service and joey vick, walker county, alabama coroner arrived at the accident location.  vick pronounced cook dead at 5:45 p.m."

compared to the national average of 2.54 for mine/facilities of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On Thursday, November 29, 2018, at 6:00 a.m., George Ney (victim) and John Seasock, Mechanics, began their shift.\xa0 They spent the morning performing maintenance on several mining vehicles. \xa0Then they went to a garage located at the facility to have lunch.While in the garage, David Morgan, Mine Superintendent, modified the hydraulic system on the Ford F-550 service truck that he used at the mine.\xa0 He removed the hydraulic hose reel and replaced it with a hose coupling connecting the hoses together. \xa0Morgan then removed the hydraulic oil cooler and plugged its lines with fittings.\xa0 He started the truck to check for hydraulic leaks, checked the operation of a bed-mounted crane, and then turned off the truck.After Ney finished his lunch, Morgan asked him if he knew anything about the hydraulics in the right rear compartment of the truck. \xa0Ney told Morgan to start the truck and he looked inside the hydraulic compartment.\xa0 Morgan told Ney he was going to turn off the truck because exhaust fumes were accumulating where Ney was standing.\xa0 Morgan heard a pop just before he turned off the truck.\xa0 He walked to the rear of the truck and saw Ney laying on the floor with an injury above his right eye.Seasock returned to the garage moments later and Morgan told him to call 911.\xa0 The 911 operator asked Morgan and Seasock to remove the coveralls from Ney and stay with him until the ambulance arrived.\xa0 An ambulance transported Ney to the Shenandoah, Pennsylvania baseball field, where he was transported by helicopter to Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, Pennsylvania.\xa0 He remained there until he died on December 30, 2018.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On November 29, 2018, at 1:36 p.m., Morgan notified the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center of the accident.\xa0 The contact center notified Timothy Horton, District 2 Office Assistant.\xa0 Patrick Boylan, Frackville Field Office Supervisor, dispatched Thomas Leshko, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Accident Investigator, to the mine.\xa0 Leshko arrived at the facility at approximately 2:05 p.m. and issued a 103(k) order to ensure the safety of all persons at the mine.Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) personnel conducted the accident investigation in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mine Safety (PA BMS) and company personnel.\xa0 The investigators conducted interviews with miners and photographed the accident scene.\xa0 Jonathan Hall, Mechanical Engineer with Technical Support, conducted an investigation of the hydraulic system on the truck on November 30, 2018.\xa0 See Appendix A for a list of persons interviewed and those participating in the accident investigation.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Truck and Hydraulic InformationThe service truck involved in the accident was a 2009 Ford F-550 purchased by the mine operator in September 2018. \xa0The truck was equipped with a power take off hydraulic pump, a Stellar 6620 crane, and outriggers. \xa0The truck also had a hose reel containing hydraulic hoses and a hydraulic cooling radiator, which were used for external hydraulic tools.An “on-off” switch on a panel near the rear of the truck controlled whether hydraulic pressure was directed to the hose reel or the crane. \xa0The “on” position typically sent up to 200 psi to the reel while the “off” position sent up to 3,000 psi to the crane (see Appendix B).\xa0 On the day of the accident, Morgan had modified the hydraulic system to direct 3,000 psi to the reel instead of the typical 200 psi when the switch was in the “on” position.\xa0 He told investigators that he modified the hydraulic system to remove components that were not needed for operation of the crane. \xa0The hydraulic reel circuit included a brass compression fitting that held a temperature sensor (see Appendix C).\xa0 The fitting had a maximum rating of 800 psi which is significantly less than the 3,000 psi it was subjected to after Morgan modified the hydraulic system.\xa0 Ney was examining this area at the time of the accident (see Appendix D).Likely ScenarioBased on a review of the evidence, inspectors believe it is most likely that Ney turned the on-off switch partially to the “on” position while examining the hydraulic system at close range. \xa0This would have directed excessive pressure to the hydraulic reel, causing the temperature sensor to burst from the fitting and strike the victim in the head.Once the victim was struck, the switch was released, causing it to move back to the “off” position.\xa0 A small amount of hydraulic fluid was found after the accident.\xa0 If the switch remained in the “on” position after the victim was struck, hydraulic fluid would have continued to be pumped out of the fitting.\xa0Training and ExperienceGeorge Ney had 29 years of mining experience at this mine.\xa0 Ney’s most recent annual refresher training was received on August 29, 2018.\xa0 He had no task training on the Ford F-550 truck or the hydraulic system located on the truck.\xa0 Task training should have included instruction in the safety and health aspects and safe work procedures of the hydraulic system.\xa0 No course material, or operator’s manual, was provided for training the miners to recognize and avoid hazards associated with the hydraulic system.Morgan was also not trained in the hydraulic system.\xa0 He was unaware of the effect of the changes he made to the hydraulic system.\xa0 The mine operator should have ensured that Morgan, Ney, and Seasock were properly trained, and that the hydraulic system was depressurized, before Morgan modified the hydraulic system and asked Ney to work on it.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \xa0A root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective action that was implemented to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not provide adequate task training on the hydraulic system on the truck before miners performed work on the hydraulic system.\nCorrective Action: \xa0The mine operator developed new task training incorporating best practices.\xa0 The operator provided new task training to miners who maintain and/or repair hydraulic systems.\xa0 This training included safe work procedures when working on hydraulic systems, with instruction to not pressurize hydraulic systems prior to the completion of repairs.\xa0', 'CONCLUSION': 'On Thursday, November 29, 2018, at approximately 1:05 p.m., George Ney, a 50-year-old mechanic with 29 years of mining experience received a critical injury while examining the hydraulic system on a service truck.\xa0 The hydraulic system had been modified earlier that day, causing excessive pressure to flow to a fitting that burst, propelling a temperature

Mercord and Baller then loaded a roll of conveyor belt onto the tractor-trailer.\xa0At 2:15 p.m., Baller left the Meadows Saw Shop in the tractor-trailer to proceed to McGregor.\xa0 Baller arrived at McGregor at 2:30 p.m. and parked the tractor-trailer on the truck loop, leaving it idling. \xa0He walked 3/10 of a mile up the haul road to get Truck 103, a Volvo A30C articulated haul truck and was unaware the truck’s retarder system did not work.\xa0 The grade of the winding haul road ranged from 10.5% to 21%, with an average grade of 14%.\xa0 Baller drove the haul truck down the hill, negotiating several curves, but failed to make the final turn.\xa0 The truck ran through a berm and travelled 39 feet through the air before hitting the ground 12 feet below.\xa0 After impact, the haul truck rolled forward 49 feet uphill and then rolled backwards 84 feet downhill. \xa0The rear tires travelled up a berm and caused the dump bed to fall on its side while the cab remained upright.\xa0At approximately 9:15 p.m., Mercord saw that he had a voicemail message from Baller’s wife.\xa0 Mercord called Baller’s wife and found out Baller had not come home.\xa0 Mercord then called Ben Henshaw, Quarry Manager for Montana Rockworks, Inc., to meet him at McGregor.\xa0 Mercord travelled to McGregor, arriving around 10:00 p.m., and found the damaged haul truck.\xa0 Mercord climbed up on the side of the haul truck and found Baller inside, unresponsive, suffering from extensive injuries, and not wearing a seatbelt.\xa0 At 10:15 p.m., Henshaw arrived and Mercord and Henshaw drove to the top of the haul road due to poor cell reception and called 911.\xa0 At 10:30 p.m., the two men went down the hill and drove to McGregor Lake Lodge to escort Emergency Medical Services personnel to the scene.\xa0 Baller was pronounced dead at the scene at 11:58 p.m.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'Brad Mercord called the Department of Labor National Contact Center (DOLNCC) at 11:45 p.m. on October 19, 2018, and notified MSHA of the accident. \xa0DOLNCC notified Sidney Garay, Supervisory Inspector in MSHA’s Rocky Mountain District. \xa0MSHA issued an order under provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to ensure the safety of the miners and began the investigation.\xa0MSHA’s accident investigation team travelled to the mine, conducted a physical examination of the accident, interviewed miners, and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident. \xa0MSHA’s Technical Support also assisted in examining and conducting tests on the haul truck. \xa0MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, miners and their representatives, Montana Safety and Health Bureau, and the Marion Police Department and Marion Fire Department.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred near the lower landing of the haul road that leads from the saw shop staging area.\xa0 The overall road is approximately 18 feet wide and 3/10 of a mile long, and varies in grade from 10.5% to 21%, with an average grade of approximately 14%.WeatherWeather reports on the day of the accident indicated mostly clear, sunny, with a high of 63°F. Investigators did not consider weather as a factor in the accident.Articulated Haul TruckThe haul truck involved in the accident was an unloaded Volvo A30C, a six-wheel articulated haul truck.\xa0 It had one drive axle on the tractor (tractor axle) and two drive axles on the trailer (front and rear bogie axles).\xa0 Product information indicated the haul truck had an overall width of 9 feet 7 ½ inches and an empty weight of approximately 44,755 pounds.\xa0General Condition of the Haul TruckThe trailer of the haul truck overturned during the accident, but the tractor remained upright.\xa0 The haul truck sustained damage to the underside of the front of the tractor, the cab interior and the right side trailer tire and rim assemblies.\xa0 The operator righted the trailer and towed the haul truck a short distance so MSHA Technical Support, with the assistance of mine maintenance personnel, could conduct a field inspection of the haul truck.\xa0 The accident damaged the engine oil pan assembly which caused the engine oil to drain out. Therefore, investigators were unable to operate the engine during the inspection.Transmission and Drivetrain DesignThe haul truck had an automatic transmission with 6 forward speeds, 2 reverse speeds, and a neutral position.\xa0 The transmission also had an integral hydraulic retarder.\xa0 There are 4 driver-selected transmission control positions in the forward direction:\xa0 D, 3, 2 and 1.\xa0 Investigators found the transmission’s gear selector lever in the “D” position.\xa0 In this position, the transmission automatically shifts through the forward gears and allows the haul truck to travel at maximum speed.\xa0 Product information indicates the maximum machine speed on level ground is approximately 32 ½ MPH.The haul truck can operate in 4-wheel drive, 6-wheel drive, and full 6-wheel drive (all longitudinal and transverse differentials locked for maximum traction force).\xa0 Operating the haul truck in full 6-wheel drive can adversely affect the steering of the truck. \xa0Investigators could not determine the haul truck’s operating mode at the time of the accident because modes can change when electrical power or air system pressure is lost. \xa0However, they found the haul truck was unable to operate in the full 6-wheel drive mode because the floor button in the cab had been disconnected, indicating the drive mode was not a factor in the accident.All of the drivetrain components were visibly intact and all 6 wheels rotated freely while towing the haul truck with the parking brake released.Service Brake and Parking Brake SystemsThe haul truck has an air-over-hydraulic service brake system with two air circuits – one for the tractor service brakes and one for the trailer service brakes. An engine-driven air compressor maintains air pressure. Actuators convert air pressure to hydraulic pressure to apply the disc brakes when the foot pedal is depressed.In order to test the haul truck’s service brake system, investigators used a remote air supply from a truck tractor in lieu of the haul truck’s air compressor.Investigators encountered two defects: The left side tractor service brake could not be locked on level ground with the truck bed empty; and overstroke sensors, which indicate when hydraulic pressure is low, were disconnected.\xa0 However, investigators determined that these defects did not contribute to the accident. Five of the six service brakes were still capable of skidding the tires in the accident area, and no conditions were found that would have triggered the overstroke sensors.The haul truck has an air release parking brake system.\xa0 To help control a moving haul truck in the event of an emergency, the parking brake design allows the truck driver to apply the parking brake while the truck is moving.\xa0 Investigators tested the parking brake and found that it was capable of skidding four of the six tires of the empty truck, as designed. However, the parking brake control was found in the release position and there was no indication it had been applied during the descent.\xa0Exhaust Brake SystemInvestigators found that the haul truck’s exhaust brake switch had been set to the “arm” or activate position. In that position, the exhaust brake would apply when the driver released the accelerator pedal to the idle position.Investigators were unable to test the performance of the exhaust brake system due to damage incurred during the accident, but they conducted tests on some components of the control circuit for the system.\xa0 The components tested were functional, including the spring return feature of the accelerator foot pedal. Investigators did not identify any defects that would have prevented the exhaust brake from functioning while the truck descended the haul road if the transmission was in gear and the truck driver released the accelerator pedal.Retarder SystemThe haul truck is also equipped with a hydraulic transmission retarder, which acts inside the transmission to slow the truck when an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) determines certain operational conditions exist. It is activated in three ways: 1) by applying a foot pedal mounted on the left side floor of the cab; 2) by applying the service brake when the retarder switch on the dash has been turned on; or 3) automatically when the transmission reaches 6th gear and the engine surpasses 2,400 RPM. Regardless of how the transmission retarder is activated, it can only function when the MA8 air valve is opened by the ECU.\xa0Investigators were not able to test the performance of the retarder system due to damage to the truck, but they did test some components of the system’s control circuit.\xa0Investigators encountered the following defects with the retarder system:\xa0 the inability of a solenoid to correctly control the MA8 air valve made all three methods of applying the transmission retarder ineffective; and a defective SE56 switch that would not allow the ECU to recognize that the truck driver was pushing the retarder pedal, making that option ineffective even if the MA8 air valve operated properly.\xa0 The defects in the Retarder System contributed to the accident.Steering SystemThe haul truck had an articulated steering system that used mechanical linkages to actuate a hydraulic steering control valve which then modulated two hydraulic cylinders, one on each side of the haul truck’s articulation joint.\xa0 A series of engine driven pumps provided hydraulic pressure to the steering valve.\xa0 In addition to providing approximately 45 degrees of steering in either direction, the articulation joint arrangement had an oscillating hitch.\xa0 This allowed complete independence of tractor rotation on the longitudinal axis, theoretically allowing the tractor to rotate 360 degrees with respect to the trailer.\xa0 The steering wheel used mechanical linkage to provide steering inputs to the hydraulic steering valve mounted beneath the rear portion of the haul truck’s cab.\xa0 The trailer also used mechanical linkage to provide position feedback of the trailer to the steering valve.\xa0 The trailer position feedback linkage caused the steering valve to automatically adjust to certain operating conditions to minimize driver workload.All of the mechanical steering linkages for the steering assembly and the hydraulic lines from the steering valve to the steering cylinders were visibly intact.\xa0 Manual cycling of the steering wheel verified the spool valve for the hydraulic steering valve appropriately modulated with the steering wheel without sticking or binding with the engine off.The haul truck also had a secondary steering pump in the event the primary steering system’s pumps failed to supply adequate pressure and flow.\xa0 The secondary steering pump is ground driven and the haul truck needs to move at least 2 miles per hour in the forward direction for it to operate properly.Due to the inability to run the haul truck engine, investigators could not test either the primary or secondary steering pumps for adequate pressure and flow nor could they test the hydraulic functions of the steering valve itself while on the haul truck.\xa0 Investigators did not conduct bench tests of these components.Suspension SystemAll of the haul truck’s suspension components were visibly intact.Seatbelt AssemblyThe operator’s seat had a self-retracting lap type seat belt assembly.\xa0 Both the latching mechanism and the self-retracting feature of the seat belt assembly functioned when tested. However, the seatbelt was not in use at the time of the accident, contributing to the severity of the operator’s injuries.Pre-operational Inspections of Haul TruckInvestigators reviewed the pre-operational inspection books for the haul truck.\xa0 The transmission retarder pedal was documented as non-functional in 23 pre-operational inspections since August 9, 2018, but the truck continued to be used for over 260 hours.\xa0 No documentation of a pre-operational inspection was found for the day of the accident.\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE': 'Jerry Baller worked at this mine for 17 years and 26 weeks. \xa0A representative of MSHA’s Educational Field and Small Mine Services (EFSMS) staff conducted a review of the operator’s training plan and records. \xa0EFSMS determined Mr. Baller received all required training, including annual refresher training according to 30 CFR Part 46.Investigators reviewed company policies and procedures in relation to the work being performed. The operator had inadequate policies in place at the time of the accident to address removing equipment from service when a safety defect is found.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'The accident investigation team conducted a root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the accident. The team identified the following root causes and the corresponding corrective actions implemented to prevent a recurrence of the accident.Root Cause:\xa0 Management did not have policies, procedures, and controls for removing equipment from service when a defect affecting safety is found.Corrective Action:\xa0 The Company developed policies and procedures for removing equipment from service when a defect is found.\xa0 The workforce at the mine was retrained using the new policies and procedures.Root Cause:\xa0 Management did not enforce its written policies, procedures, and controls for ensuring all miners wear seatbelts while operating mobile equipment.Corrective Action:\xa0 The Company retrained the workforce at the mine in the use and requirements of wearing seatbelts while operating mobile equipment.Root Cause:\xa0 Management did not enforce its written policies, procedures, and controls for ensuring mobile equipment operators complete pre-operational examinations prior to operating equipment.Corrective Action:\xa0 The Company retrained the workforce at the mine in performing pre-operational examinations of mobile equipment prior to operating any equipment.', 'CONCLUSION': 'Jerry Baller, Quarry Manager, died when the haul truck he was operating traveled through a berm while descending a ramp at the bottom of the quarry road.\xa0 The accident and fatality occurred because the mine operator did not: (1) maintain the haul truck’s retarder system in a functional state; (2) ensure miners wear seatbelts at all times when operating equipment, and (3) inspect equipment and review maintenance logs prior to placing it in service.', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'Order No. 9307909 – Issued October 19, 2018, under the provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act:A fatal accident occurred at the McGregor Quarry on 10/19/2018.

Herndon and R. Herndon fully advanced the seventh piece of auger steel and R. Herndon began setting the eighth piece of auger steel into the pan. \xa0According to W. Herndon, R. Herndon noticed that the auger steel was not properly positioned in the pan and that it needed to be adjusted so it would connect to the machine. \xa0R. Herndon used the onboard crane to reposition the auger steel and, while standing in an unsafe location, unintentionally pulled it from the auger pan and struck himself in the chest. \xa0R. Herndon was knocked onto the auger steel that was stacked on the ground adjacent to the auger machine.W. Herndon saw R. Herndon laying on the ground and ran to him.\xa0 W. Herndon calmed him down and laid him at the end of the auger machine. \xa0W. Herndon went to a coal truck and called for Holliday to come to the pit.\xa0 At approximately 10:30 a.m., Roger Woods, who was operating an articulating truck, told Holliday that W. Herndon wanted him to come to the pit.\xa0 Holliday arrived at the auger machine and began evaluating R. Herndon. \xa0W. Herndon traveled to the mine office to get first aid supplies and to call 911.\xa0 W. Herndon returned to the pit. \xa0Taylor, Woods and Heimberger had all arrived at the auger machine and were assisting Holliday administer first aid.Quinwood Emergency Ambulance arrived on scene at 10:59 a.m. and stopped at the top of the roadway leading down into the pit. \xa0R. Herndon was placed on a backboard and transported in a pickup truck out of the pit area to the ambulance. \xa0While R. Herndon was being transported out of the pit, Holliday started to administer cardio pulmonary resuscitation.When the group arrived at the ambulance, Quinwood Emergency Ambulance personnel took control of the victim.\xa0 R. Herndon was transported to the Greenbrier Valley Medical Center in Ronceverte, WV and was pronounced dead at 11:55 a.m. by Medical Examiner Andrea Orvik.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On October 17, 2018, at 10:55 a.m., Dameron notified Kelly Acord, MSHA Supervisory Special Investigator, of the accident.\xa0 At 11:00 a.m., Acord notified David S. Mandeville, MSHA District Manager, that there had been a serious accident at the No. 1 Surface Mine.\xa0 At 11:15 a.m., Acord notified Russell Richardson, Accident Investigator; Andrew Sedlock, Surface Inspector; Joseph Presley, Staff Assistant; and Donald Phillips, Conference Litigation Representative Supervisor, of the accident.At 1:55 p.m., Richardson, Presley, and Phillips arrived at the mine office and issued a 103(k) order to preserve the accident scene and to prevent the destruction of any evidence that would assist in determining the cause or causes of the accident.\xa0 They also conducted informal interviews with the miners and obtained their written statements.At 4:30 p.m., Sedlock arrived at the mine and performed initial function tests of the remote switch used to control the crane boom functions.\xa0 Sedlock reviewed examination and training records before traveling to the accident scene with Dameron and investigators from the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST).\xa0 The accident scene was secured, examined, and photographed.\xa0On October 18, 2018, Sedlock and MSHA electrical specialist John Stone returned to the mine to perform additional function tests.\xa0 Sedlock and Stone met with Dameron, Holliday, Woods, and Taylor.\xa0 Also present were representatives from the WVOMHST.On October 23, 2018, Richardson and Stone, MSHA Technical Support mechanical engineers Mark Kvitkovich and Ronald Medina, MSHA electrical supervisor Robert Hatfield, and Kendall Smith, WVOMHST Chief Electrical Inspector, returned to the mine site and met with Dameron. \xa0They tested the hydraulic system and determined the operating pressures.On October 25, 2018, MSHA and WVOMHST jointly conducted formal interviews at the Office of Miners Health Safety and Training Office in Oak Hill, West Virginia. \xa0The persons who participated in the investigation and were interviewed are listed in Appendix A.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Accident SceneThe auger crane boom was found to be extended out away from the auger machine with a piece of auger steel suspended on the crane rope hook. \xa0The remote crane boom controls were found on the ground near the operator deck (Appendix B). \xa0The weather was clear and 57 degrees. \xa0The ground around the auger was muddy and a stack of auger steel was stored next to the auger machine.Auger SteelThe piece of auger steel measures 18” in diameter, is 12’ in length, and weighs 647 lbs. \xa0The steel is loaded onto the machine using an onboard, overhead, hydraulically powered crane.\xa0 The auger helper adds or removes auger steel as needed.\xa0 The auger operator stands in a different location and operates the conveyor loadout, thrusting jack, and auger rotation.\xa0 The auger operator and auger helper have different and distinct tasks and do not supervise each other.Auger Machine Controls and Hydraulic SystemThe auger mining machine was manufactured by Salem Auger in 1986 and was purchased by the mine operator in April 2016.\xa0 The model number is S-1500-B and the serial number is 2-2 Job #K2313.A crane winch hydraulic motor (crane winch motor) lifts or lowers the auger steel by extending or retracting a wire rope.\xa0 A hook is permanently attached to the end of the wire rope for the purposes of lift or lowering.\xa0 As designed, relief valves limit the maximum pressure available to the crane winch motor to 1,700 psi, to extend or retract the wire rope.\xa0 Investigators performed testing and found hydraulic movements very erratic.\xa0 When tested, the maximum pressure available at the crane winch motor was 2,350 psi.\xa0 The hydraulic relief valve pressure of the crane winch motor (2,350 psi) was set 1.38 times higher than the manufacturer’s recommended setting (1,700 psi). \xa0This caused the wire rope and hook to jerk upward when trying to lift a load.\xa0 Investigators determined that adjustments were made to the operating hydraulic pressures that were not in accordance with the manufacturer’s specified pressure settings, but they could not determine who made the adjustments.A crane boom hydraulic cylinder (crane boom jack) rotates or swings the boom away from the auger machine or toward the auger machine.\xa0 Investigators found that the hydraulic relief valve pressure for the crane boom jack was 960 psi, which was 2.74 times higher than the manufacturer’s recommended setting of 350 psi. \xa0This caused the crane boom swing to operate suddenly with a jerking motion.\xa0 Investigators also found that, without any operator input, the crane boom was always moving at idle speed, either toward the machine or away from the machine.\xa0Investigators determined there was a defect in the crane boom swing toggle switch on the crane control handset.\xa0 See “boom out” and “in” in Appendix C.\xa0 When tested, in several instances this switch was placed in the swing out position, but the crane boom did not swing.\xa0 For it to work, the switch had to be moved back and forth a few times.Investigators found a brass alloy water-oil-gas gate valve, not a part of the original design, on the crane boom jack that was not rated for the operating pressure of the machine.\xa0 Also, an extra, unused switch marked “Trolley” was installed on the crane control (see Appendix C).\xa0 This “Trolley” control served no purpose since this machine did not have an extendable boom.Investigators determined that the remote was equipped with a crane boom in-out “Trolley” switch that was not connected because the boom did not have this capability to extend and retract the length of the boom.\xa0 The investigation team inspected the controls of the auger machine and conducted tests on the auger’s crane boom hydraulic functions.\xa0 Investigators determined that the on/off switch on the remote control was reversed (see Appendix D).\xa0 When the switch was in the “off” position, the system was actually on.\xa0 Also, the crane boom would slowly swing outward without operator input.\xa0 Testing showed that when the crane boom toggle switch was placed in the neutral (stopped) position, the crane boom would swing out slowly away from the machine instead of staying still.\xa0 The drift rate was 70 degrees per minute when there was no load on the crane boom and 45 degrees per minute when the crane boom was carrying an auger steel.Investigators found several hydraulic oil leaks, including some that were mixed with coal dust, and there were oil accumulations on the machine in various locations. Hydraulic oil was added as needed at a rate of approximately 1-2 gallons a day and there was nothing noted in the maintenance record book about the oil leaks. \xa0MSHA inspectors had previously issued two citations for oil leaks, and one citation for missing guarding, during the 24 months prior to the fatal accident.Investigators also determined the following:The hook permanently attached to the wire rope had been modified to the point that it could not be safely used to hoist the auger steel.\nA tagline was not being used to steady or guide the auger steel during installation and removal.\nPersons were not kept clear of auger sections being swung into position.\xa0 All miners must be outside the swing radius of the auger steel.\nAfter the fatal accident, the mine operator replaced the auger crane boom system with a hydraulic arm and claw system similar to an excavator with a claw.\xa0 This eliminated the need for miners to be near the side of the auger while auger steel is being installed or removed.Testing and ExaminationThe mine operator’s records indicate that a pre-shift examination and two on-shift examinations were conducted during each shift.\xa0 The pre-shift and the on-shift examination records did not show any hazards for the day of the accident.TrainingR. Herndon began working for the mine operator on October 15, 2018.\xa0 When he began his employment he had 12 years of underground mining experience, had completed new miner surface training, but had no surface mining experience.\xa0 The mine operator gave him experienced miner training on October 15, 2018.R. Herndon was hired to be an auger mining machine helper, a job he had never performed before.\xa0 The mine operator was required to provide task training which would include adequate training in the health and safety aspects and safe operating procedures for this task, equipment and machinery.The mine operator did not provide adequate task training because he did not provide adequate training in the health and safety aspects and safe operating procedures for this task, equipment and machinery.\xa0 Roger Woods, Auger Helper/Articulating Truck Operator, provided supervised operation training during production for a portion of the shift on October 15, 2018.\xa0 Woods then provided additional supervised operation training during production during the morning of October 16, 2018.\xa0 The October 16 training was performed for a portion of the shift until Woods left the job site to go to an appointment.\xa0 On Wednesday, October 17, 2018, R. Herndon was assigned to operate the auger crane while not being supervised.\xa0 As previously discussed, he positioned himself in a hazardous location while operating the auger crane with a suspended piece of auger steel attached which struck him in the chest resulting in fatal injuries.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management control.\xa0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the operator’s implemented corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident.Root Cause: \xa0Improper adjustments were made to the operating hydraulic pressures by persons not familiar with the manufacturer’s pressure settings.\nCorrective Action: \xa0The operating pressures in the hydraulic system were set properly.\xa0 The operator developed a written policy that permits only qualified employees to perform maintenance and adjustments on the auger mining machine.\xa0 All employees were trained in the new policy.Root Cause:\xa0 The task training provided by the operator was not adequate because the training did not include the health and safety aspects and safe operating procedures for the task, equipment and machinery, and supervised practice during nonproduction.\nCorrective Action: \xa0The operator revised its task training program to include the health and safety aspects and safe operating procedures for the task, equipment and machinery, and supervised practice during nonproduction.', 'CONCLUSION': 'On Wednesday, October 17, 2018, at approximately 10:25 a.m., Roger W. Herndon, a 33-year-old auger mining machine helper (in training) with approximately 3 days of surface mining experience, received fatal injuries when he was struck in the chest while moving a piece of auger drill steel (auger steel).\xa0 When he was struck, Herndon was using the onboard crane in an attempt to move a piece of auger steel onto the deck of the auger machine. \xa0The accident occurred because the victim was not adequately trained and was standing in an unsafe location.\xa0 Also, the mine operator did not properly maintain the auger’s hydraulic system which compromised the safety of miners operating the machine.Approved By:\xa0____________________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 _________________David S.

Dylan Filler, Roof Bolter (single boom); Austin Roy, Roof Bolter (twin boom); Jeff Fike, Roof Bolter helper (twin boom); Guzzo; and Rankin, performed their pre-operational equipment checks.\xa0 Brandon Keener, Scoop Operator, retrieved the battery-powered scoop from the outby charging station while Kaven Hornberger, Utility-man, waited on Keener.After completing the required checks, Guzzo trammed the CMM to the face of the No. 3 entry. \xa0Rankin and Cary trammed their MBCs behind the CMM.\xa0 The CMM and MBCs were linked to move together as a train.\xa0 Mining began at approximately 3:25 p.m.\xa0 After completing the mining sequence in the No. 3 entry, the train was trammed backward and moved from the No. 3 entry, through the last open cross-cut intersections.\xa0 The train then moved so the CMM entered the working place of the No. 1 entry, and the CMM was then used to remove a small (wedge) cut of coal from the No. 1 working face.After completing the cut in the No. 1 entry, the train was trammed backward, allowing Filler to tram the single-boom roof bolting machine into the No. 1 entry to install roof bolts.\xa0 This placed the No. 1 MBC just outby the intersection of No. 3 entry, between the conveyor belt and the right rib line.\xa0Guzzo and Baumgartner were on the outby end of the intersection, in the No. 2 entry, on the left side of the CMM.\xa0 Guzzo signaled to Rankin using his cap-light that he was ready to move the CMM into the No. 2 entry.\xa0 Because of the elevation difference between No. 2 and No. 3 entries, Rankin may not have seen the signal.\xa0At approximately 4:08 p.m., Guzzo began using the remote control transmitter to tram the CMM into the No. 2 entry.\xa0 Both Guzzo and Baumgartner detected that the No. 1 MBC was causing unusual resistance as the CMM moved forward.\xa0 Guzzo stopped the CMM and Baumgartner said that he was going to the No. 1 MBC to determine the cause of the resistance.\xa0 Baumgartner crossed over the bridge conveyor and approached the No. 1 MBC.\xa0 He observed Rankin on the MBC with his back against the controls and his legs in an awkward position.\xa0 At this time, Rankin’s MBC was positioned in the intersection of the No. 3 entry with the rear (outby side) of the machine against the right rib (see Appendix B).\xa0 The front of the MBC had pushed the belt conveyor tailpiece out of alignment.\xa0 Guzzo decided to go to the No. 1 MBC and came to the victim’s location.\xa0 Baumgartner told Guzzo that the situation was bad and that he was going to call outside.\xa0 He then signaled Cary, with his cap-light, to come up to the No. 1 MBC.At approximately 4:12 p.m., Baumgartner went to the No. 4 entry where hand-held radio reception was better, and called Ben Bowser, Surface Attendant.\xa0 Bowser was instructed to call for an ambulance.\xa0 Jack Ishman, Beltman and Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), was travelling the No. 3 beltline and overheard the radio conversation and immediately came to the accident scene.\xa0 As soon as J. Ishman viewed Rankin, he left to retrieve medical supplies and a backboard from the section first aid supply station.\xa0 Guzzo brought the battery-powered scoop to the accident scene.\xa0 J. Ishman, Cary, and Guzzo secured Rankin to the backboard and placed him in the scoop bucket for transport.\xa0 Guzzo operated the battery-powered scoop.\xa0 J. Ishman and Cary began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and continued during the ride to the mine’s slope.\xa0 While traveling, they were met by Don Ishman, Mine Foreman, who assisted in administering CPR. \xa0When they reached the bottom of the slope, Rankin was transferred from the battery-powered scoop to a diesel-powered scoop bucket which was more capable of ascending the steep grade to the surface.\xa0 Guzzo operated the diesel scoop and CPR was continued.\xa0 Attendants from Brockway Area Ambulance Service, Brockway, Pa., were waiting on the surface, and at 4:47 p.m., took over treatment of Rankin.At 6:01 p.m., Brenda Shumaker, Jefferson County Coroner, pronounced Rankin dead at the mine.\xa0 The victim was transported to the Coroner’s Morgue in Punxsutawney, Pa.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'At 4:13 p.m. on September 11, 2018, Bowser notified the Department of Labor National Contact Center of the accident.\xa0 The contact center notified Randall Caramellino, Staff Assistant, at 4:30 p.m.\xa0 Caramellino contacted D. Ishman at the mine and learned that the accident was very serious.\xa0 Caramellino contacted Jason Boring and James Miller, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspectors (CMI) and Accident Investigators, who were dispatched to the mine.\xa0 Richard Feigh, Coal Mine Safety and Health Specialist (Electrical), from the Clearfield Field Office was dispatched to the mine. \xa0Feigh arrived at the mine at approximately 6:10 p.m., and issued a 103(k) order to ensure the safety of all persons in the mine. \xa0Robert Roland, Clearfield Field Office Supervisor, also traveled to the mine to provide assistance.Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) personnel conducted the accident investigation in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mine Safety (PA BMS) and mine management. \xa0The investigation team conducted interviews with miners, travelled underground, and took pictures and measurements of the scene. \xa0See Appendix C for a list of persons interviewed and those participating in the accident investigation.On September 12, 2018, Miller and Michael Kelley, Assistant District Manager for Enforcement, travelled underground to the accident scene. \xa0Later that same day, Feigh, Boring, and the PA BMS electrical specialists examined the CMM and MBCs to see if there were any electrical or mechanical deficiencies.\xa0 They attempted to recreate the movement of the machinery that may have caused the accident, but without a witness to the accident, the recreation could not be done.On September 17, 2018, Feigh accompanied MSHA Technical Support personnel Patrick Retzer and Justin Daniels, Electrical Engineers, and Matt Wharry, Industrial Engineer to the mine.\xa0 They travelled underground to examine the proximity detection system on the CMM.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Accident SceneThe accident occurred in the No. 3 entry intersection of the C-8 Butt Rooms Section.\xa0 The CMM backed up across the No. 2 entry intersection to allow the single-boom roof bolter to pass by into the No. 1 entry.\xa0 This action placed the No. 1 MBC (victim’s MBC) just outby the intersection of the No. 3 entry, alongside the stationary conveyor belt. \xa0The No. 1 MBC was idle indicating that the victim was not tramming it at the time of the accident. \xa0The CMM, while it was trammed backward, then forward, pinched the victim between the MBC and the coal rib (see Appendix B).\xa0 The victim was moved along the rib line for approximately 8 feet until the MBC reached the right outby corner of the intersection in No. 3 entry.\xa0 The mined height at the victim’s location is 46 inches.\xa0 The mine floor was dry.Continuous Haulage Mining SystemThe continuous haulage mining system involved in the accident is an “attached system,” meaning that the MBCs and bridge conveyors are physically attached to the CMM, forming a train (see Appendix A).\xa0 The train consists of one CMM, two MBCs, and three bridge conveyors.\xa0 The MBCs are controlled by equipment operators who start and stop the bridge conveyors as needed.An Eimco continuous mining machine (CMM), model number 25M-0, was connected to the first bridge conveyor, which was connected to the No. 1 Long Airdox MBC, model number MBC-27CL.Next, the No. 1 MBC, operated by Rankin, was connected to the second bridge conveyor, which was connected to the (outby) No. 2 Long Airdox MBC, model No. 27CL, which was operated by Cary.\xa0 The No. 2 MBC, in turn, was connected to the final bridge conveyor.\xa0 As previously explained, mined coal was transported from the CMM, across the MBCs and bridge conveyors and dumped onto the section conveyor belt, which was connected to the main belt conveyor system, which carried the mined material to the surface.Mobile Bridge Carrier OperationOperator controlsThe MBCs are operated manually, with the controls being on the side of the machine.\xa0 Due to the low mining height, the operator typically crawls beside the machine as it moves forward and backward.\xa0 The No. 1 MBC involved in the accident was equipped with a piece of conveyor belt material that was attached to the MBC so Rankin could ride on it as the unit moved across the mine floor.\xa0 This piece of conveyor belt is commonly referred to as the “magic carpet.” \xa0The magic carpet is typically used when there is no operator’s deck attached to the machine.\xa0 The deck is a solid platform for the machine operator to sit on and ride as the controls are operated.\xa0 The deck provides lateral protection against crushing hazards because the metal deck frame extends beyond the MBC operator’s body.\xa0 The No 1 MBC was manufactured in 1988 with an operator’s deck, but when it began to be used at the Kocjancic mine in 2013, it did not have an operator’s deck.\xa0 Investigators were not able to determine when the deck was removed or who removed it.CommunicationInvestigators learned that the CMM operator commonly flashed his cap-light to the No. 1 MBC operator in order to signal his intentions to move forward or backward.\xa0 This method of communication is unreliable because it is difficult for others to see the signals when the coal seam is changing in elevation and/or the mining equipment is blocking the view of the equipment operators.\xa0 Also, signaling does not provide confirmation that the MBC operator understood the signal. \xa0A positive means of verbal communication by radio or pager would help to prevent miscommunication.Stopping and starting the CMM and MBCsInvestigators determined that the CMM moved the No. 1 MBC while it was idle.\xa0 Because of this, investigators determined the scenarios in which the CMM could move the MBCs without the MBCs being trammed with the CMM.\xa0 First, when the CMM was turned off manually or with the emergency stop button, the MBCs were de-energized.\xa0 The CMM was then re-started and trammed prior to the MBCs being re-started.\xa0 Therefore, the CMM was able to move the MBCs while they were de-energized.Secondly, the Eimco 25M-0 continuous mining machine is equipped with a model MDG MX3 IntelllliZone proximity detection system (PDS), manufactured by Matrix Design Group.\xa0 The PDS utilizes an electromagnetic field and line-of-sight radio signal which allows the machine mounted components (electromagnetic field generators), and miner wearable components (MWC), to communicate with one another.\xa0 When a miner wearing a MWC approaches a set distance from the continuous mining machine, an electromagnetic field is generated.\xa0 This action triggers a warning (flashing yellow light and audible alert) on the continuous mining machine and the miner’s MWC.\xa0 If the miner continues toward the CMM, a “shutdown zone” is triggered, indicated by a flashing red light and continuous audible alarm, on both the CMM and the MWC.Investigators determined that entering the shutdown zone disabled the tram and conveyor boom functions of the CMM and shut down the MBCs.\xa0 However, when a MWC was moved away from the shutdown zone, the tram and conveyor boom functions of the CMM were restored so that it could move the MBCs while they were de-energized.Training and ExperienceRankin had 7 weeks of underground mining experience, of which 2 weeks were as an MBC operator.\xa0 He gained all of his experience at the Kocjancic mine.\xa0 Rankin received 40 hours of new miner training from July 16, 2018 through July 20, 2018.\xa0 This training was a combination of classroom training and a mine tour provided by the mine operator.\xa0 The victim’s underground experience from July 20, 2018, until August 16, 2018, involved general labor duties as he became familiar with the mine and working section.On August 16, 2018, Baumgartner task trained the victim to be a MBC operator.\xa0 The task training covered instruction in the health and safety aspects and safe operating procedures related to operating a MBC.\xa0 This involved instruction on pre-operational checks, examining the MBC for loose covers or broken parts, removing combustible material from the MBC, inspecting the fire suppression system, examining tram roads, operational checks and controls, exercising caution near cables and workers, post-operational checks, and de-energizing at the end of the shift.\xa0 This task training also instructed Rankin to keep his extremities in a safe location at all times.Supervised practice was provided prior to the beginning of production and supervised operation during production.\xa0 On August 17, 2018, Rankin was assigned to operate the No. 1 (inby) MBC, which he did for the two weeks and three days leading up to the accident.The operator submitted an addendum to the approved training plan which addresses the task training provided to new MBC operators.The addendum prohibits new miners from operating MBCs within their first thirty days.After thirty days, the new miner must receive supervised practice during nonproduction, supervised operation during production, and training in all safety devices and policies.The training plan addendum was approved by MSHA on October 30, 2018.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions that were implemented to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not provide a means of protection against crushing injuries to the MBC operator.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator installed a substantially constructed equipment operator’s deck for lateral protection against crushing injuries to the MBC operator. \xa0The construction of the deck is consistent with the original equipment manufacturer’s design. \xa0Additionally, the mine operator installed “man-in-position” safety devices on the MBCs to deactivate the tram motors of the CMM and both MBCs when an MBC operator exits the operator’s deck.\xa0 The devices prevent restarting the CMM or any MBC until the operator returns to position.\xa0 The mine operator also instituted preoperational examinations of the man-in-position safety device.\xa0 The examination and results must be recorded and signed by a foreman, and defects affecting safety must be fixed before any MBC is used.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not provide a means for the MBC operators and the CMM operator to communicate verbally before the CMM is trammed.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator provided all MBC operators and the CMM operator with a stand-alone, permissible, two-way voice communication system.\xa0 The mine operator instituted a company policy that requires the CMM operator to receive verbal confirmation from the MBC operators prior to starting to tram.\xa0 All CMM and MBC operators have been trained in this policy.Root Cause:\xa0 There was no electronic means provided to prevent the CMM from tramming and dragging the MBC while the MBC was de-energized.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator installed a system that causes all the tram functions of all electrical components (CMM and MBCs) to be de-energized when one component shuts off, either intentionally or by proximity detection.\xa0 Additionally, the system requires a physical start-up function that must be performed on each component before any of the components have the ability to tram.', 'CONCLUSION': 'On Tuesday, September 11, 2018, at approximately 4:10 p.m., Kameron Rankin, a 27-year-old mobile bridge carrier operator with 7 weeks of mining experience was fatally injured.\xa0 The accident occurred when the continuous mining machine was being re-positioned.\xa0 Because the victim’s mobile bridge carrier was connected to the mining machine, the carrier moved and the victim was crushed between the carrier and coal rib.\xa0The accident occurred because the administrative and engineering controls in place at the mine were not adequate to protect the victim from crushing injuries.Approved

Additional controls are necessary to prevent this type of accident and to provide additional layers of protection:(1) A means for effective verbal communication between the CMM operator and MBC operator, (2) an operator’s deck that provides protection against crushing injuries, (3) interlocked shut down and start up electrical controls, and (4) a man-in-position device and associated preoperational examinations to ensure functionality.This is a notice to provide safeguard requiring:All MBCs shall have a written pre-operational check performed, which includes checking each man-in-position switch and panic bar, prior to putting the equipment into service each shift.\xa0 All deficiencies found that affect safety must be corrected before any MBC is put into service.\xa0 The pre-operational checks, deficiencies found, and corrective actions, shall be documented in the foreman’s note pad made available to MSHA upon request and recorded in a book.\xa0 The record book of the pre-operational checks shall be promptly dated and signed or countersigned by a foreman.\xa0 The book of pre-operational checks will be retained at a surface location at the mine for at least one year and shall be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners.\n\t\xa0\nAll MBC operators, and the CMM operator, shall be provided with a stand-alone permissible two-way voice communications system.\xa0 Such communication shall be either hardwired on the machine, or a wireless device, worn by the machine operators.\xa0 If a wireless device is used, a separate radio frequency specified for such use only, shall be provided.\xa0 CMM operators must receive a verbal confirmation from the MBC operators prior to tramming.\n\t\xa0\nAll electrical components of the continuous haulage system shall be so designed that when one component shuts off, either intentionally or by proximity detection, the tram functions of all components will be de-energized.\xa0 Additionally, a start-up procedure shall be utilized to assure that all component operators must perform a physical function related to re-starting before any of the components begin to tram.\n\t\xa0\nAll MBCs shall be provided with a substantially constructed deck.\xa0 Such decks shall be constructed for the lateral protection of, and other crushing injuries to, the operator.\xa0 The construction of such operator deck components shall be as close as practical to the original equipment manufacturer's design criteria.\n\t\xa0\nAll MBCs shall be provided with a man-in-position safety device.\xa0 This device will be installed to deactivate the tram motors of the CMM and all MBCs when an MBC operator exits the operator's compartment.\xa0 The switch shall automatically de-energize all tram motors and prevent restarting the motor of any MBC or the CMM until the operator returns in position.\xa0 This safety device shall be functional when repositioning during the mining cycle or tramming equipment from one place to another as an attached system.\n"", 'Appendix C': ''}","on tuesday, september 11, 2018, at 3:00 p.m., the c-8 butt rooms section (mmu 001-0) crew, including kameron rankin, no. 1 mbc operator, began their shift.  the miners travelled underground to the section, arriving at approximately 3:10 p.m.  crew member joe guzzo, cmm operator, had arrived on the section earlier.jason baumgartner, section foreman, conducted an examination of the workplaces.  jeremy cary, no. 2 mbc operator; dylan filler, roof bolter (single boom); austin roy, roof bolter (twin boom); jeff fike, roof bolter helper (twin boom); guzzo; and rankin, performed their pre-operational equipment checks.  brandon keener, scoop operator, retrieved the battery-powered scoop from the outby charging station while kaven hornberger, utility-man, waited on keener.after completing the required checks, guzzo trammed the cmm to the face of the no. 3 entry.  rankin and cary trammed their mbcs behind the cmm.  the cmm and mbcs were linked to move together as a train.  mining began at approximately 3:25 p.m.  after completing the mining sequence in the no. 3 entry, the train was trammed backward and moved from the no. 3 entry, through the last open cross-cut intersections.  the train then moved so the cmm entered the working place of the no. 1 entry, and the cmm was then used to remove a small (wedge) cut of coal from the no. 1 working face.after completing the cut in the no. 1 entry, the train was trammed backward, allowing filler to tram the single-boom roof bolting machine into the no. 1 entry to install roof bolts.  this placed the no. 1 mbc just outby the intersection of no. 3 entry, between the conveyor belt and the right rib line. guzzo and baumgartner were on the outby end of the intersection, in the no. 2 entry, on the left side of the cmm.  guzzo signaled to rankin using his cap-light that he was ready to move the cmm into the no. 2 entry.  because of the elevation difference between no. 2 and no. 3 entries, rankin may not have seen the signal. at approximately 4:08 p.m., guzzo began using the remote control transmitter to tram the cmm into the no. 2 entry.  both guzzo and baumgartner detected that the no. 1 mbc was causing unusual resistance as the cmm moved forward.  guzzo stopped the cmm and baumgartner said that he was going to the no. 1 mbc to determine the cause of the resistance.  baumgartner crossed over the bridge conveyor and approached the no. 1 mbc.  he observed rankin on the mbc with his back against the controls and his legs in an awkward position.  at this time, rankin’s mbc was positioned in the intersection of the no. 3 entry with the rear (outby side) of the machine against the right rib (see appendix b).  the front of the mbc had pushed the belt conveyor tailpiece out of alignment.  guzzo decided to go to the no. 1 mbc and came to the victim’s location.  baumgartner told guzzo that the situation was bad and that he was going to call outside.  he then signaled cary, with his cap-light, to come up to the no. 1 mbc.at approximately 4:12 p.m., baumgartner went to the no. 4 entry where hand-held radio reception was better, and called ben bowser, surface attendant.  bowser was instructed to call for an ambulance.  jack ishman, beltman and emergency medical technician (emt), was travelling the no. 3 beltline and overheard the radio conversation and immediately came to the accident scene.  as soon as j. ishman viewed rankin, he left to retrieve medical supplies and a backboard from the section first aid supply station.  guzzo brought the battery-powered scoop to the accident scene.  j. ishman, cary, and guzzo secured rankin to the backboard and placed him in the scoop bucket for transport.  guzzo operated the battery-powered scoop.  j. ishman and cary began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) and continued during the ride to the mine’s slope.  while traveling, they were met by don ishman, mine foreman, who assisted in administering cpr.  when they reached the bottom of the slope, rankin was transferred from the battery-powered scoop to a diesel-powered scoop bucket which was more capable of ascending the steep grade to the surface.  guzzo operated the diesel scoop and cpr was continued.  attendants from brockway area ambulance service, brockway, pa., were waiting on the surface, and at 4:47 p.m., took over treatment of rankin.at 6:01 p.m., brenda shumaker, jefferson county coroner, pronounced rankin dead at the mine.  the victim was transported to the coroner’s morgue in punxsutawney, pa."

Additionally, the mine operator did not ensure the primary egress stairs and the alternate egress ladder were properly installed and maintained, impeding Grostefon’s ability to escape the fire.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'The Bear Run Mine is a surface coal mine located near Carlisle, Sullivan County, Indiana, and is operated by Peabody Bear Run Mining, LLC.\xa0 The mine started producing coal from the Springfield 7, 6, 5, and 5A seams on September 13, 2010.\xa0 The coal seams are accessed by two multiple-bench open pits and occasional highwall mining machines.\xa0 At the time of the accident, the mine employed 619 employees and 93 contract laborers.\xa0 The mine operates two 10-hour production shifts, seven days per week, producing approximately 20,000 tons of coal per day.\xa0 The production process involves two draglines, shovels, and haul trucks.\xa0 Maintenance is performed between production shifts.The principal officers at this mine at the time of the accident were:Drew Kimery................................................................ General ManagerJeff Wheeler............................................................. Production ManagerAt the time of the accident, a regular (E01) safety and health inspection was in progress. \xa0The previous E01 inspection was completed on March 28, 2018.\xa0 The non-fatal days lost (NFDL) incident rate for the mine for 2017 was 0.64, compared to the national average of 0.78 for mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On Thursday, September 6, 2018, at approximately 6:45 p.m., Robert A. Grostefon reported for work on his normally scheduled night shift.\xa0 Grostefon was assigned to operate a Caterpillar 793C haul truck, hauling overburden. \xa0His travel route for this shift was from the company number 1-195 shovel, located in Pit 4, to the North and South ends of the Pit 4 dump, a distance of approximately 1 mile.At approximately 3:40 a.m., Grostefon drove to the South dump and positioned the truck to dump the load of overburden near the berm of the dump site. \xa0John Moreland, Bulldozer Operator, noticed flames coming from underneath the operator’s cab and wrapping around to the front of the truck as it passed by.\xa0 Moreland told investigators that he attempted to contact Grostefon on the company radio to notify him of the fire, but by then Grostefon was already trying to get off the truck. \xa0Moreland called out a Code Red over the company radio to report an equipment fire on the Pit 4 South dump site.\xa0 A Code Red is used at the mine to alert miners and the mine’s emergency response crews of an emergency situation.\xa0The company dispatch center reported that Grostefon’s truck went offline at approximately 3:44 a.m.\xa0 The truck likely lost communication due to fire damage to the electrical wiring.According to comments by Grostefon during the rescue and in the hospital, as well as testimony from witnesses, Grostefon tried twice to actuate the fire suppression system in the cab but it did not activate.\xa0 As Grostefon exited the left side of the cab, he received burns from flames coming through the grated steel walkway outside, and his polyester shirt caught on fire. \xa0Grostefon continued along the grated steel walkway while trying to remove his shirt.\xa0 He attempted to use the alternative egress ladder but he could not unfasten a section of handrail that blocked him. He then descended the truck’s main stairs, in front of the engine. The stairs ended at a platform about 5 feet 3 inches above the ground. From there, another set of stairs is usually lowered to the ground using hydraulic power. However, the Power Step stairs did not fully descend when Grostefon tried twice to lower them. He then jumped to the ground.Moreland exited the bulldozer and went toward Grostefon’s truck. When he saw that Gostefon was clear of the fire, he returned to his bulldozer to reposition it out of the way of emergency vehicles.Cody Faulk, Fill-in Shift Foreman, was at the equipment parking area when he heard Moreland announce the Code Red. He drove to the South dump, calling for a company ambulance over the radio on the way. He told the ambulance crew to go to the Intercept 1 point at the Pit 4 employee parking lot.Faulk arrived at the accident site about 2 to 3 minutes after hearing the Code Red. \xa0He saw Grostefon bent over with his shirt lying on the ground. \xa0Grostefon got in Faulk’s pickup truck and they moved away from the fire. \xa0After Moreland also got in the truck, Faulk drove to the Intercept 1 point.\xa0 Tyler Potts, Senior Lead Shot Firer, followed Faulk’s truck to the Intercept 1 point.When the group arrived at the Intercept 1 point, Grostefon was transferred to the company ambulance driven by Matt Plano, Preparation Plant Electrician. Moreland, Potts, and Plano, all members of the Surface Mine Emergency Team (SMET), treated Grostefon’s burns by irrigating them with saline and applying burn gel bandages. \xa0Grostefon had burns on his head, back, and arms.\xa0 The SMET team assessed them as 2nd degree burns.Josh Damron, Water Truck Operator, arrived at the scene of the accident 4 to 5 minutes after hearing the Code Red over the company radio. \xa0Damron extinguished the fire in approximately 5 minutes, using the water cannon on the truck.\xa0 Damron then repositioned the water truck to spray water on the left front tire to help cool it. \xa0An additional company water truck and a volunteer fire crew from Dugger, Indiana arrived on scene to assist.The Sullivan County Ambulance Team arrived at 4:23 a.m. and took over Grostefon’s care. Grostefon was taken to Terre Haute Regional Hospital in Terre Haute, Indiana.\xa0 After his injuries were assessed, he was transferred to Eskenazi Burn Center in Indianapolis, Indiana.\xa0 Grostefon died from complications from his injuries after five days of treatment.\xa0 He was pronounced dead on September 12, 2018, at 7:12 p.m.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'The accident occurred on September 7, 2018, at approximately 3:44 a.m.\xa0 It was not immediately reported by the mine operator because Grostefon’s injuries were not initially considered to be reportable. After the injuries were reassessed at Terre Haute Regional Hospital, the mine operator notified MSHA.Brock Rider, Safety Supervisor, called the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center at 7:46 a.m. on September 7, 2018, to report the accident.\xa0 At 8:01 a.m., the Contact Center notified Doug Herndon, Roof Control Supervisor.\xa0 Herndon notified George Heacock, Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, who in turn assigned Dustin Galloway, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, to investigate the accident.Galloway arrived at the mine and issued a 103(k) order at 9:35 a.m.\xa0 Galloway then traveled to the South dump accident site to conduct the initial on-site investigation.\xa0 Ryan Swaringen, Fire Suppression Technician, with Cintas Corporation, which installed and maintained the fire suppression system on the haul truck, assisted in the examination.On September 10, 2018, Jason Noel, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Surface Specialist, inspected the 2-170 haul truck.On September 11, 2018, Bub Whitfield, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Electrical Specialist, traveled to the mine with Noel to continue the investigation.\xa0 Noel conducted informal interviews.\xa0On September 12, 2018, Whitfield and Noel continued their investigation.\xa0 Chad Barras, Peabody Director of Safety and Compliance, notified MSHA District Manager Ronald W. Burns that Grostefon had died from complications from his injuries.On September 13, 2018, Terry Marshall and Mark Kvitkovich, Mechanical Engineers with MSHA Technical Support, worked with investigators to examine the hydraulic stair on the 2-170 haul truck.On September 19, 2018, formal interviews were conducted at the Bear Run Mine.\xa0 See Appendix A for a list of those interviewed.On September 25, 26, and 27, 2018, Kvitkovich and Michael Hockenberry, Fire Protection Engineer with MSHA Technical Support, worked with investigators to determine the cause of the fire and examine the fire suppression system.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Company Number 2-170 Caterpillar 793C haul truckThe company number 2-170 Caterpillar 793C haul truck, serial number 4AR00300, was manufactured in 1997. \xa0The rigid frame haul truck was placed into service at the mine on April 20, 2010 to haul overburden. \xa0The 240-ton truck was equipped with a 2,166 horsepower Caterpillar diesel engine and had a 24 Volt direct current (VDC) electrical system.\xa0 The mine operator reported the truck had 116,945 operating hours.The mine operator contracted Cintas to install an ANSUL LT-A-101-30 manual fire suppression system on the haul truck on April 21, 2010. \xa0The following year, on August 24, 2011, the mine operator installed a Power Step Inc. electro-hydraulic folding stair assembly (see Appendix B) on the primary egress stairs.Likely Cause of FireThe likely cause of fire was traced to a ruptured steering hose underneath the operator’s cab (see Appendix C). \xa0The hose, which supplied the primary hydraulic pressure from the steering valve to the steering metering pump, had multiple broken steel wire braids in an area about 1-1/2” by 1-1/2”. The interior hose liner also had a hole about 1/8”-inch wide by 1-inch long.\xa0 Investigators were not able to determine why the hose ruptured.According to the manufacturer, pressure in the hose can reach 3,100 psi during steering operations.\xa0 At the time the fire started, the operator would probably have been making a sweeping turn to line up the truck with the dump point location.\xa0 That turn would have provided full pressure to the hose that failed, possibly causing the rupture and allowing high pressure hydraulic fluid to spray onto the hot surfaces of the engine. This would have resulted in a fast-growing fire.Fire Suppression SystemThe fire suppression system consisted of four storage tanks, each capable of holding 30 pounds of multipurpose dry chemical agent.\xa0 The four tanks were mounted on the right side of the truck deck near the engine compartment and were plumbed together to discharge simultaneously when actuated. \xa0The four storage tanks and expellant cartridges received minimal heat damage from the fire.\xa0 \xa0Sixteen fixed discharge nozzles were located around the perimeter of the engine compartment.\xa0\xa0The truck had two manual actuator stations, one in the cab to the right of the truck operator’s seat near the gear console, and one on the front bumper of the truck that was accessible at ground level. To actuate the system, the truck operator would pull a pin and depress the plunger, which would in turn break a foil seal, setting off a burst of pressure through the actuator hoses. The pressure would then cause nitrogen bottles on the chemical storage tanks to discharge, sending fire suppression chemicals to the 16 nozzles and extinguishing the fire.Investigators found that the actuator station in the cab had been used. The safety pin had been pulled and the actuator bottle in the cab had been discharged.\xa0 However, the nitrogen bottles on the chemical storage tanks had not been discharged, and the four storage tanks still contained the proper amount of fire suppression powder.\xa0 When tested, the pneumatic actuators on the storage tanks and the safety relief valve operated properly.The fire suppression system actuation hoses were routed through the engine compartment of the truck and were not sleeved with an extreme temperature heat-resistant fire jacket, contrary to recommendations in the ANSUL Vehicle Fire Suppression and Detection Systems manual. The manual describes the engine compartment as a typical vehicle fire hazard and states, “Do not route actuation hose through fire hazard areas.\xa0 If this cannot be avoided, the hose must be fire jacketed.”The destruction of the actuation hoses in a fire would make the fire suppression system inoperable because the hoses would not be able to transfer pressure from the manual actuators to the actuators on the dry chemical storage tanks. \xa0MSHA’s investigation found that the rubber components (inner and outer hose coverings) in the engine compartment were consumed in the fire.\xa0The investigation noted that the actuator in the cab was near a display screen that provides the truck operator with instructions from the control room.\xa0 Although the plastic components were consumed in the fire, the metal mounting post for the display screen remained intact.\xa0 The screen may have obstructed attempts to strike the manual actuator depending on how the mounting arm was positioned prior to the fire.The manual actuator on the front bumper had not been activated. \xa0The safety pin was still in place and the foil seal was still intact.The fire suppression system included an engine shutdown pressure switch designed to shut down the engine automatically when the system is activated. \xa0Upon inspection, the pressure switch appeared to be in the OFF position, indicating that, at some point during the fire, pressure from the actuation circuit reached it.\xa0 The pressure may have been created when the victim actuated the system, or heat from the fire could have caused the nitrogen actuator cartridge to vent through the foil seal from overpressure. Given these possibilities, and the fact that the actuator cartridge from the cab had been removed and handled by Jeff Wheeler, Production Manager, before the accident was considered reportable, it could not be determined whether the shutdown switch was moved due to pressure from the heat or actions by the victim.Emergency LadderAn alternative egress ladder designed for emergency use was located in front of the operator’s cab.\xa0 Safe access to the ladder required removing a section of handrail that was held to the post by a chain. \xa0The manufacturer recommended using a snap clip to allow easy removal of the chain, so that the ladder could be used quickly in an emergency. \xa0However, in this case the chain was fastened with a screw pin clevis that could not be unfastened by hand. \xa0This condition would impede the ability of the truck operator to use the alternative egress ladder.\xa0 A miner would have to go between the upper hand rail and chain, below the chain or over the handrail to use the alternative egress vertical ladder.Folding StairwayA folding stairway -- Power Step model number TS793C2 -- had been installed to provide safe access to the ground from the end of the primary stairs, which ended more than 5 feet above the ground (see Appendix B). \xa0The electro-hydraulic unit was powered by the truck’s battery and controlled by switches at the top of the stairway and at ground level.\xa0Tests and visual observations of the step assembly concluded that the electro-hydraulic unit itself was functional but the power supply cable had sustained fire damage.\xa0 It is likely that fire damage to the power supply cable caused the unit to malfunction when Grostefon tried to use it.The hydraulic system had an internal leak which allowed the stairs to drift down when not latched, which explains why it was found by investigators in the fully lowered position even though a witness reported that it had been stuck halfway during the accident.\xa0 A manual release intended to lower the folding stairs when electrical power was lost was inoperable because the pull rod was broken off inside the power unit housing.\xa0A fuse that should have been installed inside the haul truck’s battery box to protect the electrical wiring from damage due to excessive current, per the Power Step installation manual, had not been installed.The toggle switch, located at the top of the folding stairs, used to lower and raise the stairs was labeled incorrectly, reversing the up and down functions. \xa0Also, the ground level switch, which was designed to be mounted on the top of the front bumper, was found stuck between the platform frame and the front bumper.Truck Inspections and MaintenanceMaintenance records for the required semi-annual inspection and maintenance of the fire suppression system were reviewed.\xa0 The mine operator contracts a local company, Cintas Fire Protection, to perform the maintenance on all fire suppression systems on the mine site.\xa0 Based on these records, the last three maintenance inspections for the fire suppression system were conducted on July 31, 2017, January 26, 2018 and most recently July 26, 2018.\xa0 No defects were noted in the inspection/maintenance records.The pre-operational inspection conducted by Grostefon at the beginning of his shift on the company number 2-170 haul truck revealed no safety defects.Training and ExperienceOn September 17, 2018, John Dagner, MSHA Training Specialist, reviewed training records and found that Grostefon, who had 1 year of total mining experience, had received training as required by 30 CFR § Part 48.\xa0 However, Grostefon’s Form 5000-23 training records were found to have documentation deficiencies. \xa0A noncontributory 104(a) citation was issued to Peabody Bear Run Mining LLC for a violation of 30 CFR § 48.9(a).', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \xa0Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions which were implemented to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator and Cintas did not ensure the fire suppression system on the Caterpillar 793C haul truck, company number 2-170, was installed and maintained in accordance with manufacturer’s recommendations.Corrective Action:\xa0 The company number 2-170 haul truck has been removed from service.\xa0 The mine operator implemented a written program to ensure ANSUL fire suppression systems on rock trucks are properly installed and maintained.\xa0 In accordance with the program, an ANSUL certified vendor examined these fire suppression systems and all deficiencies are in the process of being repaired.\xa0 Also, manual fire suppression systems will be replaced with automatic fire suppression systems.Additionally, all truck operators were retrained on the proper emergency shut down sequence and operation of the ANSUL LT-A-101-30 dry chemical fire suppression system.\xa0 The mine operator implemented the use of a manual fire suppression actuator simulator and trained all end dump truck operators.\xa0 Also, all miners were retrained in “Leaks 101,” a training course developed by the mine operator on identifying and addressing leaks and/or accumulations that could create a fire hazard.Cintas retrained its technicians who install and maintain the ANSUL LT-A-101-30 fire suppression systems on the Caterpillar 793C haul trucks in the requirements of the ANSUL manual.\xa0 Whenever inspecting, maintaining, or recharging fire suppression systems in the future, Cintas technicians will inform mine operators that MSHA expects the actuation hose to be routed outside the engine compartment or fire-jacketed.\xa0 For all future installations, Cintas will attempt to avoid routing the actuation hose through the engine compartment of this type of vehicle.\xa0 If that cannot reasonably be done due to the configuration of the vehicle, Cintas will install a heat resistant fire jacket (heat shielding) around the actuation hose.\xa0Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not ensure the primary egress stairs and the alternative egress vertical ladder were properly installed and maintained on the Caterpillar 793C haul truck, company number 2-170, to allow miners to escape safely in an emergency situation.Corrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator removed all of the Power Step boarding ladders from the Caterpillar 793 end dumps and replaced them with a fixed boarding ladder that is similar to the one installed by the original equipment manufacturer.\xa0 The mine operator examined all alternative vertical egress ladders on end dumps and repaired/replaced any deficiencies to make sure they are readily accessible as per the original equipment manufacturer’s design.\xa0 The mine operator has trained miners on the installation, maintenance, and preoperational examination of the alternative egress vertical ladder.', 'CONCLUSION': 'On Friday, September 7, 2018, at approximately 3:44 a.m., Robert A. Grostefon, a 60-year-old contract employee with 1 year of total mining experience, was injured after a fire ignited on the Caterpillar 793C haul truck he was operating.\xa0 Grostefon received burns while exiting the cab of the haul truck.\xa0 Grostefon died due to complications from his injuries on September 12, 2018.The likely cause of the fire was a steering hose rupture on the Caterpillar 793C haul truck, company number 2-170, causing hydraulic fluid under high pressure to spray onto hot surfaces of the engine, resulting in a fast-growing fire.\xa0 The mine operator did not ensure the fire suppression system was properly installed and maintained so that it could mitigate the fire as the haul truck operator escaped.\xa0 Additionally, the mine operator did not ensure the primary egress stairs and the alternate egress ladder were properly installed and maintained, impeding Grostefon’s ability to escape the fire.\xa0Approved by:______________________________ \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ________________________Ronald W.

robert a. grostefon reported for work on his normally scheduled night shift.  grostefon was assigned to operate a caterpillar 793c haul truck, hauling overburden.  his travel route for this shift was from the company number 1-195 shovel, located in pit 4, to the north and south ends of the pit 4 dump, a distance of approximately 1 mile.at approximately 3:40 a.m., grostefon drove to the south dump and positioned the truck to dump the load of overburden near the berm of the dump site.  john moreland, bulldozer operator, noticed flames coming from underneath the operator’s cab and wrapping around to the front of the truck as it passed by.  moreland told investigators that he attempted to contact grostefon on the company radio to notify him of the fire, but by then grostefon was already trying to get off the truck.  moreland called out a code red over the company radio to report an equipment fire on the pit 4 south dump site.  a code red is used at the mine to alert miners and the mine’s emergency response crews of an emergency situation. the company dispatch center reported that grostefon’s truck went offline at approximately 3:44 a.m.  the truck likely lost communication due to fire damage to the electrical wiring.according to comments by grostefon during the rescue and in the hospital, as well as testimony from witnesses, grostefon tried twice to actuate the fire suppression system in the cab but it did not activate.  as grostefon exited the left side of the cab, he received burns from flames coming through the grated steel walkway outside, and his polyester shirt caught on fire.  grostefon continued along the grated steel walkway while trying to remove his shirt.  he attempted to use the alternative egress ladder but he could not unfasten a section of handrail that blocked him. he then descended the truck’s main stairs, in front of the engine. the stairs ended at a platform about 5 feet 3 inches above the ground. from there, another set of stairs is usually lowered to the ground using hydraulic power. however, the power step stairs did not fully descend when grostefon tried twice to lower them. he then jumped to the ground.moreland exited the bulldozer and went toward grostefon’s truck. when he saw that gostefon was clear of the fire, he returned to his bulldozer to reposition it out of the way of emergency vehicles.cody faulk, fill-in shift foreman, was at the equipment parking area when he heard moreland announce the code red. he drove to the south dump, calling for a company ambulance over the radio on the way. he told the ambulance crew to go to the intercept 1 point at the pit 4 employee parking lot.faulk arrived at the accident site about 2 to 3 minutes after hearing the code red.  he saw grostefon bent over with his shirt lying on the ground.  grostefon got in faulk’s pickup truck and they moved away from the fire.  after moreland also got in the truck, faulk drove to the intercept 1 point.  tyler potts, senior lead shot firer, followed faulk’s truck to the intercept 1 point.when the group arrived at the intercept 1 point, grostefon was transferred to the company ambulance driven by matt plano, preparation plant electrician. moreland, potts, and plano, all members of the surface mine emergency team (smet), treated grostefon’s burns by irrigating them with saline and applying burn gel bandages.  grostefon had burns on his head, back, and arms.  the smet team assessed them as 2nd degree burns.josh damron, water truck operator, arrived at the scene of the accident 4 to 5 minutes after hearing the code red over the company radio.  damron extinguished the fire in approximately 5 minutes, using the water cannon on the truck.  damron then repositioned the water truck to spray water on the left front tire to help cool it.  an additional company water truck and a volunteer fire crew from dugger, indiana arrived on scene to assist.the sullivan county ambulance team arrived at 4:23 a.m. and took over grostefon’s care. grostefon was taken to terre haute regional hospital in terre haute, indiana.  after his injuries were assessed, he was transferred to eskenazi burn center in indianapolis, indiana.  grostefon died from complications from his injuries after five days of treatment.  he was pronounced dead on september 12, 2018, at 7:12 p.m."

District Manager', '\nOVERVIEW\nOn August 22, 2018, Brent D. Cosner, a 29-year old Groundman with 1 year of experience, died while attempting to clean a buildup of material from a rotating conveyor bend pulley. Cosner was standing on an aerial lift and manually scraping the conveyor bend pulley with a 15-inch pry bar, when he became entangled between the bend pulley and the moving conveyor belt.\nThe accident occurred because the conveyor was not de-energized, locked out or blocked against hazardous motion before the victim attempted to clean the bend pulley. Mine management did not provide appropriate task training to the victim on the hazards associated with the work being performed.\n': '', '\nGENERAL INFORMATION\nHaines & Kibblehouse Inc. owns and operates Birdsboro Materials, a surface trap rock mine, located in Birdsboro, Berks County, Pennsylvania. John B. Haines IV, President, is the principal official and Jason A. Galli, Superintendent, is in charge of health and safety at the mine. The mine operates seven days a week with two 12-hour shifts per day. The mine’s total employment is 30 miners.\nBirdsboro Materials drills and blasts trap rock from a multi-bench quarry and uses wheeled loaders to load haul trucks, which feed the processing operation. The material is crushed, screened, and separated into various sizes. The mine sells the finished product to the construction industry.\nThe Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed its last regular inspection of the operation on January 22, 2018.\nDESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT\nOn August 22, 2018, Brent D. Cosner (victim) began work at 5:45 p.m. He met with Christopher J. Magill, Night Shift Foreman, who verbally provided a list of tasks to be completed at the secondary plant. At approximately 6:00 p.m., Cosner began using a high pressure hose to wash out accumulated material from underneath the Trio crusher. He then shoveled spillage away from the Red No. 2 conveyor and used a high pressure hose to wash out material from underneath the 8-foot by 24-foot screen deck. Prior to taking his lunch break, Cosner stopped for approximately 30\xa0minutes to help Magill remove screens from the portable power screen near the secondary plant.\nMatthew D. Bachman, Secondary Plant Operator (Night Shift), observed Cosner with a grease gun walking along the No. 7 1B transfer conveyor catwalk. Magill and Bachman believed Cosner was completing one of his assigned tasks, which included greasing the plant equipment. At approximately 11:30\xa0p.m., Paul D. Pavelick, Front-end Loader Operator (Night Shift), observed someone moving the mobile aerial lift toward the No. 3 tunnel conveyor belt. From his vantage point, Pavelick could not determine who was moving the lift. At approximately 11:45 p.m., Cosner used the aerial lift to access the take-up assembly of the No. 3 tunnel belt conveyor and became entangled between the rotating smooth drum take-up west bend pulley and the moving conveyor belt. There were no eyewitnesses to the accident since the other four miners were performing their assigned duties in different locations of the mine: Magill was working at the primary plant; Bachman was at the 1B stockpile checking the product for oversized stones; Pavelick was operating a front-end loader repairing haul roads on the south side of the mine away from the plant; and Christopher M. Flounders, Wash Plant Operator (Night Shift), was at the wash plant.\nBachman, the closest miner to the No. 3 tunnel belt conveyor (approximately 500 feet away), heard two loud screams and immediately ran toward them. When he arrived at the No.\xa03 tunnel conveyor, he observed a person caught in the take-up bend pulley with the conveyor belt still in operation. Bachman ran to the electrical room and de-energized the secondary plant. Bachman called Magill, who immediately ran to the area, and both men ran up the conveyor catwalk to the take-up area. Moments later, Flounders arrived at the scene and ran up the catwalk to provide assistance. Magill yelled to Cosner and reached through the conveyor structure and shook him, but he was unresponsive. At 11:54 p.m., Bachman placed a call to 911. At approximately 11:59 p.m., Jonathan Huber, Emergency Medical Technician from the Southern Berks EMS, arrived at the scene. Huber checked for vital signs but found none. Cosner was transported to Reading Hospital and Medical Center in Reading, Pennsylvania, where he was pronounced dead. The final Autopsy Pathology Report stated the primary cause of the victim’s death was asphyxia due to mechanical compression of the thorax with other significant contributing factors of blunt force head trauma and methamphetamine intoxication.\nINVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT\nJason A. Galli, Superintendent, called the Department of Labor’s National Contact Center (DOLNCC) at 12:41 a.m. on August 23, 2018, and notified MSHA of the accident. DOLNCC notified Victor C. Lescznske, Supervisory Special Investigator, via the Northeastern District’s emergency cell phone. MSHA issued an order under provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to ensure safety of the miners\nMSHA’s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident site, interviewed miners, and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident. MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and miners.\nDISCUSSION\nLocation of Accident\nThe accident occurred at the take-up assembly of the No. 3 tunnel belt conveyor located at the secondary plant. The victim was entangled between the rotating west bend pulley and the moving conveyor belt.\nWeather\nWeather reports on the day of the accident indicated clear skies with an average temperature of 68˚F and a relative humidity of 84 percent. Investigators did not consider weather to be a factor in the accident\nEquipment Involved\nAerial Lift: The aerial lift used by the victim was a Model JLG 600S telescopic boom lift manufactured by JLG Industries, Inc. in 2004. With the boom extended, the maximum working height is 66 feet with a continuous 360˚ swing. The personnel basket included a 3-foot by 8-foot solid working platform completely surrounded by a handrail, mid-rail and toe boards. The victim accessed the basket through a slide bar, side entry, inward swinging, self-closing gate. The platform capacity is rated as 500 pounds. At the time of the accident, the aerial lift basket was positioned approximately 36 feet above the ground. The victim was not wearing fall protection and was found entangled and suspended outside of the perimeter of the working platform handrails.\nNo. 3 Tunnel Belt Conveyor: The conveyor system was designed, manufactured and installed by Kemper Equipment Inc. at another mining operation owned by the operator in 2004. In 2005, the operator relocated and installed the conveyor system at its present location. The overall structure is 270 feet long with a 36-inch wide belt. The conveyor take-up section consists of two smooth drum bend pulleys (east and west) and a weighted, 16-inch diameter face winged take-up pulley. The victim was found entangled between the rotating west bend pulley and the moving conveyor belt.\nThe victim used the aerial lift to access the No. 3 tunnel belt conveyor take-up assembly to clean the west side bend pulley with a 15-inch pry bar. The victim did not de-energize, lock out, and block the conveyor against motion prior to performing this task.\nDuring the investigation, mine management stated the proper way to clean a buildup of material from a take-up bend pulley while the conveyor is in operation is to use a high pressure water hose from the conveyor catwalk and spray through the associated guarding. Reportedly, a hose is pulled up to the adjacent catwalk using a rope and tied to the handrail prior to directing the spray toward the conveyor component. Investigators identified a water hose located within 23\xa0feet of the accident location. Mine management could not provide documentation the victim was task trained in this remote cleaning procedure.\nTRAINING AND EXPERIENCE\nBrent D. Cosner worked at Birdsboro Materials for 1 year, 17 weeks and 5 days. A representative of MSHA’s Educational Field and Small Mines Services (EFSMS) staff conducted a review of the mine operator’s training plan and records. In April 2017, Cosner completed 17 hours of training as part of his new miner training and completed an additional 1.5 hours later that year. In December 2017, he received 8 hours of annual refresher training. The investigators found no documentation indicating he received task training to be a groundman or laborer and no training in the operation of the secondary plant and conveyor maintenance. All of this task training would have covered critical components of his regular job duties. Cosner did, however, receive task training to operate an aerial lift, a backhoe and a skid steer loader in 2017 and 2018. EFSMS determined Mr. Cosner did not receive all of the required training according to 30 CFR Part 46, including 24-hour new miner training (30 CFR § 46.5) and task training (30 CFR § 46.7(a)).\nThe accident investigation team reviewed all of the miners’ training records and noted discrepancies in the records. Many of the miners were assigned work duties prior to receiving required Part 46 training. MSHA issued noncontributory citations during an E16 Spot Inspection for these violations.\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS\nThe accident investigation team conducted a root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the accident. The team identified the following root causes and the corresponding corrective actions implemented to prevent a recurrence.\nRoot Cause: Management did not establish policies and procedures to ensure proper cleaning of the conveyor components at the mine, including the take-up bend pulleys on the No. 3 tunnel belt conveyor.\nCorrective Action: Management installed self-cleaning wing bend pulleys and two belt scrapers to remove build-up on the return side of the belts prior to reaching the bend pulleys. The mine operator established and implemented a written policy outlining the proper procedures for cleaning conveyor components. All miners responsible for cleaning conveyor components were trained in the new policy and procedures.\nRoot Cause: The No. 3 Tunnel Belt Conveyor was not de-energized, locked out, or blocked against hazardous motion prior to the victim performing a maintenance task (manually cleaning the take-up bend pulley).\nCorrective Action: Management had a maintenance checklist for employees’ use prior to performing maintenance tasks on plant machinery, which included the requirement to lock out and tag out the various components. After the accident, management instituted a formal Repair Order Lock Out / Tag Out policy and trained all miners in its requirements, which included blocking critical components.\nRoot Cause: Management did not provide all of the required 30 CFR Part 46 training to the victim who was hired as a new miner.\nCorrective Action: To address training deficiencies found and cited during the E16 Spot Inspection, the operator has revised the training plan and provided additional training to employees, as needed.\nCONCLUSION\nBrent D. Cosner died while attempting to manually clean a buildup of material from a conveyor take-up bend pulley. The accident occurred because the conveyor was not de-energized, locked out or blocked against hazardous motion prior to cleaning the pulley. Mine management did not provide appropriate task training to the victim so he understood the hazards associated with the work being performed.\n': '', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'Order No. 4724341 – Issued on August 23, 2018, under the provisions of section 103(k) of the Mine Act.A fatal accident occurred at this operation on August 23, 2018 when a miner\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0became entangled in the #3 tunnel belt take up roller.

Thomsen stated that he explained to Fernandez how to uncouple the railcars and how to set the manual handbrake, but did not instruct Fernandez to set the manual handbrakes on the two railcars, and Thomsen did not set the manual handbrakes himself. \xa0Thomsen climbed into a Rail King 300 Trackmobile coupled to the number one car and left Fernandez to uncouple the number five rail car, approximately 250 feet away. \xa0Thomsen stated Fernandez motioned him by hand to pull the three railcars.\xa0 Thomsen began to pull the railcars. \xa0He looked out the side window and saw the two uncoupled railcars (numbers five and six) rolling down the spur, but could not see Fernandez. \xa0Thomsen stopped the train, ran down the track, found Fernandez lying between the tracks and called 911.\nEmiliano Gonzales, Plant Operator, saw Fernandez stationed at the uncoupling lever (between the fourth and fifth railcars) from the second level of the plant. \xa0Gonzales stated he went into the office and upon coming back out a few minutes later, he observed Fernandez on the front of the sixth railcar attempting to set the manual handbrake. \xa0At approximately 9:20 a.m., Gonzales stated he observed Fernandez being struck by the number six car and ejected from under the number five car. \xa0Gonzales used his plant radio to advise management in an “all call” that they needed an ambulance. \xa0David Taft, Maintenance Leadman, heard the radio call and proceeded to the area where he observed Fernandez lying between the tracks and also called 911. \xa0Two additional contract\n': '', ""\nemployees, Dawson Barber, Loader Operator (Stout Excavating), and Jason Kieffer, Project Superintendent (Market and Johnson), were located on the west end of the property at the time of the accident and observed Fernandez riding on the front of the number six railcar, attempting to set the manual handbrake. \xa0Both stated that the victim either slipped or attempted to jump off the runaway railcars.\xa0 Kieffer stated that when he arrived at the accident scene, Fernandez was unresponsive.\xa0 Kieffer checked for vital signs but could not feel a pulse.\xa0 Taft and Thomsen began first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on the victim as other miners arrived to assist.\xa0 John Ortega Jr., Chief Investigator for Bexar County Fire Marshall, happened to be on the mine site.\xa0 He arrived on the scene and continued CPR, but the victim remained unresponsive.\xa0 Bexar County Emergency Service District arrived at 9:37 a.m. and took control of the scene. \xa0Fernandez was air lifted to University Hospital in San Antonio, Texas.\xa0 The Bexar County Medical Examiner’s Office personnel pronounced his death at 10:51 a.m.\nINVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT\nNathan Estep, Environmental Safety and Health Manager, called the Department of Labor National Contact Center (DOLNCC) at 9:30 a.m. on June 23, 2018, and notified MSHA of the accident.\xa0 Inspectors Lance Miller, David Tijerina and Brett Barrick (Lead Investigator) were dispatched to the mine site to secure the scene. \xa0MSHA issued an order under provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to ensure the safety of the miners and began the investigation.\n\xa0MSHA's accident investigation team conducted a physical examination of the accident, interviewed 10 mine employees and contractors, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident. \xa0MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and miners.\nDISCUSSION\nThe accident occurred on the south section of the company owned rail spur. \xa0The spur enters the mine from a Union Pacific mainline on the west side of the plant. \xa0The overall length of the south section is approximately 1,680 feet. \xa0The accident occurred approximately 533 feet from the Union Pacific mainline.\xa0 The runaway cars traveled approximately 586 feet from the point where they were uncoupled to where they were derailed by a Union Pacific owned derailer. \xa0The two loaded cars passed over and destroyed a Hayes EBX #6 derailer that had been placed on the track by the mine operator at approximately 102 feet from the railcar’s original point of origin.\xa0 On March 2, 2018 this mine operator experienced a separate event where a railcar ran away and damaged the mines derailer. The Hayes EBX #6 derailer was installed in approximately the same location by a contractor after that incident. \xa0\n"": 'Investigators estimate Fernandez rode the front of the number six car for approximately 321 feet before slipping or jumping and getting struck by the railcars. \xa0The track’s overall grade is approximately 3.5 percent and the railcars were traveling at approximately 18 miles per hour when Fernandez slipped or jumped from the railcar.WeatherThe weather at the time of the accident was clear, with calm winds, and a temperature of 88 degrees Fahrenheit. \xa0Investigators did not consider weather to be a factor in the accident.Equipment Involved in the AccidentThe number five and six railcars involved in the accident are both manufactured by Trinity Rail and were on lease to the mine. \xa0They are identified as TILX 338893 and TILX 338815. The railcars are 41’ 10” long, 10’ 8” wide and 15’ 4” tall with an empty weight of 53,000 pounds. \xa0On the date of the accident, each car contained approximately 200,000 pounds of dry sand. \xa0The railcars are equipped with both air and mechanical braking systems.\xa0Training and ExperienceRodney Fernandez had been employed at San Antonio Plant for 10 weeks and 3 days and had no previous mining or rail experience. \xa0Fernandez was in the process of being task trained on maintenance activities in the plant. \xa0This training did not include rail training.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'A root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified:Root Cause: \xa0The accident occurred because the operator did not block or set the manual handbrakes to prevent uncontrolled movement of the two railcars.Corrective Action:\xa0 The operator will retrain miners on its policy for blocking or setting manual handbrakes on railcars to prevent their movement prior to being uncoupled.Root Cause:\xa0 The operator did not ensure the victim received new task training for work that he had no previous experience performing.Corrective Action:\xa0 The operator will provide new task training to miners who are assigned to a task in which they have no previous experience.', 'CONCLUSION': 'The victim climbed on to a set of moving railcars in order to set the manual handbrake. After setting the manual handbrake, the victim slipped or attempted to jump from the railcar but was struck and died from his injuries. This accident occurred because the victim had not been trained in the task of moving railcars and was not instructed to block or set the manual handbrake. In addition, the operator did not ensure that the railcars were blocked or the manual handbrakes were set prior to movement of the railcars.', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'Order No. 9405608 – Issued on June 23, 2018, under the provision of the section 103(k) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977:A fatal accident occurred at this operation on June 23, 2018, when two miners were attempting to move rail cars on the spur track.

At 11:40 a.m., he stopped at the mine office and reported to Sara King, Dispatcher, he could not find Perez.King immediately notified Rachel of the concern and Rachel along with Martin Perez, Lead Person (the victim’s son), went to the location on the haul road where Bass and Sowers found the spilled material.\xa0 Rachel and Martin Perez concluded the truck must have traveled over the berm and entered the impoundment.', 'INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT': 'Mike Rachel, Plant Manager, called the MSHA Dallas District office at 12:00 p.m. stating a miner was missing and possibly submerged in a water impoundment. At 12:02 p.m. Rachel called 911 dispatch to report the accident. At 12:16 p.m., Tommy Fitzgerald, Mine Safety and Health Inspector, was dispatched to the scene to collect information and witness statements. David Hamm, Dallas District Safety Specialist was assigned lead investigator and dispatched to the scene.Rachel later called the Department of Labor National Contact Center at 1:17 p.m. Fitzgerald arrived at the mine at 3:05 p.m. and discovered a very large group of first responders, police and on lookers at the scene. Divers had entered the water and located Perez unrestrained inside of the haul truck cab. Once Inspector Fitzgerald established they had located the missing miner, he issued a 103(k) order to the mine operator under the provisions of the Mine Act to ensure the safety of miners, preserve the scene and to begin the investigation.On August 15, 2018, an MSHA Technical Support Mechanical Engineer examined the truck after the operator removed it from the impoundment. Technical Support, with assistance from VOLVO Product Assurance Engineering and ROMCO Equipment Company, determined the haul truck had been operating properly. The examiners discovered several mechanical defects such as: the audible low air pressure alarm had been disabled; the accumulators for both front and rear service brake circuits failed the accumulator test specified by Volvo’s service manual; and both the front and rear service, brake circuits had hydraulic components that were leaking which allowed both accumulators circuits to lose hydraulic pressure without cycling the brakes. However, none of these defects would have contributed to the accident.', 'DISCUSSION': 'The haul road from the pit to the plant is approximately one and a half miles long, with several curves in the road.\xa0 The haul road has posted “control speeds to road conditions” signs, but there were no posted speed limits.\xa0 The haul truck drivers interviewed stated twenty to twenty five miles per hour was a safe operating speed based on roadway conditions on the day of the accident. Sowers stated he had observed Perez driving over thirty miles per hour in the past.\xa0 The haul road is well maintained with no obstacles.\xa0 The operator provided and maintained mid axle high berms along the haul road next to a 9.5 acre water pond. \xa0The haul road parallels the impoundment for about half of a mile.\xa0 Where the truck entered the impoundment, the road narrowed from 40 feet to 35 feet and made a 30 degree turn with no obstructions restricting any views in the curve.Weather ConditionsWeather condition were hot and dry.\xa0 There were no visibility restrictions and no rain on the day of the accident.Equipment involved in the accidentThe vehicle involved in the accident was a 2006 Volvo A40D haul truck.\xa0 In early April 2018, the mine operator reported the brakes locked up on the rear axle to ROMCO Equipment Company to evaluate the problem.\xa0 The brake and rear axle inspection did not indicate any deficiencies.\xa0 The truck was put back in service on June 7, 2018, with all systems working properly.Training and experienceAll haul truck drivers, including the victim, were properly trained and had received their annual refresher on February 10, 2018.\xa0 Perez received New Miner Training on February 10, 2015, and he was task trained to drive the Volvo A40D haul truck on July 20, 2015.', 'CONCLUSION': 'Aurelio Perez Sr. drowned when the haul truck he was operating left the road and traveled over a berm and entered a water impoundment.\xa0 There were no eye witnesses to the accident and, based on the investigation, investigators were unable to determine why the driver was unable to maintain control of the haul truck.', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'Order No. 9403461 was issued on June 13, 2018, under the provisions of Section 103(k) of The Mine Act:On June 13, 2018 a 103(K) order 9403461, was issued in accordance with the 1977 Mine Act to assure the safety of all persons at this operation and to prevent and destruction of any evidence which would assist in investigating the cause or causes of the accident.\xa0\xa0\xa0Approved: __________________________ Date _________________________\xa0 \xa0Michael A.

A green light on the RFID indicates the scanner read the card.\xa0 To avoid striking the driver’s side mirror against the scanner, it appears Rodriguez stopped his truck too far away to reach the RFID from inside of the cab.\xa0 Investigators believe Rodriguez unbuckled his seat belt and opened the driver’s side door while pressing the clutch pedal with his right foot.\xa0 Investigators believe Rodriguez leaned out of the truck with the truck in gear and his right foot slipped off the clutch, causing the truck to move forward.\xa0 The sudden forward motion threw Rodriguez from the truck, and the truck’s rear wheels ran over him.Angela Worrell, scale house attendant, heard a loud noise, looked through the scale house window and saw a truck on the side of the road near the RFID.\xa0 Worrell went to the scale house door and saw someone under the belly dump portion of the truck.\xa0 Worrell called for help on a hand-held radio and then travelled to the accident scene.\xa0 Bryan Payne, customer truck driver, was sitting in his truck on the scales and saw Worrell running to Rodriquez’s truck.\xa0 Payne exited his truck and noticed the victim’s truck was still running and in gear with no one in the cab.\xa0 Payne put Rodriguez’s truck gear in the “park” position.\xa0 David Parks, loader operator, heard Worrell’s radio transmission and travelled to the scene.\xa0 According to Parks’s interview, Rodriguez had no pulse. \xa0Parks began cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but Rodriquez did not respond.\xa0 Robert Jones, dredge operator, arrived to relieve Parks with chest compressions while Parks prepared the emergency defibrillator.\xa0 Liberty County Emergency Medical Services and the sheriff’s department arrived at the accident scene at 8:58 a.m., and county responders attended the victim.\xa0 Cody Parrish, Liberty County justice of the peace, pronounced Rodriguez dead at the scene.\xa0 The cause of death was later determined to be “blunt force injuries.”\xa0INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT\nJohn Worrell, plant manager, called the Department of Labor National Contact Center (DOLNCC) at 8:40 a.m. on April 12, 2018, and notified MSHA of the accident.\xa0 DOLNCC notified William O’dell, assistant district manager in MSHA’s South Central District.\xa0 MSHA issued an order under provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to ensure the safety of the miners, and the agency started the investigation.\xa0MSHA's accident investigation team travelled to the mine, conducted a physical examination of the accident, conducted eighteen interviews with mine employees and customer truck drivers, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident.\xa0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, miners, customer truck drivers, and owners of the truck involved in the accident.\xa0DISCUSSION\nLocation of the AccidentThe accident occurred at the customer RFID, which is located on the road adjacent to the scale house, on the south side of the primary sand plant.\xa0 The victim stopped the truck as it faced north on relatively dry, level and stable sand.Weather The weather service reported the weather at the time of the accident as clear, with calm winds and a temperature of 52 degrees Fahrenheit. Investigators did not consider weather to be a factor in the accident.Truck/Trailer Information The accident involved a 2007 Freightliner tractor with a belly dump semi-trailer.\xa0 The tractor and trailer combination is commonly used on public highways in this region.Training and ExperienceManuel G. Rodriguez had 20 years of experience driving an over-the-road tractor trailer truck combination.\xa0 For the last two years, Rodriguez picked up material at this mine site and transported it to end users.\xa0 Trinity Materials provided driving policy and procedure training to customer truck drivers, and the training included traffic controls at the mine site and personal safety.\xa0 Trinity Materials required customer truck drivers to report to the office/scale house or point of contact prior to starting work.Apex Express RFID Card ReaderRFID cards are used to identify trucks when entering or leaving the site. The software allows the mine operator to track the sale of materials.\xa0ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS\nInvestigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified a root cause.Root Cause:\xa0 The accident occurred because the victim did not properly secure the truck by setting the park brake and taking the vehicle out of gear before opening the door and leaning out of the cab.\xa0Corrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator has discontinued the use of the RFID system and in the future will be using handheld and CB radios for communications with customer truck drivers. Site specific training now includes instructions to visitors advising them to set park brakes and place equipment in the park position prior to leaving the operator’s cab.\xa0CONCLUSION\nWhile attempting to scan a customer card on the operator’s RFID, Manuel G. Rodriguez fell from the cab of his truck and the rear wheels ran over him.\xa0 The accident occurred because the victim did not properly secure the truck from movement.\xa0\xa0\xa0Approved: ______________________________\xa0\xa0 Date: _______________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Michael A.

Cotton, Acting District Manager', 'OVERVIEW': 'On Wednesday, March 28, 2018, at approximately 2:15 a.m., Hubert Grubbs Jr., a 29-year-old Belt Foreman with 8 years of mining experience, was fatally injured when a conveyor belt on which he was working started unexpectedly.\xa0 Grubbs became entangled in the conveyor belt clamp ratchet chain and was fatally injured when the conveyor belt started.\xa0 At the time of the accident, Grubbs and a coworker were splicing the conveyor belt.The accident occurred because the operator allowed employees to engage in repair and maintenance work on a conveyor belt without implementing proper lock-out and tag-out procedures to ensure the electrical power was off.\xa0 The conveyor belt started because a mine examiner improperly repaired a remote cable and belt switch wires, which he had damaged during his examination. \xa0The mine examiner had not been trained to repair this electrical circuit.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'The Blackjewel, L.L.C., D-11 Panther Mine, ID No. 15-18198, is an underground coal mine located near Cumberland, Harlan County, Kentucky.\xa0 The mine started producing coal from the Owl coal seam on September 1, 1999.\xa0 The mining height is 5⅓ feet and the mine is accessed by one main portal location.\xa0 At the time of the accident, the mine employed 56 underground miners and 3 surface miners.\xa0 The mine produces coal on two production shifts, five to six days per week.\xa0 Maintenance is performed on the third shift.The mine uses two mechanized mining units (MMUs), and produces an average of 1,600 tons of raw coal per day.\xa0 Coal is mined with continuous mining machines and transported to the surface on 48-inch wide conveyor belts and hauled away from the mine by trucks.\xa0 Rubber-tired diesel equipment is used to transport miners and supplies underground.The mine is ventilated by an exhaust mine fan.\xa0 The last air sample on January 31, 2018, showed that the mine produced no measureable amount of methane in a 24 hour period.\xa0 The principal officers for Blackjewel, L.L.C. at the time of the accident were:Jeffery A. Hoops....................................................................................... PresidentDavid Runyon................................................................................... Vice-PresidentThe last regular safety and health inspection (E01) was completed on March 20, 2018.\xa0 The mine’s non-fatal days lost (NFDL) incidence rate for 2017 was 4.09 compared to the national average of 3.66 for mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On Tuesday, March 27, 2018, Anthony Boggs, Mine Foreman, gave Grubbs; Travis Saylor, Mine Examiner; and Josh Fuller, Section Foreman, their work assignments on the Section 004 MMU.\xa0 The miners were working the third shift that started at 10:30 p.m.\xa0 One of Grubb’s duties was to replace the bad conveyor belt splice on the No. 7 conveyor belt.At 10:00 p.m., Saylor began to conduct a pre-shift examination of mine seals, located about 1,050 feet away from the main portal.\xa0 This examination is required to be completed before other third shift miners are allowed to enter the mine.\xa0 After completing this examination, Saylor returned to the surface area of the main portal.At approximately 10:30 p.m., Fuller and seven section maintenance crew members – Keaton Dillman, Scoop Operator; Gary Kirby, Roof Bolter; James Brown, Scoop Operator; Brent Raleigh, Roof Bolter; Donnie Burton, Continuous Mining Machine Operator; and Johnny Ray and Richard Baker, Electricians – traveled to the section in a personnel carrier.\xa0 They arrived at the section at about 11:45 p.m. and began their assigned tasks.\xa0 Tim Combs, Electrician, arrived at the section at 1:00 a.m.Grubbs and James Belt, Scoop Operator/Outby General Laborer, who was assigned to work with Grubbs to replace the bad conveyor belt splice on the No. 7 conveyor belt, waited on the mine surface for a personnel carrier to take them into the mine.\xa0 At 12:28 a.m., a carrier became available and they entered the mine.\xa0 On their way to the No. 7 conveyor belt, they stopped at the No. 1 conveyor belt to check previous splices and the No. 2 conveyor belt to gather splicing tools and materials.At 11:43 p.m., Saylor reentered the mine to conduct on-shift examinations of all mine conveyor belts.\xa0 His plan was to start with the No. 1 conveyor belt and work his way to the No. 12 conveyor belt.\xa0 All conveyor belts were running at this time.\xa0 He stopped at the No. 7 conveyor belt head drive at crosscut 128 to take his lunch break. \xa0Grubbs and Belt arrived while Saylor was eating lunch.\xa0 While Saylor and Grubbs talked, Belt adjusted the take-up at the No. 7 conveyor belt head drive to prepare for the conveyor belt splice.Grubbs and Belt then traveled inby to crosscut 142 of the No. 7 conveyor belt entry to replace the bad conveyor belt splice.\xa0 Belt stopped the conveyor belt switch by using a belt switch located at crosscut 141 and positioned the splice at approximately 38 feet away from the center of crosscut 142.\xa0 Grubbs and Belt worked together to secure the conveyor belt clamps on both ends of the splice.\xa0 Once the conveyor belt clamps were secured, Grubbs and Belt used two chain ratchets in conjunction with the conveyor belt clamps to pull slack in the conveyor belt.\xa0 They then removed the splice by cutting between the clamps.\xa0 Belt planned to install new \xa0splicing materials to the outby end of the conveyor belt, and Grubbs would then do the same to the inby end.Belt completed the outby end of the conveyor belt splice.\xa0 Grubbs knelt on the bottom conveyor belt to start installing the inby side of the conveyor belt splice.\xa0 Belt was handing tools and supplies to Grubbs across the beltline.Meanwhile, Saylor finished his lunch at the No. 7 conveyor belt head drive and traveled inby along the conveyor belt entry to continue his examination.\xa0 At crosscut 135, the clearance between the conveyor belt and the rib narrowed.\xa0 Saylor’s personnel carrier got stuck on the outby corner of the block of coal, causing the rear wheel to lose contact with the mine floor.\xa0 Saylor placed a bottom roller hanger and rocks under the wheels to regain traction.\xa0 When he maneuvered to regain traction, the personnel carrier pulled apart the conveyor belt switch wires where a splice had been made to connect the wires to the remote cable.\xa0 Saylor decided to repair the switch wires and remote cable by splicing the matching colors of the wires and remote cable together.\xa0 This inadvertently started the No. 7 conveyor belt at about 2:15 a.m.As the conveyor belt began to move, Grubbs became entangled in one of the loose ends of a ratchet chain used as part of the clamping process and was dragged over the top troughing rollers.\xa0 Belt saw Grubbs being pulled by the belt and immediately crossed under the conveyor belt, jumped onto the personnel carrier, and headed toward the head drive to disconnect power to the No. 7 conveyor belt.Still at crosscut 135, Saylor heard a noise, which he surmised was from a bad conveyor belt splice. \xa0The noise became louder and sounded more like the conveyor belt was broken and was contacting the troughing rollers.\xa0 He saw reflective material on the conveyor belt and realized that something was wrong. \xa0He instinctively flipped the conveyor belt switch in the opposite direction, but the conveyor belt did not immediately stop.\xa0 Saylor then pulled apart the conveyor belt switch wires he had just spliced.\xa0 The portion of the conveyor belt where Grubbs was located coasted to a stop at crosscut 135.\xa0 The belt had traveled a total of about 585 feet (see Appendix B) with Grubbs on it.\xa0Saylor observed that Grubbs was seriously injured, but was conscious and talking. \xa0Saylor ran into the adjacent roadway and used his cap light to signal for help.\xa0 Belt saw Saylor in the roadway and continued to crosscut 135 where Grubbs was located. \xa0He remained with Grubbs while Saylor drove to the nearest mine phone located approximately 630 feet away.\xa0 At about 2:20 a.m., Saylor called Dallas Halcomb, Dispatcher, and directed him to contact emergency services and notify appropriate federal and state officials of the accident.\xa0 Saylor also asked Halcomb to ask all miners on the section to come to the accident scene and bring first aid supplies.\xa0 Saylor traveled back to assist Belt in freeing Grubbs.Halcomb contacted local emergency services for an ambulance, and at 2:27 a.m. called the Department of Labor National Contact Center (Contact Center) to report the accident. \xa0He also called Mike Dempsey, Mine Superintendent.Anthony Boggs, Mine Foreman, entered the mine at 1:32 a.m., arriving on the section at 2:26 a.m.\xa0 Soon after arriving, he learned about the accident from Halcomb.\xa0 Boggs then told Fuller, who was also an emergency medical technician, about the accident and ordered some of the crew to gather first aid supplies and travel to the accident site.\xa0 At 2:30 a.m., Boggs and Fuller, as well as crew members Dillman, Kirby, Brown, Combs, and Raleigh, traveled to the accident site.\xa0 Three other miners, Burton, Ray, and Baker, remained on the section.While waiting for help to arrive, Saylor and Belt continued their efforts to free Grubbs from the conveyor belt and ratchet chains.\xa0 Belt took measures to control his bleeding, while Saylor traveled to the power center and disconnected the plug for the No. 7 conveyor belt drive and take-up.\xa0 He also began clearing all supplies out of his personnel carrier so Grubbs could be transported out of the mine.\xa0 During this time, Grubbs remained conscious and was talking.At about 2:50 a.m., Boggs, Fuller and the other crew members from the section arrived at the accident scene.\xa0 Fuller conducted a medical assessment of Grubbs, while the miners worked together to remove Grubbs from the conveyor belt structure and ratchet chain.\xa0 By this time, Grubbs had stopped talking but still had a pulse and was breathing. \xa0The miners placed Grubbs on a backboard and onto a personnel carrier to be transported to the surface.\xa0 Kirby drove the personnel carrier, while Fuller and Brown continued to treat Grubbs’ injuries. \xa0Belt was also with Grubbs, stabilizing his spine.\xa0 Boggs, Saylor, Dillman, Combs, and Raleigh followed in separate personnel carriers.At about 3:05 a.m., Grubbs stopped breathing.\xa0 Fuller checked for a pulse but found none and immediately began cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), which he continued until they reached the surface at approximately 3:15 a.m.\xa0 Grubbs was placed in the waiting ambulance by members of the TranStar Emergency Medical Service (EMS).Moments later, an EMS crew member notified the surrounding miners that Grubbs did not survive.\xa0 EMS personnel contacted their dispatcher to request the coroner to travel to the mine.\xa0 Philip Bianchi, Harlan County Coroner, arrived at the mine at approximately 4:20 a.m.\xa0 Bianchi recorded 3:17 a.m. as the time of death.', 'INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT': 'After receiving Halcomb’s call that a miner had been injured in a conveyor belt accident, the Contact Center contacted Russel Weekly, Birmingham Field Office (FO) Supervisor. \xa0Weekly notified Marvin Hoskins, Hazard FO Supervisor, of the accident.\xa0 Hoskins sent James Daniels, Hazard FO Coal Mine Inspector (CMI), to the mine to issue a 103(k) order.\xa0 Daniels issued the order at 4:00 a.m.Hoskins contacted Samuel R. Creasy, Acting District Manager, and Creasy assigned Jack E. Harris, Barbourville FO CMI, as the lead accident investigator.\xa0 Creasy also directed Sean G. Davenport, Electrical Inspector, to assist in the investigation and Kevin D. Bruner, Sr., Barbourville FO Supervisor, to act as the family liaison.\xa0 Creasy, Harris, Davenport, and Bruner traveled separately to the mine to begin the accident investigation.\xa0 Harris arrived at 6:15 a.m. and the others arrived shortly afterward.\xa0 Accident investigators from the Kentucky Division of Mine Safety (KDMS) were at the mine and participated in the investigation.After being briefed by Daniels, investigators from MSHA and KDMS jointly conducted informal interviews of the miners.\xa0 Creasy, Harris, Davenport, and Bruner then traveled underground to the accident scene with representatives of the mine operator and KDMS investigators.\xa0 They took \xa0photographs and pertinent measurements.Deborah B. Combs, Educational Field and Small Mine Service’s Training Specialist, traveled to the mine to review training records and the company’s training plan on March 28, 2018.MSHA conducted formal interviews on March 30, 2018, at the MSHA Harlan FO. \xa0See Appendix A for a list of those that were interviewed.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Mine Operator MaintenanceThe mine operator conducted mine maintenance on the third shift, beginning at 10:30 p.m. and ending at 6:00 a.m.\xa0 This work included splicing and aligning conveyor belts, changing defective conveyor belt rollers, moving/servicing mining equipment, and other non-production activities.\xa0A three-person crew is usually assigned to do outby conveyor belt maintenance, including conveyor belt splicing.\xa0 On the date of the accident, the crew consisted of only Grubbs and Belt because the third member of the crew was absent.Underground Conveyor BeltsAll underground outby mine conveyor belts were 48-inches wide.\xa0 At the time of the accident, there were 28,140 feet of conveyor belt and 12 conveyor belt drives.\xa0 The No. 7 conveyor belt drive, where the accident occurred, was manufactured by AMS.\xa0 The belt drive had 480-volt dual 200 horsepower motors, and a starter box manufactured by Trey K.\xa0 Investigators determined that the conveyor belt speed was 610 feet per minute.\xa0 After investigators turned a conveyor belt switch to the “off”’ position, it took about 8 seconds for the conveyor belt drive to stop rotating.\xa0 During this timeframe, the conveyor belt traveled about 42 feet.Conveyor Belt Splicing MethodConveyor belt splices were made in the following manner at this mine, after power was removed:\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0(1) conveyor belt clamps were secured, about 10 feet apart, to the conveyor belt and then were joined together with chain ratchets near each edge of the conveyor belt; (2) the ratchets were tightened to pull slack in the conveyor belt, and then the bad conveyor belt splice was cut out between the clamps; (3) on each cut end of the conveyor belt, a mechanical splice was affixed to join the conveyor belt back together; (4) the ratchets were then released at the same time, putting tension on the conveyor belt; and (5) the process is complete once the ratchets and clamps are removed.The belt splicing materials used at the accident site included conveyor belt clamps, manufactured by Flexco (60-inch belt clamp bar set), and chain ratchets, manufactured by Harrington (3-ton sets; one had a 15 foot chain and the other a 20 foot chain).Lock Out and Tag Out ProcedureThe investigators determined that, in preparation for the conveyor belt splicing work, the belt switch was turned to the “off” position to stop the conveyor belt. \xa0Grubbs and Belt did not open, lock out, and suitably tag the visual disconnect for the cable that supplied electrical power to the conveyor belt drive, which was located about 1,350 feet away – or a 10-minute ride in a personnel carrier.\xa0 Had they done so, no other miner would have been able to re-energize the conveyor belt drive while repairs were performed.In his interview, Belt stated that most of the time before starting to splice a conveyor belt, a crew member would lock and tag-out the electrical power to the conveyor belt drive.\xa0 He said that on the day of the accident, the lock out and tag out procedure was not performed because the third member of the crew was not present.\xa0 Belt remembered that Grubbs did have a padlock on his mining belt to lock out the power.\xa0Belt Switch Electrical WiringBy using on/off switches, a miner could stop and then restart the No. 7 conveyor belt, located several hundred feet from the electrical controls at the belt drive.\xa0 These on/off switches, or belt switches, installed approximately every 500 feet along the No. 7 conveyor belt, were inby the No. 7 conveyor belt drive.\xa0 The belt switches were electrically connected or spliced into a cable (No. 16 AWG, type S/O) with black, white, and green insulated wires.\xa0 This cable is called a remote cable.The belt switches were spliced into the remote cable by separating either the white or black insulated wire.\xa0 Each switch was connected so that it was between the two ends that were made when the black or white wire was separated.\xa0 See the “TYPICAL WIRING” drawing in Appendix D.\xa0 The Appendix shows that the wires of the switch, which are black and white, are not the same wires in the remote cable.\xa0 The black and white wires of the switch are spliced into the black wire of the remote cable.\xa0 The conveyor belt would run only when all belt switches were closed as shown.\xa0 A belt switch was closed when it was in the “on” position.\xa0 The electrical power to the belt drive would be deenergized when one of the belt switches was moved to the “off” position because this would open the switch.\xa0 The green wire was used for grounding purposes only.Saylor attempted to repair the damaged splice at crosscut 135 by connecting white wire to white wire and black wire to black wire.\xa0 See the “WIRING AFTER SPLICE REPAIR AT TIME OF ACCIDENT” drawing in Appendix D. \xa0This placed the belt switch in parallel with the No. 7 conveyor belt switches.\xa0 Since the switch was in the closed or “on” position, all of the inby belt switches were electrically bypassed and the No. 7 conveyor belt started.Training and ExperienceGrubbs received his latest annual refresher training on February 24, 2018.\xa0 He had a total of 8 years mining experience of which 1 year, 17 weeks, and 5 days were at this mine.\xa0 Investigators found no deficiencies in the training Grubbs received.Saylor had not been trained to perform repairs on wiring related to the damaged remote cable and belt switch wires.\xa0 \xa0\xa0The operator violated 30 CFR §§ 75.512 and 48.7 because it did not train Saylor to perform repairs on electrical circuits', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \xa0Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions which were implemented to prevent recurrence.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator performed repair and maintenance work on a conveyor belt, and did not properly lock and tag-out to ensure the electrical power was off while the work was being performed.\xa0 The operator was splicing the No. 7 conveyor belt using only the belt switch to stop the conveyor belt.\xa0 The mine operator did not have appropriate lock and tag-out policies and procedures.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator submitted a written action plan, which was reviewed and acknowledged by MSHA.\xa0 On April 4, 2018, the operator adopted the action plan as company policy and put it in the training plan.\xa0 The policy contains the following provisions:Electrical or mechanical repairs or maintenance that can result in injuries to miners due to the movement of conveyor belt shall not be performed until the following steps are taken to prevent inadvertent or unexpected motion of the conveyor belt:The person performing the work shall lock and tag the visible disconnect.\nThe tag will state the date and the name of the person performing repairs or maintenance.\nThe key to the lock shall be kept by the person performing repairs or maintenance.\nOnly the person performing the repairs or maintenance shall remove the lock after repairs or maintenance is completed.\nThe mine operator shall insure that no miner is in harm’s way before starting the conveyor belt or belts.\nThe mine operator trained all employees on the new policy and procedures.Root Cause:\xa0 The operator performed an improper repair of the remote cable and belt switch wires, which had been damaged during the on-shift examination.\xa0 The repair caused the belt to start.\xa0 The mine examiner had not been trained to repair the electrical circuit.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The electrical circuit was repaired by a miner who was qualified to perform this repair.\xa0 The mine operator retrained all miners that repairs and maintenance on any electrical circuit must be performed by a qualified electrician.', 'CONCLUSION': 'On Wednesday, March 28, 2018, at approximately 2:15 a.m., Hubert Grubbs Jr., a 29-year-old Belt Foreman with 8 years of mining experience, was fatally injured when a conveyor belt on which he was working started unexpectedly. \xa0He became entangled in the conveyor belt clamp ratchet chain and was fatally injured when the conveyor belt started.\xa0 At the time of the accident, Grubbs and a coworker were splicing a conveyor belt.The accident occurred because the operator allowed employees to engage in repair and maintenance work on a conveyor belt without implementing proper lock-out and tag-out procedures to ensure the electrical power was off.\xa0 The conveyor belt started because a mine examiner improperly repaired a remote cable and belt switch wires, which he had damaged during his examination.\xa0 The mine examiner had not been trained to repair this electrical circuit.\xa0\xa0\xa0_____________________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0

work assignments on the section 004 mmu.  the miners were working the third shift that started at 10:30 p.m.  one of grubb’s duties was to replace the bad conveyor belt splice on the no. 7 conveyor belt.at 10:00 p.m., saylor began to conduct a pre-shift examination of mine seals, located about 1,050 feet away from the main portal.  this examination is required to be completed before other third shift miners are allowed to enter the mine.  after completing this examination, saylor returned to the surface area of the main portal.at approximately 10:30 p.m., fuller and seven section maintenance crew members – keaton dillman, scoop operator; gary kirby, roof bolter; james brown, scoop operator; brent raleigh, roof bolter; donnie burton, continuous mining machine operator; and johnny ray and richard baker, electricians – traveled to the section in a personnel carrier.  they arrived at the section at about 11:45 p.m. and began their assigned tasks.  tim combs, electrician, arrived at the section at 1:00 a.m.grubbs and james belt, scoop operator/outby general laborer, who was assigned to work with grubbs to replace the bad conveyor belt splice on the no. 7 conveyor belt, waited on the mine surface for a personnel carrier to take them into the mine.  at 12:28 a.m., a carrier became available and they entered the mine.  on their way to the no. 7 conveyor belt, they stopped at the no. 1 conveyor belt to check previous splices and the no. 2 conveyor belt to gather splicing tools and materials.at 11:43 p.m., saylor reentered the mine to conduct on-shift examinations of all mine conveyor belts.  his plan was to start with the no. 1 conveyor belt and work his way to the no. 12 conveyor belt.  all conveyor belts were running at this time.  he stopped at the no. 7 conveyor belt head drive at crosscut 128 to take his lunch break.  grubbs and belt arrived while saylor was eating lunch.  while saylor and grubbs talked, belt adjusted the take-up at the no. 7 conveyor belt head drive to prepare for the conveyor belt splice.grubbs and belt then traveled inby to crosscut 142 of the no. 7 conveyor belt entry to replace the bad conveyor belt splice.  belt stopped the conveyor belt switch by using a belt switch located at crosscut 141 and positioned the splice at approximately 38 feet away from the center of crosscut 142.  grubbs and belt worked together to secure the conveyor belt clamps on both ends of the splice.  once the conveyor belt clamps were secured, grubbs and belt used two chain ratchets in conjunction with the conveyor belt clamps to pull slack in the conveyor belt.  they then removed the splice by cutting between the clamps.  belt planned to install new  splicing materials to the outby end of the conveyor belt, and grubbs would then do the same to the inby end.belt completed the outby end of the conveyor belt splice.  grubbs knelt on the bottom conveyor belt to start installing the inby side of the conveyor belt splice.  belt was handing tools and supplies to grubbs across the beltline.meanwhile, saylor finished his lunch at the no. 7 conveyor belt head drive and traveled inby along the conveyor belt entry to continue his examination.  at crosscut 135, the clearance between the conveyor belt and the rib narrowed.  saylor’s personnel carrier got stuck on the outby corner of the block of coal, causing the rear wheel to lose contact with the mine floor.  saylor placed a bottom roller hanger and rocks under the wheels to regain traction.  when he maneuvered to regain traction, the personnel carrier pulled apart the conveyor belt switch wires where a splice had been made to connect the wires to the remote cable.  saylor decided to repair the switch wires and remote cable by splicing the matching colors of the wires and remote cable together.  this inadvertently started the no. 7 conveyor belt at about 2:15 a.m.as the conveyor belt began to move, grubbs became entangled in one of the loose ends of a ratchet chain used as part of the clamping process and was dragged over the top troughing rollers.  belt saw grubbs being pulled by the belt and immediately crossed under the conveyor belt, jumped onto the personnel carrier, and headed toward the head drive to disconnect power to the no. 7 conveyor belt.still at crosscut 135, saylor heard a noise, which he surmised was from a bad conveyor belt splice.  the noise became louder and sounded more like the conveyor belt was broken and was contacting the troughing rollers.  he saw reflective material on the conveyor belt and realized that something was wrong.  he instinctively flipped the conveyor belt switch in the opposite direction, but the conveyor belt did not immediately stop.  saylor then pulled apart the conveyor belt switch wires he had just spliced.  the portion of the conveyor belt where grubbs was located coasted to a stop at crosscut 135.  the belt had traveled a total of about 585 feet (see appendix b) with grubbs on it. saylor observed that grubbs was seriously injured, but was conscious and talking.  saylor ran into the adjacent roadway and used his cap light to signal for help.  belt saw saylor in the roadway and continued to crosscut 135 where grubbs was located.  he remained with grubbs while saylor drove to the nearest mine phone located approximately 630 feet away.  at about 2:20 a.m., saylor called dallas halcomb, dispatcher, and directed him to contact emergency services and notify appropriate federal and state officials of the accident.  saylor also asked halcomb to ask all miners on the section to come to the accident scene and bring first aid supplies.  saylor traveled back to assist belt in freeing grubbs.halcomb contacted local emergency services for an ambulance, and at 2:27 a.m. called the department of labor national contact center (contact center) to report the accident.  he also called mike dempsey, mine superintendent.anthony boggs, mine foreman, entered the mine at 1:32 a.m., arriving on the section at 2:26 a.m.  soon after arriving, he learned about the accident from halcomb.  boggs then told fuller, who was also an emergency medical technician, about the accident and ordered some of the crew to gather first aid supplies and travel to the accident site.  at 2:30 a.m., boggs and fuller, as well as crew members dillman, kirby, brown, combs, and raleigh, traveled to the accident site.  three other miners, burton, ray, and baker, remained on the section.while waiting for help to arrive, saylor and belt continued their efforts to free grubbs from the conveyor belt and ratchet chains.  belt took measures to control his bleeding, while saylor traveled to the power center and disconnected the plug for the no. 7 conveyor belt drive and take-up.  he also began clearing all supplies out of his personnel carrier so grubbs could be transported out of the mine.  during this time, grubbs remained conscious and was talking.at about 2:50 a.m., boggs, fuller and the other crew members from the section arrived at the accident scene.  fuller conducted a medical assessment of grubbs, while the miners worked together to remove grubbs from the conveyor belt structure and ratchet chain.  by this time, grubbs had stopped talking but still had a pulse and was breathing.  the miners placed grubbs on a backboard and onto a personnel carrier to be transported to the surface.  kirby drove the personnel carrier, while fuller and brown continued to treat grubbs’ injuries.  belt was also with grubbs, stabilizing his spine.  boggs, saylor, dillman, combs, and raleigh followed in separate personnel carriers.at about 3:05 a.m., grubbs stopped breathing.  fuller checked for a pulse but found none and immediately began cardio pulmonary resuscitation (cpr), which he continued until they reached the surface at approximately 3:15 a.m.  grubbs was placed in the waiting ambulance by members of the transtar emergency medical service (ems).moments later, an ems crew member notified the surrounding miners that grubbs did not survive.  ems personnel contacted their dispatcher to request the coroner to travel to the mine.  philip bianchi, harlan county coroner, arrived at the mine at approximately 4:20 a.m.  bianchi recorded 3:17 a.m. as the time of death."

Burns, District Manager\n', 'OVERVIEW': 'On Friday March 16, 2018, at approximately 11:50 a.m., Jason M. Williams, a 34 year-old outby mechanic with 16 years of mining experience was fatally injured while operating a personnel carrier on a mine haulage road.\xa0 The vehicle struck the right coal rib and rolled onto its left side.\xa0 Williams was partially ejected from the personnel carrier and became trapped between the canopy of the personnel carrier and the mine floor. \xa0This accident occurred because the mine operator did not assure that equipment operators maintain full control of the personnel carrier while it was in motion.\xa0 In addition, mine management did not provide safety features to prevent persons in outby personnel carriers from being ejected.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'The Oaktown Fuels Mine No. 1 is located near Oaktown, Knox County, Indiana, and is operated by Sunrise Coal, LLC. \xa0Coal is mined from the Indiana No. 5 coal seam, which averages 7 feet in height and has a depth-of-cover of approximately 430 feet.\xa0 At the time of the accident, the mine employed 333 personnel.\xa0 The mine operates 6 days per week, with 2 production shifts and 1 idle shift each day and produces approximately 24,000 tons of raw material per day.A conveyor belt transports coal to the surface through a slope.\xa0 The slope is also used to transport supplies using tractors and trailers.\xa0 Additionally, the mine has an elevator to transport miners and materials in and out of the mine.\xa0 At the time of the accident, the mine was ventilated with an exhaust fan.\xa0 Air enters the mine via the slope, elevator shaft, and intake air shaft.\xa0 The mine has 6 active mechanized mining units (MMUs) and 2 inactive MMUs.\xa0 All mining sections utilize a split air ventilation system.The mine liberates 2,340,738 cubic feet of methane in a 24-hour period and is on a 5-day spot inspection schedule in accordance with Section 103(i) of the Mine Act.The principal officers at the time of the accident were:Rick Pigg.................................................... Operations ManagerL. Kenny Chaney............................................... SuperintendentTerry M. Dowell................................................ Safety ManagerScotty Kent.................................................. Shift Mine ManagerThe Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) began a regular (EO1) safety and health inspection on January 2, 2017.\xa0 This inspection had not been completed at the time of the accident.\xa0 The previous regular safety and health inspection was completed on December 31, 2017.\xa0 The non-fatal days lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for the Oaktown Fuels Mine No. 1 in 2017 was 2.06, compared to the National NFDL rate of 3.48 for mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On Friday, March 16, 2018, at about 6:00 a.m., Williams reported for work on the day shift at the south portal of the mine.\xa0 He attended a short meeting with Greg Hunt, Shift Maintenance Foreman, who assigned him to assist Unit No. 4 mechanics with coal hauler battery repairs. \xa0The outby mechanics normally work in pairs to conduct maintenance and repair work on the unit and outby equipment throughout the mine.\xa0 This day, however, they were split up so they could cover a larger area of the mine.\xa0 Mine tracking system records indicate that Williams entered the mine via the elevator at 6:35 a.m.\xa0 He then drove a 2-person Alpha diesel personnel carrier, company number KWT 36, along the travelway/secondary escapeway toward Unit No. 4.\xa0Williams arrived on Unit No. 4 at 7:08 a.m. and helped mechanics Joshua Roberts, Doug Lauderdale and Ryan Nickless repair damaged batteries. \xa0After completing the work on the batteries at about 11:38 a.m., Williams asked the group if they needed help with anything else.\xa0 When they replied “No,” at 11:39 a.m., Williams left Unit No. 4, and drove the diesel personnel carrier along the same travelway after leaving Unit No. 4.\xa0 He did not tell the miners where he was going.\xa0 The mine tracking system showed Williams traveled approximately 20,000 feet in the personnel carrier along the travelway, and at about 11:50 a.m. struck the right coal rib between crosscuts 135 and 136 of the M5 travelway.\xa0 The diesel personnel carrier rolled onto its left side and Williams was partially ejected.\xa0 He was trapped between the personnel carrier’s canopy and the mine floor.\xa0 There were no witnesses to the accident.A carbon monoxide (CO) sensor located between crosscuts 137 and 138 on the M5 conveyor belt measured 5 ppm of CO and went into alert status at 12:00 p.m.\xa0 Miranda Lewlyn, Mine Dispatcher, looked on the tracking system and noted that Williams was located near this sensor.\xa0 She sent him a text message asking if there was diesel equipment parked in the area to see if that was the source of the CO.\xa0 The tracking system computer showed that he did not read this message.\xa0 Investigators determined that Williams read text messages sent before the accident, indicating that the accident occurred before Lewlyn sent this message.Clayton Wise, Mine Examiner, was driving a personnel carrier while conducting a preshift examination of the travelways for the oncoming shift.\xa0 At crosscut 30 of the M6 travelway, he encountered light smoke and smelled diesel exhaust.\xa0 Wise attempted to find the source of smoke, and, as he traveled, the smoke cleared.\xa0 He could see lights in the travelway ahead of him, but could not identify them.\xa0 Wise arrived at the accident scene at 12:27 p.m. and found the personnel carrier lying on its side.\xa0 He immediately ran to the vehicle to see if someone was injured.\xa0 Wise found Williams trapped under the personnel carrier with the canopy on his chest.\xa0Wise checked for vital signs but could not find a pulse.\xa0 He then attempted to lift the personnel carrier off of Williams by hand but was unable to do so.\xa0 At about 12:29 p.m., Wise notified dispatch of the accident and requested assistance.\xa0 Lewlyn texted Scotty Kent, Shift Mine Manager, and L. Kenny Chaney, “Call Dispatch ASAP.”\xa0 They contacted Lewlyn and she provided information about the accident.\xa0 They proceeded to the accident scene in Kent’s personnel carrier.\xa0 While on their way, they encountered Hunt and asked him to go to Unit No. 1, and bring the Unit No. 1 ambulance to the accident scene.\xa0 Lewlyn contacted James Todd, Unit No. 2 Mechanic, at 12:46 p.m., to tell him to take the Unit No. 2 ambulance to the accident scene.\xa0 She also contacted Dowell and relayed information about the accident to him.\xa0 At 12:47 p.m., Dowell called 911 to request the assistance of emergency personnel.Kent and Chaney arrived at the scene at 12:51 p.m.\xa0 They determined that a forklift would be needed to lift the personnel carrier off Williams.\xa0 They traveled to crosscut 1 on the M6 travelway to get a diesel forklift.\xa0 Chaney dropped Kent off at this location and returned to the accident scene.Hunt and Todd arrived at the accident scene at approximately 12:56 p.m. with the ambulances.\xa0 Chaney and Wise gathered wood blocks to support the personnel carrier once it was lifted off Williams.\xa0 At 1:00 p.m., Kent returned to the accident scene with the forklift, which lifted the personnel carrier.\xa0 Due to the extent of Willams’ injuries, CPR was not started.\xa0 Williams was placed in a basket/backboard and then into the Unit No. 2 ambulance.\xa0 Todd and Kent transported him to the elevator. \xa0Chaney and Kent accompanied Williams to the surface, arriving at 1:23 p.m.\xa0 The Knox County EMS ambulance was waiting on the surface.\xa0 Williams was placed in the ambulance and held at the mine until Brian Hagen, Knox County Coroner, arrived, pronouncing him dead at 2:30 p.m.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'Dowell called the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center at 12:46 p.m. on March 16, 2018, to report the accident.\xa0 At 12:56 p.m., the DOL Contact Center notified Mary Jo Bishop, Assistant District Manager – Enforcement, that the accident occurred.\xa0 Bishop immediately contacted Oaktown Fuels Mine No. 1 management to inform them of their obligation to preserve any evidence pertaining to the accident.\xa0 Bishop contacted George Heacock, Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, to inform him of the accident.\xa0 Heacock assigned Keith Duncan and Bobby Smith, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspectors, to investigate the accident.\xa0 Smith arrived at the mine and issued a 103(k) order at 1:40 p.m.Duncan, Heacock, and Bishop arrived and began taking written statements and holding informal interviews.\xa0 At approximately 5:45 p.m., the MSHA investigation team, along with Indiana Bureau of Mines’ inspectors, and representatives from Sunrise Coal, traveled underground to the accident site for the initial on-scene investigation.\xa0 See Appendix A for a list of persons participating in the investigation.An autopsy was performed on March 17, 2018, at Good Samaritan Hospital.\xa0 The cause of death was attributed to closed chest and abdominal injuries, as a result of the victim being trapped under the personnel carrier.\xa0 Also, the autopsy revealed no preexisting medical conditions or substances that could have contributed to the accident or cause of death.On March 19, 2018, Denzil Hughes, MSHA Supervisory Training Specialist, reviewed training records and found that Williams’ training was up-to-date. \xa0Formal interviews were conducted on March 21, 2018, at the MSHA District 8 Office in Vincennes, Indiana.\xa0 See Appendix A for a list of persons interviewed.On March 26, 2018, Ron Medina, Mechanical Engineer, and Gary Rethage, Mechanical Engineer, both with MSHA Technical Support, collaborated with investigators to examine the personnel carrier involved in the accident.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Accident SceneThe accident occurred on the M5 travelway at crosscuts 135 and 136 in entry No. 4.\xa0 This is a main travelway and secondary escapeway for the mine.\xa0 The entry was approximately 7 feet high and 18 feet wide.\xa0 The mine floor was compacted with no abnormalities or deformities. \xa0When investigators arrived at the accident scene, they found the personnel carrier on its left side.\xa0 It had been raised above the mine floor with two sets of 6” x 6” wood crib blocks under the canopy.\xa0 Tire tracks showed the path the personnel carrier took to the point of impact.\xa0 See Appendix B for a drawing of the accident scene.Investigators observed hydraulic oil and diesel fuel on the mine floor that spilled from the tanks in the rear of the personnel carrier.\xa0 The right coal rib that the personnel carrier struck had sheets of wire mesh bolted to the coal rib and was well rock dusted, except for the point of impact twenty-one inches above the mine floor.\xa0 The impact left a hole in the wire mesh that was 2 feet wide and 1½ feet long.\xa0 The right front bumper of the personnel carrier had been pushed into the right front tire which prevented investigators from being able to move the tire.The personnel carrier’s front tire tread was compared to the tire track leading to the point of impact and found to be a match.\xa0 The steering wheel and the windshield of the personnel carrier had no visible damage.\xa0 No physical evidence found at the accident scene established why the diesel personnel carrier struck the coal rib.Company No. KWT 36 diesel-powered personnel carrierThe personnel carrier, serial number 3561, is a rear-wheel drive.\xa0 It was manufactured by Alpha Services and is an Alpha Model A3-9-63-BZ.\xa0 It is powered by a 63 horsepower (@ 2500 rpm) Mitsubishi engine.\xa0 The MSHA approval No. is 07-ENA030001.\xa0 It is equipped with a GM 350 automatic transmission and the rear axle was connected to the transmission with a drive shaft.\xa0 The personnel carrier was equipped with 215/75R15 tires on both the front and rear axles.Examination & Evaluation of the diesel-powered personnel carrierThe GM 350 transmission was manufactured by General Motors with 3-speeds and was installed in passenger vehicles.\xa0 The transmission gear ratios are 2.52:1 in first, 1.52:1 in second, and 1.00:1 in third. \xa0The company that purchased this personnel carrier from Alpha Services requested an e-clip to be installed that prevented the transmission from going into 3rd gear.\xa0 This e-clip limited the top speed of this personnel carrier to about 19.4 mph.The transmission installed on the personnel carrier was removed and examined.\xa0 Unlike the Alpha design, it did not have the e-clip to prevent shifting into third gear.\xa0 This allowed the vehicle to be shifted into third gear and travel approximately 10 mph faster (29.5 mph) than the original Alpha Services design.\xa0 Since the personnel carrier was purchased by the previous mine operator, investigators could not determine who changed the transmission.\xa0 Investigators were not able to determine the speed of the personnel carrier at the time of the accident.Although automotive-type power train components were used in the construction of this vehicle, the vehicle width is narrower than ordinarily found in passenger vehicle applications.\xa0 Also, mine-duty suspension is utilized as opposed to a passenger vehicle suspension.\xa0 The safety checklist provided by Alpha Services with each vehicle covers numerous operating and safety features including the following statement:HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS:\xa0 As with all underground equipment, this vehicle does not handle like an ordinary vehicle.\xa0 Failure to operate this vehicle correctly could cause loss of control of the vehicle, which could result in a serious accident.The mine-duty suspension and the narrower wheel track increased the potential for tilting or overturning the vehicle.\xa0 However, investigators determined that the manner in which the vehicle struck the rib was the primary factor as to why the vehicle overturned.The brake system was also inspected. \xa0The personnel carrier was equipped with a foot pedal controlled, dual circuit service brake system with disc brakes at all four wheels.\xa0 There was no power assist.The personnel carrier was also equipped with a spring-applied, hydraulic-release driveline parking brake, with release pressure provided by an engine driven hydraulic pump.\xa0 A hand-operated pump was also provided to allow release of the parking brake for towing.\xa0 After the vehicle hit the rib and came to rest on its left side, fluid leaked out from the hydraulic tank for the parking brake. To allow the service brakes to be tested, hydraulic fluid was added so the parking brake could be released.The vehicle could not be operated under its own power because the engine was damaged in the accident.\xa0 A motor mount was broken and the engine moved forward causing radiator and cooling fan damage. \xa0The front and rear axles were intact and the vehicle could be propelled with assistance.\xa0 The front right tire was freed by cutting a section of the bumper and lower fender to allow the tire to turn freely so that braking tests could be performed.The service brake system was not damaged in the accident.\xa0 Both chambers of the dual service brake master cylinder reservoir, as found, were ½ to ¾ full which was adequate to allow service brake operation.\xa0 No brake fluid was added to the master cylinder.The service brakes were tested in a surface shop area.\xa0 Dynamic stopping tests from a speed of approximately 5 mph showed that the service brakes were adequate and could achieve a 0.25 g stop as measured with a Tapley Brake Test Meter.\xa0 This is equivalent to the braking capability needed to hold the personnel carrier on a 26% grade.\xa0 The tires slid during the stopping test so the measured braking force was limited by the available coefficient of friction of the crushed limestone test surface.\xa0 The vehicle was carrying no materials at the time of the accident and was tested empty.All four tires were removed and the service brake hardware was inspected.\xa0 The brake rotors were all thicker than the minimum disc thickness of 23 mm (0.906 inches) specified by the manufacturer.\xa0 The steering axle brake linings were 0.29 inches thick on the left side and 0.31 inches thick on the right side.\xa0 The drive axle brake linings were 0.25 inches thick on the left side and 0.22 inches on the right.\xa0 These lining thicknesses were within the manufacturer’s specifications.\xa0 All the brake linings and rotors were dry and clean and not contaminated with oil or grease.In addition to the service brake testing, the parking brake, when applied, demonstrated the ability to slide the rear tires on a dry, smooth concrete shop floor.\xa0 Additionally, the throttle linkage operated freely and returned to low idle upon release.The personnel carrier was equipped with coil-spring/shock absorber suspension on both axles.\xa0 It was also equipped with an automotive-type power steering system.\xa0 All the steering linkage was intact.\xa0 The steering wheel could be turned fully in each direction when the engine was off.The vehicle had two forward facing headlights and one forward facing rib light angled to the right to illuminate the right rib.\xa0 It was also equipped with a reverse light and a tail light.\xa0 All the lighting systems functioned when tested. \xa0The inside of the operator’s cab and windshield were not damaged.The personnel carrier did not have seat belts at the time of the accident.\xa0 Alpha Services did not manufacture this personnel carrier model with seat belts.\xa0 Seat belts were provided as an option if requested by the customer.To meet the requirements of the initial purchaser, Alpha Services originally equipped the personnel carrier with clevises.\xa0 A previous operator installed a safety chain, between the clevises, across the opening of the operator’s compartment.\xa0 Investigators found that the clevises and safety chain had been removed from the personnel carrier, however, they were unable to determine who removed them.SummaryThe service brake system, the steering system, the throttle linkage, and the lights were evaluated and no defects were found.Training and ExperienceDenzil Hughes, MSHA Supervisory Training Specialist, reviewed training records.\xa0 Hughes determined that the training received by Williams, who had 16 years and 8 months total mining experience, was in compliance with 30 CFR Part 48.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the investigation and the operator’s implemented corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident:1. \xa0Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not assure that equipment operators maintain full control of the equipment while it was in motion.Corrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator retrained all miners on its existing safe operating program for diesel powered equipment.\xa0 For personnel carriers equipped with three or four gears, the mine operator removed the ability for those transmissions to shift into third or fourth gear, in order to reduce the maximum traveling speed of the carriers.\xa0 For personnel carriers equipped with only two gears, the mine operator utilized a mechanism to reduce maximum speed2.\xa0 Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not provide safety features to prevent persons in outby personnel carriers from being ejected.Corrective Actions:\xa0 The mine operator installed doors on personnel carriers.\xa0 On personnel carriers where doors were unable to be installed, the mine operator installed netting and/or seatbelts.', 'CONCLUSION': 'On Friday March 16, 2018, at approximately 11:50 a.m., Jason M. Williams, a 34 year-old outby mechanic with 16 years of mining experience was fatally injured while operating a personnel carrier on a mine haulage road.\xa0 The vehicle struck the right coal rib and rolled onto its left side.\xa0 Williams was partially ejected from the personnel carrier and became trapped between the canopy of the personnel carrier and the mine floor.\xa0This accident occurred because the mine operator did not assure that equipment operators maintain full control of the personnel carrier while it was in motion.\xa0 In addition, mine management did not provide safety features to prevent persons in outby personnel carriers from being ejected.\xa0Approved By:\xa0\xa0______________________________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ___________________Ronald W.

a.m., williams reported for work on the day shift at the south portal of the mine.  he attended a short meeting with greg hunt, shift maintenance foreman, who assigned him to assist unit no. 4 mechanics with coal hauler battery repairs.  the outby mechanics normally work in pairs to conduct maintenance and repair work on the unit and outby equipment throughout the mine.  this day, however, they were split up so they could cover a larger area of the mine.  mine tracking system records indicate that williams entered the mine via the elevator at 6:35 a.m.  he then drove a 2-person alpha diesel personnel carrier, company number kwt 36, along the travelway/secondary escapeway toward unit no. 4. williams arrived on unit no. 4 at 7:08 a.m. and helped mechanics joshua roberts, doug lauderdale and ryan nickless repair damaged batteries.  after completing the work on the batteries at about 11:38 a.m., williams asked the group if they needed help with anything else.  when they replied “no,” at 11:39 a.m., williams left unit no. 4, and drove the diesel personnel carrier along the same travelway after leaving unit no. 4.  he did not tell the miners where he was going.  the mine tracking system showed williams traveled approximately 20,000 feet in the personnel carrier along the travelway, and at about 11:50 a.m. struck the right coal rib between crosscuts 135 and 136 of the m5 travelway.  the diesel personnel carrier rolled onto its left side and williams was partially ejected.  he was trapped between the personnel carrier’s canopy and the mine floor.  there were no witnesses to the accident.a carbon monoxide (co) sensor located between crosscuts 137 and 138 on the m5 conveyor belt measured 5 ppm of co and went into alert status at 12:00 p.m.  miranda lewlyn, mine dispatcher, looked on the tracking system and noted that williams was located near this sensor.  she sent him a text message asking if there was diesel equipment parked in the area to see if that was the source of the co.  the tracking system computer showed that he did not read this message.  investigators determined that williams read text messages sent before the accident, indicating that the accident occurred before lewlyn sent this message.clayton wise, mine examiner, was driving a personnel carrier while conducting a preshift examination of the travelways for the oncoming shift.  at crosscut 30 of the m6 travelway, he encountered light smoke and smelled diesel exhaust.  wise attempted to find the source of smoke, and, as he traveled, the smoke cleared.  he could see lights in the travelway ahead of him, but could not identify them.  wise arrived at the accident scene at 12:27 p.m. and found the personnel carrier lying on its side.  he immediately ran to the vehicle to see if someone was injured.  wise found williams trapped under the personnel carrier with the canopy on his chest. wise checked for vital signs but could not find a pulse.  he then attempted to lift the personnel carrier off of williams by hand but was unable to do so.  at about 12:29 p.m., wise notified dispatch of the accident and requested assistance.  lewlyn texted scotty kent, shift mine manager, and l. kenny chaney, “call dispatch asap.”  they contacted lewlyn and she provided information about the accident.  they proceeded to the accident scene in kent’s personnel carrier.  while on their way, they encountered hunt and asked him to go to unit no. 1, and bring the unit no. 1 ambulance to the accident scene.  lewlyn contacted james todd, unit no. 2 mechanic, at 12:46 p.m., to tell him to take the unit no. 2 ambulance to the accident scene.  she also contacted dowell and relayed information about the accident to him.  at 12:47 p.m., dowell called 911 to request the assistance of emergency personnel.kent and chaney arrived at the scene at 12:51 p.m.  they determined that a forklift would be needed to lift the personnel carrier off williams.  they traveled to crosscut 1 on the m6 travelway to get a diesel forklift.  chaney dropped kent off at this location and returned to the accident scene.hunt and todd arrived at the accident scene at approximately 12:56 p.m. with the ambulances.  chaney and wise gathered wood blocks to support the personnel carrier once it was lifted off williams.  at 1:00 p.m., kent returned to the accident scene with the forklift, which lifted the personnel carrier.  due to the extent of willams’ injuries, cpr was not started.  williams was placed in a basket/backboard and then into the unit no. 2 ambulance.  todd and kent transported him to the elevator.  chaney and kent accompanied williams to the surface, arriving at 1:23 p.m.  the knox county ems ambulance was waiting on the surface.  williams was placed in the ambulance and held at the mine until brian hagen, knox county coroner, arrived, pronouncing him dead at 2:30 p.m."

Owens called him back at 5:21 p.m.\xa0 At this time, Cassell informed K. Owens of the accident.\xa0 K. Owens informed Cassell he would call Hartley.Whitlock’s personal cell phone shows he received a text message at 5:44 p.m. from Hartley stating, “Headed back.”\xa0 Investigators believe Hartley sent this message several minutes before 5:44 p.m., but it was not received by Whitlock’s cell phone when it was sent because of the loss of cell phone coverage.Terry L. Bird, Night Shift Foreman and Fork Loader Operator, stated he arrived at the mine and met Hartley at the substation.\xa0 Hartley was sitting in his truck and said the mining machine had lost power and he had lost cell phone service.\xa0 Bird allowed Hartley to use his cell phone booster.\xa0 When Hartley connected his phone to the booster he received a call from K. Owens informing him of the accident and instructing him to go to the mining machine.Hartley locked the power out at the substation and followed Bird to the mining machine.\xa0 Upon arrival, Hartley helped Cassell and Harvey with CPR. \xa0The 911 telephone recordings indicate receiving a call at 5:40 p.m. from an unidentified individual and at 5:46 p.m. from Hartley, reporting the accident.\xa0 Bird stated he spoke with K. Owens on the telephone, gave him the ambulance telephone number, and went to the entrance of the mine to escort the ambulance to the mining machine.The Jan-Care Ambulance Service reports indicate that two ambulances arrived on mine property at 7:00 p.m. Emergency medical technicians found the victim to be non-responsive.\xa0 Due to the extended time of CPR treatment (1 ½ to 2 hours) and the lack of response, CPR was discontinued per orders of Dr. Michael S. Johnson of Regional Command at Raleigh General Hospital. \xa0The time of death was recorded as 7:04 p.m.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On February 21, 2018, at 9:23 p.m., Bruce Vance, Superintendent of Pocahontas Coal Company’s Pocahontas Highwall Mine notified Jeff Branham and Aaron Cline, MSHA Coal Mine Inspectors, of the accident.\xa0 The mine operator did not notify the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center to report the accident immediately, at once, without delay, and within 15 minutes once an injury occurred to an individual at the mine which caused death.\xa0 As a result, MSHA issued a noncontributory citation for a violation of 30 CFR§ 50.10(a).\xa0 Although Hartley stated he called Federal officials when the accident occurred at 5:15 p.m.; he did not produce records of these calls and MSHA has no record of any calls being made before 9:23 p.m.At 9:33 p.m., Cline notified Nicholas Christian, MSHA Pineville Field Office Supervisor, of the accident.\xa0 Christian notified Larry E. Bailey, Assistant District Manager (Technical); Clark Blackburn, Assistant District Manager (Enforcement); and Rex A. Hampton, Electrical Specialist. \xa0Bailey notified Brian Dotson, District Manager.At midnight, Cline, Hampton, Christian, and Bailey arrived at the mine site and issued a 103(k) order to William D. Taylor, Superintendent of Operations.\xa0 This 103(k) order was issued to preserve the accident scene and to prevent the destruction of any evidence that would assist in determining the cause or causes of the accident.\xa0 Cline and Hampton conducted informal interviews with miners and obtained their written statements.\xa0 MSHA investigators reviewed examination and training records before traveling to the accident scene with Taylor and investigators from the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST).\xa0 The accident scene was secured, examined, and photographed.On February 22, 2018, at 9:00 a.m., Hampton, along with Charles E. Justice, Electrical Specialist; Jason Hess, Roof Control Supervisor; Brian Dotson, District Manager; and Tracy Calloway, Staff Assistant, arrived at the mine and met with WVOMHST investigators and company officials to continue investigating the accident.\xa0 A non-contributory citation was issued for damaged areas on the mining machine trailing cable, which needed to be repaired before electrical testing could be conducted.On February 23, 2018, Hampton, Justice, and Hess conducted tests of the mining machine and substation.\xa0 Testing of the substation included resistance measurements of the ground fields, as well as ground fault simulations to test the relay.\xa0 Additionally, the mining machine transformer compartment back-up ground fault and the emergency stop switches were tested.\xa0 All components were found to be in proper operating condition and no hazards or violations were observed that would have contributed to the accident.On February 26, 2018, MSHA and WVOMHST jointly conducted formal interviews at the National Mine Health and Safety Academy in Beaver, WV.\xa0 The persons who participated in the investigation and who were interviewed are listed in Appendix A.On February 28, 2018, Bobbie Pauley, Educational Field and Small Mine Services (EFSMS), reviewed the mine operator’s training records.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Accident Scene\nThe accident occurred in the transformer compartment located on the rear of the mining machine. \xa0The victim was found lying on the floor of the compartment with the upper portion of his body positioned behind three high voltage transformers.\xa0 An access panel adjacent to the transformer bank had been removed to gain entry into the compartment.\xa0 This provided a 12 inch wide opening between the transformer bank and the incoming 7,200 VAC cable connections/load break switch (see Appendix B).Transformer Compartment\nThe transformer compartment measures 124 inches long, 53 inches wide, and 72 inches high and contains a three phase high voltage transformer bank, which transforms the incoming 7,200 VAC to 995 VAC and 480 VAC for the motors used to operate the highwall mining machine system.\xa0 The compartment also contains another 480 VAC transformer, ventilating fans, high voltage lightning arrestors, and ground fault/ground monitor components for the 995 VAC and 480 VAC circuitry, along with a manually operated high voltage load break switch.\xa0 The load break switch is a gang-operated (one action opens or closes three connections, one for each phase, at the same time) visual disconnect switch; it was found in the open position.\xa0 When in the open position, the switch provides visual evidence that the circuitry in the transformer compartment is deenergized, except the line side of the switch, which remains energized with 7,200 VAC. \xa0The victim came in contact with one phase of the energized portion of the switch, which caused him to experience 4,160 VAC phase-to-ground. \xa0The grounding resistor, at the substation, was 261.3 ohms and the grounding circuit from the transformer compartment to the substation was 1.98 ohms. \xa0The maximum possible ground fault current was 15.8 amperes.Testing and Examination\nThe mine operator’s records indicate that a pre-shift examination and two on-shift examinations are conducted during each shift.\xa0 The pre-shift and the on-shift examination records did not show any hazards or violations for the day of the accident.The last monthly electrical examination of the mining machine, including ground faulting all breakers, was conducted by K. Owens on January 6, 2018.\xa0 The substation was last examined and tested on January 20, 2018.\xa0 No hazards or violations were reported in the examination record.Training and Experience\nWhitlock had 21 years of total mining experience, approximately eleven of which were in highwall mining.\xa0 He began working at the SHM52 Highwall Miner on June 12, 2017, as the forklift loader operator.\xa0 Additionally, he operated all equipment as needed, including the mining machine.MSHA’s EFSMS determined that Whitlock was up-to-date in his experienced miner training, which he received on June 12, 2017, as well as in his task training for the forklift loader, front-end loader, and the mining machine, which he received on June 13, 2017.\xa0Whitlock also received an electrical certification from the State of West Virginia on June 15, 2007, for a Class 26 low, medium, and high voltage classification, however, his certification expired December 31, 2016. \xa0Therefore, Whitlock was not certified by the State of West Virginia as an electrician at the time of the accident. \xa0Also, Whitlock was not qualified by MSHA to perform electrical work at the time of the accident because he had not certified to the District Manager that he had completed an electrical retraining program.\xa0 MSHA Regulations, Title 30 CFR, Part 77.103(g), states:An individual qualified in accordance with this section shall, in order to retain qualification, certify annually to the District Manager, that he has satisfactorily completed a coal mine electrical retraining program approved by the Secretary.Electrical Troubleshooting and Electrical WorkText messages on Whitlock’s personal cell phone indicate K. Owens provided advice on troubleshooting and electrical repair being done approximately 15 minutes before the accident. \xa0Cassell and Harvey assisted Whitlock in making a repair to the trailing cable prior to the accident, and Harvey also stated he had observed Whitlock working on electrical control systems on other days.Hand tools and repair materials (i.e. electrical tape, pliers, screwdrivers, plastic zip ties, and a Fluke® multimeter) were found lying on the floor and on top of the back-up ground fault system access panel inside the onboard transformer compartment (see Appendix B). \xa0The meter was turned off but had the test leads deployed. \xa0One of the back-up ground fault transformers had a broken mounting bracket and was hanging by the wiring. \xa0Investigators could not determine if this condition was present before the accident or was caused by the accident.Whitlock did not personally lock and tag out the trailing cable at the substation that supplies 7,200 VAC to the mining machine. \xa0In response to Whitlock’s request, Hartley traveled to the high voltage substation and disconnected the power to the trailing cable to allow Whitlock to perform repairs. \xa0Hartley stated that he opened the visual disconnect for the trailing cable and used a flashlight to confirm all three blades of the switch were open. \xa0He then sent a text to Whitlock’s personal cell phone confirming the power was disconnected. \xa0He waited at the substation and, when Whitlock texted him to turn the power back on, he reenergized the trailing cable. \xa0Whitlock sent a text message instructing him to remain at the substation.Title 30 CFR § 77.501 requires that electrical work only be performed by a qualified person or by a person “trained to perform electrical work and to maintain electrical work under the direct supervision of a qualified person.”\xa0 In addition, the regulation provides that disconnecting devices must be locked and tagged, and the only persons who are permitted to do this are those doing the work.\xa0 Lastly, the lock and tag can only be removed by the person who installed them. \xa0If that person is unavailable, the mine operator or his agent can authorize persons to remove them. \xa0K. Owens and Hartley were both aware that the victim was no longer certified to do electrical troubleshooting and/or electrical work, but they directed, discussed, and allowed him to do electrical troubleshooting and electrical work.\xa0 The victim had been performing electrical troubleshooting and electrical work prior to this accident when he was no longer certified to do so.\xa0 Bundy and K. Owens told investigators that Whitlock was not certified to do electrical troubleshooting and/or electrical work.\xa0 Also, Whitlock was not on the mine operator’s list of certified and qualified persons required by 30 CFR § 77.106.In addition, Hartley knew that Whitlock had not personally locked and tagged the 7,200 VAC circuit before the victim performed electrical work on that circuit.\xa0 Hartley had first-hand knowledge of this because, as indicated by his testimony and text messages, he deenergized the 7,200 VAC electrical circuit for Whitlock. \xa0Hartley also knew that Whitlock had not personally removed his lock and tag prior to the 7,200 VAC circuit being reenergized, because Hartley removed the lock and tag and reenergized the circuit for him.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 A root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the investigation and the operator’s implemented corrective actions to prevent a reoccurrence of this type of accident.Root Cause: \xa0The mine operator did not perform test and repair work on electrical equipment and circuitry in a safe manner.\xa0 The mine operator did not use proper lock out/tag out procedures.Corrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator developed and implemented an action plan to prevent similar occurrences. \xa0This plan includes controls to ensure:Only qualified personnel perform electrical work;\nMiners receive additional training on electrical testing and repair;\nThe installation of safety features on electrical equipment. \xa0The safety features include lid switches wired into the ground monitor circuit, a grounding bar on the load break switch for the three phases of the high voltage transformers, and an additional external visible vacuum disconnect, which will also interrupt the ground monitor circuit causing the substation to remove power on the trailing cable; and\nProper lock /tag out procedures.\nThe mine operator incorporated the provisions of the action plan into the training and ground control plans for this mine. \xa0All miners were trained in these new company policies.', 'CONCLUSION': 'On Wednesday, February 21, 2018, at approximately 5:15 p.m., James A. Whitlock, a 38-year old Highwall Mining Machine Operator with approximately 21 years of total mining experience, was electrocuted when he came into contact with an energized connection of a 7,200 VAC electrical circuit.\xa0 He was found inside the onboard high voltage transformer compartment that supplies power to the mining machine.\xa0 He had entered the compartment to troubleshoot and/or perform electrical work on the circuit.The accident occurred because the operator did not ensure the safe operation, testing, and repair of electrical equipment and circuitry, including use of proper lock out/tag out procedures.\xa0 Mine management was aware that Whitlock’s electrician certification had expired, and therefore, he was precluded from performing electrical work by State and Federal regulations.\xa0 However, mine management advised, directed, and assisted him in performing electrical work at the mine.Approved By:\xa0\xa0__________________________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ________________Brian M.

february 21, 2018, whitlock arrived at the mine at approximately 6:00 a.m.  he met day shift foreman and fork loader operator, jeffrey r. hartley; front end loader operator larry cassell; and pad man, jeffrey a. harvey, at the mining machine to begin the shift.  the miners on the previous shift had completed mining in one pit and had started moving the mining machine to the next pit but were impeded by excessive mud and debris.  to continue the moving operation, cassell began removing mud and debris from the pit, while hartley, harvey, and whitlock performed routine maintenance on the mining machine.  superintendent/electrician kevin s. owens arrived at approximately 8:00 a.m. and performed mechanical and electrical maintenance on the machine.the miners continued maintenance and pit preparation throughout the shift.  sometime between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m., k. owens left the mine to obtain supplies in beckley, wv. k. owens informed investigators that he received a text message on his personal cell phone from the company’s cell phone.  the text message informed k. owens that electrical power had been lost.  k. owens then began sending texts to whitlock’s personal cell phone regarding electrical work.hartley informed msha investigators that whitlock instructed him to drive to the substation, approximately 8,000 feet from the mining machine, to lock out the power source.  hartley stated he locked out the power and verified the load break switch was open by using a flashlight to look through the sight glass.  hartley informed whitlock by text message that the power was locked out and waited for whitlock’s instructions.  whitlock’s cell phone records indicate at 4:51 p.m. a text message was received from hartley stating “it is locked out.”harvey stated he and cassell assisted whitlock in making the mining machine trailing cable repair on the ground near the mining machine.  whitlock then returned to the mining machine as harvey and cassell began fueling the welder, air compressor, and pump.whitlock’s cell phone records indicate k. owens sent a text message to whitlock at 5:04 p.m. describing a loose ground lug (which can cause electrical power to be lost) he had previously encountered.  this ground lug was inside the high voltage transformer compartment.at 5:04 p.m., whitlock instructed hartley, who had remained at the substation, to re-energize the electrical power.  hartley re-energized the electrical power and asked whitlock what to do next.  whitlock said he could sit there or go home since it was close to the end of the shift.  hartley remained at the substation in his vehicle.  whitlock’s cell phone records indicate at 5:05 p.m., a message from hartley stated “turning on light switch” and at 5:10 p.m., stating “sit here a min?.”k. owens sent another text message at 5:10 p.m. stating “if you don’t see anything pretty obvious let’s set it back up and try to have nightshift running bud.”at 5:13 p.m., whitlock responded to hartley stating “yeah, just chill a few more mins then go home.” after fueling the equipment, harvey and cassell walked toward the mining machine and heard whitlock yell.  cassell went to the electronic control module (ecm) room and harvey went to the transformer compartment where he found whitlock laying inside.harvey and cassell pulled whitlock out of the transformer compartment and checked his vital signs.  cassell and harvey stated they could not find a pulse and began cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr).cassell tried to call k. owens and hartley with his cell phone to inform them of the accident, however, k. owens and hartley did not answer their phones.  cassell informed investigators that he sent text messages to k. owens and hartley at approximately 5:20 p.m.  cassell’s text to k. owens stated “call me now.”  the text sent to hartley stated “do not set power up and come to miner.”  cassell stated his phone history indicated k. owens called him back at 5:21 p.m.  at this time, cassell informed k. owens of the accident.  k. owens informed cassell he would call hartley.whitlock’s personal cell phone shows he received a text message at 5:44 p.m. from hartley stating, “headed back.”  investigators believe hartley sent this message several minutes before 5:44 p.m., but it was not received by whitlock’s cell phone when it was sent because of the loss of cell phone coverage.terry l. bird, night shift foreman and fork loader operator, stated he arrived at the mine and met hartley at the substation.  hartley was sitting in his truck and said the mining machine had lost power and he had lost cell phone service.  bird allowed hartley to use his cell phone booster.  when hartley connected his phone to the booster he received a call from k. owens informing him of the accident and instructing him to go to the mining machine.hartley locked the power out at the substation and followed bird to the mining machine.  upon arrival, hartley helped cassell and harvey with cpr.  the 911 telephone recordings indicate receiving a call at 5:40 p.m. from an unidentified individual and at 5:46 p.m. from hartley, reporting the accident.  bird stated he spoke with k. owens on the telephone, gave him the ambulance telephone number, and went to the entrance of the mine to escort the ambulance to the mining machine.the jan-care ambulance service reports indicate that two ambulances arrived on mine property at 7:00 p.m. emergency medical technicians found the victim to be non-responsive.  due to the extended time of cpr treatment (1 ½ to 2 hours) and the lack of response, cpr was discontinued per orders of dr. michael s. johnson of regional command at raleigh general hospital.  the time of death was recorded as 7:04 p.m."

2017.\xa0 The nonfatal days lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for the Sentinel Mine for 2017 was 1.16 compared to the national NFDL rate of 3.48 for mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On Monday, February 5, 2018, Leonard Griffith started his shift at 11:00 p.m.\xa0 He \xa0was assigned to perform routine maintenance on the continuous mining machine on the left side of the section.\xa0 Griffith performed this task before and regularly worked in 3-Section.\xa0 He rode with other miners in a diesel-powered personnel carrier to 3-Section, arriving at 11:56 p.m.\xa0 Griffith walked to the tool car and then to the continuous mining machine located in the No. 1 entry. \xa0Earl Moats, Section Foreman, was conducting his initial examination of the section and briefly spoke to Griffith as he passed by the continuous mining machine at approximately 12:10 a.m.Jason Harris, Dale Tenney, and Richard Chambers, Electricians, also regularly worked on 3-Section. \xa0Harris and Tenney were also assigned to repair a broken conveyor chain on the continuous mining machine on the right side of the section.\xa0 Chambers initially helped Harris and Tenney \xa0find crib blocks to support the cutting head, before he went to help Griffith.Chambers walked toward the left side of the section to help Griffith but was redirected by John Payne, Contractor Crew Leader, to repair a scoop.\xa0 Chambers contacted Frank Mullenax, Outby Electrician, to assist him in troubleshooting the scoop. \xa0At approximately 1:30 a.m., Mullenax arrived at the scoop.The mine-wide tracking system shows that between 12:00 a.m. and 1:15 a.m., Griffith made several trips to the tool car and back to the continuous mining machine. \xa0\xa0Harris briefly spoke to Griffith at approximately 1:10 a.m.\xa0 After that, no one had contact with Griffith.\xa0 At approximately 3:45 a.m., Ben Poling, Maintenance Foreman/Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), and Harvey Glotfelty, Assistant Maintenance Superintendent, were walking across the section and discovered Griffith under the rib.Poling and Glotfelty initially tried to move the large piece of rib on top of Griffith, without success.\xa0 Poling then went to find help, and Glotfelty stayed with Griffith, removing smaller pieces of the rib that had fallen on him. \xa0Poling found \xa0Mullenax and Chambers and directed them to go to the accident scene.\xa0 Poling continued across the section and contacted Moats who notified Anthony Moran, Dispatcher.\xa0 Moran called 911 at 3:53 a.m.Mullenax and Chambers arrived at the scene and helped Glotfelty remove the large piece of rib from Griffith (see Appendix A).\xa0 They moved him away from the unstable rib to the rear of the continuous mining machine, a safe location.\xa0 Poling and Glotfelty checked Griffith’s vital signs; no pulse was detected. \xa0They placed him on a backboard and carried him to a 4-person diesel personnel carrier.\xa0 He was driven across the section and transferred to a larger 14-person diesel personnel carrier. \xa0Poling, Everette Kalbaugh, Shift Foreman/Paramedic, Tim Tenney, Electrician/EMT, and Shane Wilfong, Utility Man, boarded the personnel carrier.\xa0 Poling drove the carrier and Kalbaugh, Tenney, and Wilfong administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on the way to the elevator.\xa0 Griffith was transported by elevator to the surface.Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT’s) from Barbour County Emergency Medical Services were waiting on the surface and took control of Griffith at 4:40 a.m.\xa0 They continued CPR, as Griffith was transported to Broaddus Hospital in Philippi, West Virginia.\xa0 Dr. Patrick O’Donnell examined Griffith and pronounced him dead at 5:35 a.m.', 'INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT': 'The Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center was notified of the accident on February 6, 2018, at 4:02 a.m.The DOL Contact Center notified Steve Stankus, Bridgeport Field Office Supervisor, who contacted mine officials and notified them of their responsibility to preserve the accident scene.\xa0 Mike Stark, Staff Assistant, assigned Michael Fasouletos, Coal Mine Safety and Health Specialist, Roof Control, and Ronald Postalwait, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, to investigate the accident.\xa0 Postalwait arrived at the mine at approximately 6:45 a.m.\xa0 He issued a \xa0103(k) order to prevent the destruction of any evidence which would assist in investigating the cause or causes of the accident and to assure the safety of all persons at this operation.\xa0The accident investigation was conducted in conjunction with the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST) and Wolf Run Mining LLC. \xa0The team conducted preliminary interviews with persons having knowledge of the facts and circumstances concerning the accident before going underground.The investigation team traveled to 3-Section, took photographs and measurements at the accident site (see Appendix B), and developed a sketch of the area where Griffith was found (see Appendix C).On February 8, 2018, Fasouletos travelled to the location of the accident with Mike Gauna, Mining Engineer, and Ryan Stephan, Mechanical Engineer, both from MSHA Technical Support.\xa0 They evaluated the accident site and rib conditions.On February 13, 2018, the investigation team conducted formal interviews at the WVOMHST Westover Office.\xa0 A list of persons who were interviewed and who participated in the accident investigation is in Appendix D.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Accident Site\nThe accident took place in the No. 1 entry just outby the No. 16 crosscut on 3-Section. \xa0The entry was mined uphill at a 15 percent grade from the No. 15 crosscut to follow a change in the orientation of the coal seam.\xa0 The original mine entry at the accident site was approximately 7 feet high by 18 feet wide. \xa0The average width at the accident site after the rib roll occurred was 18.9 feet.\xa0 The depth of cover was approximately 700 feet with no overmining or undermining in the vicinity.The fallen rib measured approximately 18 feet long by 7 feet high and up to 14 inches thick.\xa0 The fallen rib material had a fragmented texture with slabs and blocks of varying sizes.\xa0 The large portion of the rib removed from on top of Griffith was 36 to 42 inches long by 28 inches high and up to 14 inches thick.The rib roll occurred because of geologic features that were difficult to see.\xa0 These features became apparent during the investigation.\xa0 The rib was weakened by the interaction of coal cleats, inconsistent rock partings scattered within the seam, and barely perceptible small discontinuous slickenside structures, along with the normal pillar surface yielding after an area has been mined.Roof Control Plan\nThe operator’s approved roof control plan required rib bolt installation in the conveyor belt entry where heights are greater than 72 inches.\xa0 This fatality occurred in the No. 1 entry, not the conveyor belt entry.\xa0 Additionally, all pillar corners are required to be rib bolted with ¾-inch-diameter, 4-foot-long fully- grouted fixtures with suitable bearing plates.\xa0 There were three to four rib bolts installed within five feet of each pillar corner on 3-Section and the conveyor belt entry was rib bolted.\xa0 Investigators found that the mine operator had complied with the approved roof control plan at the scene of the accident.Examinations\nA review of the pre-shift and on-shift records for examinations made prior to the accident indicate mine examiners did not report any adverse rib conditions.\xa0 Moats also stated he did not observe adverse rib conditions when he traveled between the left side of the continuous mining machine and the solid coal rib during his initial examination.\xa0 Interviews with miners and mine management revealed it was common practice for persons to identify hazardous rib conditions and scale ribs throughout the active mining sections.\xa0Training Records\nWilliam Roberts, MSHA Training Specialist, reviewed the training records for Griffith.\xa0 Griffith had been employed at this mine since January 5, 2015, and his last annual refresher training was conducted on January 6, 2018. \xa0Griffith had received his required task training; however, the documentation was incomplete.\xa0 MSHA issued eight non-contributory citations for inadequate documentation of task training.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 A root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the investigation and the operator’s implemented corrective action to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident.Root Cause: \xa0The rib support system used at the mine was not adequate for the geologic conditions at the location of the accident.Corrective Action: The mine operator revised the roof control plan to require the installation of rib bolts in all entries on

The mine operates two 10-hour production shifts per day, six days per week. The coal is mined from two pits, identified as the Winifrede Ryder, and the Chilton Coal Seams, with front end loaders, haul trucks, and bulldozers. The bulldozers assist with both the production process and reclamation process. \xa0At the time of the accident, this mine was in the process of being reopened by a new operator and had not resumed coal production.The principal officers for Black Jewell, LLC were:Jeffrey Hoops...............................................................

Metin Savasman, Deputy Chief Medical Examiner.', 'INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT': 'The Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center was notified by Tyrone Watts, Mine Superintendent, of the accident on December 29, 2017, at 1:41 a.m.\xa0 The Contact Center notified Kelly Acord, District 4 Special Investigations Supervisor, at 1:54 a.m.\xa0 Acord contacted Franklin Stover, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector (CMI)/Accident Investigator, and dispatched him to the accident site. \xa0Stover traveled to the mine site and issued a 103(k) order at 4:45 a.m. to ensure the safety of the miners and to preserve the accident scene.The accident investigation was conducted jointly with West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST), and Black Jewell, LLC.While at the accident scene, Stover, along with Andrew Sedlock, CMI/Accident Investigator, gathered preliminary information from mine personnel and examined the site of the accident.\xa0 They found that the bulldozer, which had not been moved, was on a steep slope and was unstable. \xa0Since it was not safe to investigate the bulldozer in that position, it was removed to a safe location.\xa0 On March 13, 2018, the investigation team conducted an examination of the inside of the cab.Interviews were conducted with mine personnel who were determined to have potential information related to the accident and the mechanical condition of the D-9T bulldozer (see Appendix A).\xa0 On January 4, 2018, MSHA and WVOMHST conducted formal interviews at WVOMHST’s office in Oak Hill, West Virginia.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Location of AccidentThe Caterpillar D-9T bulldozer operated by Thurman Watts was working in the Winifrede Ryder Pit, pushing shot material over a crest of the highwall.\xa0 After traveling over the highwall, the bulldozer dropped approximately 100 feet and continued down the spoil bank, coming to rest approximately 400 feet from the top of the highwall (see Appendix B).General Machine InformationThe bulldozer was built by Caterpillar and was a model D-9T.\xa0 It was equipped with a rollover protective structure (ROPS).\xa0 It also had an enclosed cab with a falling object protective structure (FOPS).\xa0 The bulldozer had a power shift transmission with three forward gears and three reverse gears, with a maximum speed of 7.3 mph going forward and 8.9 mph in reverse.\xa0 When investigators conducted an examination of the bulldozer, they found the transmission gear selector in reverse and the park brake was released.The bulldozer has an approximate operating weight of 106,836 lbs including blade and counterweight. \xa0The bulldozer had an overall length of approximately 22 feet; height of 12.5 feet; the track width is 9.4 feet from outside to outside of track with 24 inch shoes.Adrian Owsley, Day-shift D-9T Bulldozer Operator, reported that he had not experienced any mechanical issues with the brakes or steering.\xa0The bulldozer lights were destroyed during the accident. \xa0A review of the operators’ pre-operational examination records did not list any defective lighting on the day of the accident.ROPS and Seat BeltThe rollover protective structure (ROPS) was not altered or damaged and the confines of the cab interior maintained its integrity. \xa0The outer plastic of the seat belt buckle or latch had broken off, exposing the seat belt inner mechanism (see Appendix B). \xa0The seat belt was tested and found to be functioning properly.\xa0 Investigators found the seat belt unbuckled, however, they were not able to determine if the victim was wearing the seat belt at the time of the accident.Braking SystemThe service and parking brake systems consisted of spring-applied, hydraulic-released enclosed wet disc brakes on both the right and left side track drives. \xa0The service and parking brake systems are housed in the same unit as the track drives but are actuated by separate controls. \xa0The service brake is activated by a foot pedal and modulates the brake release pressure to both brakes according to the foot pedal position. \xa0The parking brake is actuated by a hand control lever, fully applying and releasing both brakes. When either of these two controls is used, both the left and right side brakes apply and release together.\xa0 Due to the extensive damage the bulldozer received during the accident, investigators were unable to conduct a brake function test.Maintenance RecordsThe Caterpillar D-9T was inspected by WVOMHST on December 18, 2017, and it issued five violations for the following conditions: 1) portable fire extinguisher was discharged; 2) lower windshield wiper on left side was bent; 3) four lights were not working; 4) the left boarding step was missing; and 5) the left handrail was bent.Investigators discovered that the D-9T bulldozer was out of service during the day-shift of December 28, 2017, because of a ruptured hydraulic hose. \xa0The hydraulic hoses were replaced and the machine was put back in service on the evening shift.\xa0 All of the defects where repaired, and the state inspector noted on December 28, 2017, that the conditions giving rise to the violations had been abated.Push PracticesDotson stated in his formal interview that before the accident, Thurman Watts was establishing a roadway into the previously blasted material to allow the loader and rock trucks access into the pit. \xa0He was pushing material into the push path of the D-11 bulldozer, and then Dotson would push the material over the highwall. \xa0Evidence gathered at the accident site and interviews reveal that at the time of the accident, both bulldozers were operating perpendicular to the highwall, pushing the material out and over the highwall.Statements gathered during interviews revealed that bulldozer operators were instructed by the company foreman to leave one blade of material on top of the highwall and push that material over with the next blade of material.\xa0 This was called the two blade technique but this technique was not included in the ground control plan or any other written company policy or procedure.\xa0 The equipment operators interviewed stated this was discussed regularly in safety meetings.\xa0 Investigators could not determine if the victim was using the two blade technique at the time of the accident.When ground conditions are irregular, pushed material can be continuously deposited in the push path of the bulldozer and/or at the edge of the highwall.\xa0 The bulldozer can then travel on top of this material or spoil where this unconsolidated spoil can create unstable conditions near the highwall.Investigators determined that the ground conditions where the victim was working were irregular.\xa0 The bulldozer operated by Thurman Watts traveled onto an area of unstable spoil that had deposited on the top of the highwall.\xa0 Because of this, the bulldozer was not being operated a safe distance from the edge.\xa0 The spoil slipped down the highwall face under the bulldozer, causing it to go over the highwall.\xa0Ground Control PlanThe ground control plan was acknowledged on August 14, 2008; a revision to the ground control plan was received on December 14, 2017, and acknowledged on January 4, 2018. \xa0This update added a highwall mining machine to the ground control plan. There were no safety precautions in the updated ground control plan that addressed bulldozers pushing material over highwalls.\xa0 The mine operator was in compliance with the ground control plan at the time of the accident.\xa0 Since the “two blade” technique was discussed with miners, a noncontributory citation was issued for a violation of § 77.1000 because the technique was not listed in the ground control plan.Weather ConditionsWeather was not a factor in the accident.\xa0 It was clear, with cold temperature, no fog or precipitation at time of accident.\xa0 The snow shown in the accident photos fell after the accident had occurred.ExaminationsThe pre-shift and on-shift examinations conducted on December 28, 2017, by Tyrone Watts indicated there were no hazards observed for the highwalls or working pits.The pre-shift examination conducted by Calhoun indicated there were no hazards observed for the highwalls or working pits.\xa0 Calhoun had not yet completed his on-shift examination at the time the accident.The pre-operational examination conducted on the Caterpillar D-9T bulldozer on December 28, 2017, revealed no safety defects.\xa0 The examinations conducted on December 26, 2017, indicated a manifold leak found on the evening shift, and the day shift exam indicated a right jack light out.\xa0 Those defects were corrected prior to the accident.Training and ExperienceThurman Watts received his miner certification on July 11, 2007, and his surface mine foreman card on May 26, 2010. \xa0He received experienced miner training on December 6, 2017, and Calhoun conducted this training. \xa0According to Calhoun, Thurman Watts was current with his annual refresher training.\xa0 Calhoun also informed investigators that his experienced miner training consisted of discussions of health and safety aspects of the job, hazards that may be encountered on the job, tasks he would be assigned to perform, a tour of the mine property, communications, and first aid kit locations.Task training was conducted by Calhoun on December 6, 2017, on both the Caterpillar D-9T and the Caterpillar D-11. At the training, Calhoun asked Thurman Watts about his past experience, and was told he had been operating bulldozers for several years at other surface mines. \xa0Calhoun observed Thurman Watts conducting a pre-operational check and operating the machines.\xa0 Calhoun also observed Thurman Watts using the two blade technique in the Winifrede Ryder pit.\xa0 Additionally, Calhoun discussed the two blade technique with Watts and Dotson during prior shifts at this mine.\xa0 Investigators found that the training was completed in accordance with the requirements of 30 CFR Part 48.As previously stated, the mine operator regularly discussed the two-blade technique in safety meetings.\xa0 The victim would have attended these safety meetings.\xa0 Also, Dotson stated that the victim worked in this area of the mine along with him for several shifts.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \xa0A root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the investigation and the operator’s implemented corrective action to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident:Root Cause:\xa0 The policies and procedures used by the mine operator did not ensure that safe working conditions were provided for the employees at all times. \xa0The ground conditions were irregular and caused the bulldozer to travel onto an area of unstable spoil that had deposited on the top of the highwall.\xa0 Because of this, the bulldozer was not being operated a safe distance from the edge.\xa0 The spoil slipped down the highwall face under the bulldozer, causing it to go over the highwall.\xa0Corrective Action: \xa0The mine operator developed a procedure and added it as a revision to its ground control plan to prevent a similar occurrence of this accident. \xa0The ground control plan was revised to require that equipment used to push material over elevated highwalls employ the “two blade” method of pushing (one blade of material will be left at the edge and pushed over with the following blade of material).Additionally, the company added a procedure to address irregular ground conditions and/or highwalls.\xa0 The mine operator will conduct a pre-shift examination and an on-shift examination every four hours.\xa0 The examination will include observations and evaluations of the ground conditions and highwall edge. \xa0Any hazardous condition, such as a highwall overhang, broken highwall edge, or unconsolidated material, that could fail and cause equipment to travel over the highwall, will be reported. \xa0All hazardous areas found will be dangered off to prevent exposure to the hazard.\xa0 No bulldozers will be allowed to push material in those areas until the hazards are eliminated.All bulldozer operators were trained in the revised ground control plan.\xa0 The plan also requires training to be provided to new employees concerning the revised ground control plan and hazards associated with operating equipment while pushing materials over the edge of highwalls.', 'CONCLUSION': 'On Friday, December 29, 2017, at approximately 12:57 a.m., Thurman Watts, a 34-year-old bulldozer operator with 10 years of mining experience, was fatally injured when the Caterpillar D-9T bulldozer he was operating traveled over a highwall.\xa0 The bulldozer dropped approximately 100 feet and continued down the spoil bank, coming to rest approximately 400 feet from the top of the highwall.

Mandeville, District Manager', 'OVERVIEW': 'On Monday, October 23, 2017, at approximately 4:29 a.m., James R. Adkins, a 48-year-old mine examiner with 18 years of mining experience, fell onto a moving conveyor belt and received fatal injuries.\xa0 Adkins was attempting to cross the conveyor belt at the tailpiece in order to complete his examination of the No. 1 conveyor belt when he fell.\xa0 He had been assigned to conduct a pre-shift examination of the No. 1, 2, and 3 conveyor belts, electrical boxes and track entry of the Horse Creek Eagle mine for the day shift. \xa0The accident occurred because the operator did not follow proper safety procedures.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'The Horse Creek Eagle Mine is an underground coal mine operated by Marfork Coal Co., LLC in the Eagle coal seam and is located near Naoma in Raleigh County, West Virginia. \xa0The mine operates two production shifts and one maintenance shift, five to six days per week, and employs 125 people. \xa0The mine is accessed and ventilated by eight drift portals.\xa0 Bituminous coal is produced from two mining sections using the room and pillar method of mining.\xa0 Each mining section utilizes two continuous mining machines and shuttle cars to extract and haul the coal from the face areas.\xa0 The mine produces an average of 3,561 raw tons of coal per day. \xa0The coal is transported to the surface via a conveyor belt system that travels the surface and underground areas of a series of mines before arriving at the Marfork Coal preparation plant (see Appendix A).\xa0 The principal officers for the mine at the time of the accident were:Charles Bearse.................................................... PresidentDelbert Harper.............................. Mine SuperintendentThomas Hess.............................. General Mine ForemanMichael Vaught....................................... Safety ManagerAt the time of the accident, a regular (E01) safety and health inspection that was started on October 3, 2017 was in progress.\xa0 The previous regular inspection was completed on September 21, 2017. \xa0The non-fatal days lost (NFDL) injury incident rate for the Horse Creek Eagle Mine for 2016 was 4.58 compared to the national NFDL rate of 3.37 for mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On October 23, 2017, James Adkins started his shift at 3:50 a.m. by checking in with Randy Stover, Mine Dispatcher. \xa0Adkins had a short conversation with Stover before collecting his multi-gas detector and radio and going to work.\xa0 As a mine examiner/belt man, he performed maintenance and cleaning on his assigned conveyor belts and addressed any hazardous conditions recorded in the mine examination books.\xa0 Between 4:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m., he would have conducted examinations to determine airflow direction, methane and oxygen quantities, and the presence of any hazardous conditions, as well as any violations of mandatory standards. \xa0He then would have recorded the results in the examination book located in the mine office.The mine tracking system shows that at 4:10 a.m., Adkins recorded the date, time, and his initials (DTIs) at the date board located at the No. 1 belt drive outside the mine belt portal.\xa0 He then entered the mine and traveled along the conveyor belt, recording his DTIs at successive date boards. \xa0At 4:26 a.m., his final DTIs were recorded at the off-side of the No. 1 belt across from the No. 2 belt junction point. \xa0His DTIs were not recorded on the next date board, which was directly across the belt on the walkway side (see Appendix B).At about the same time, Gary Hastings and Joseph Varette, Owl Shift Examiners and Belt Men, were checking for bad belt splices at the No. 5A belt drive. \xa0They called to ask Stover, the dispatcher, to turn on the No. 1 to No. 5A belts and run them from outside. \xa0Stover warned miners by radio, calling “belts coming on” four times before starting the belts. \xa0The computer system shows that the No. 1 beltline started at 4:28:23 a.m., about two minutes after Adkins left his final DTIs.At 6:03 a.m., the overland belt transfer system was started up and coal was loaded onto the belt system from the belt stacker tube stock pile by a bulldozer.\xa0 After 6:30 a.m., Jesse Smith, Owl Shift Mine Examiner, noticed that the personnel carrier driven by Adkins was parked outby the No. 2 belt head along the No. 1 beltline.\xa0 Smith walked over to the beltline and called for Adkins.\xa0 When he received no answer, he called Stout to ask where Adkins was located.\xa0 Stout stated that the tracking system showed Adkins was on the surface.\xa0When Smith recorded the results of his examination in the record book, he noticed that Adkins had not filled out his examination record.\xa0 Shortly before 7:00 a.m., Smith asked at the examiner’s office if anyone had seen Adkins.\xa0 No one had, so Smith informed Thomas Hess, General Mine Forman, and together they started to look outside and then underground for Adkins.\xa0 Smith found the hard hat belonging to Adkins on the mine floor at the belt airlock at No. 3 break. \xa0He ran outside and called on the radio to shut all the mine belts off. \xa0At 7:04:27 a.m., David Stout, Mine Dispatcher for the day shift, shut down the beltlines.Smith proceeded to check the feeder area at the belt stacker tube, where the No. 1 conveyor belt ended. \xa0He found the cap light worn by Adkins on the ground beside the transfer belt. \xa0Smith then traveled along the transfer conveyor belt to the Horse Creek No. 12 transfer point located across from the Allen Powellton Mine, looking for signs of Adkins.At about 7:09 a.m., Stout notified the Marfork Preparation Plant, Brushy Eagle Mine, Coon Cedar Grove Mine, Slip Ridge Cedar Grove Mine, and the Allen Powellton Mine to shut down their belts and to start looking for a missing miner.\xa0 He also called the Whitesville Ambulance service at 7:22 a.m., and an ambulance arrived at the mine at 8:15 a.m.Miners from the underground Horse Creek Eagle Mine, Slip Ridge Cedar Grove Mine, Coon Cedar Grove Mine and the Marfork Preparation Plant traveled all of the conveyor belts and associated belt transfers looking for signs of the missing mine examiner.\xa0 Adkins was found at 10:44 a.m. as excavators dug coal out from around the No. 3 raw coal stacker tube at the Marfork Preparation Plant.\xa0 His location indicated that he had been transported 7.2 miles from the No. 1 conveyor belt to the plant.\xa0Adkins was recovered by company Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), Rob Asbury, Dave Green, Adam Sipes, Kelton Cozart, Brian Jarrell, and Shannon Dickens, and taken to a Whitesville Fire and Emergency Medical Services ambulance. \xa0At 11:00 a.m., the ambulance left the property and transported Adkins to the fire department, where he was pronounced dead by State of West Virginia Medical Examiner, Teddy Yeager.', 'INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT': 'On October 23, 2017, at 7:12 a.m., Stout, Mine Dispatcher, called the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center to report the accident. \xa0At 7:32 a.m., the DOL Contact Center notified Donald Phillips, Conference and Litigation Representative, who informed Lincoln Selfe, Assistant District Manager.\xa0 Selfe contacted Delbert Harper, Mine Superintendent, to inform him of the operator’s obligation to preserve the accident scene.\xa0 Selfe assigned Larry Hedrick and John Stone, Jr., Coal Mine Safety & Health Inspectors (Electrical)/Accident Investigators, to investigate the accident.\xa0 Hedrick and Stone traveled to the mine and Hedrick issued a 103(k) order to protect miners and to prevent the destruction of any evidence.The accident investigation was conducted in conjunction with the West Virginia Office of Miner’s Health, Safety, and Training (WVOMHST), mine management, and employees at the mine.\xa0 Investigators obtained statements from persons having knowledge of the facts and circumstances concerning the accident, retrieved information from the mine’s tracking and communications system, and photographed, sketched, and surveyed the accident scene.On October 27, 2017, MSHA and WVOMHST jointly conducted formal interviews at the office of the WVOMHST office in Oak Hill, WV. \xa0Persons who participated in the investigation are listed in Appendix C.\xa0', 'DISCUSSION': 'Adkins Work ScheduleEleven weeks prior to the accident, Adkins assisted the midnight shift with pre-shift examinations.\xa0 He started his shift about 4:00 a.m. and conducted examinations of the belts, track, and electrical installations along the No. 1, 2, and 3 belt conveyors for the on-coming day shift. \xa0This was in addition to his normal mine examiner duties on the day shift.Accident SiteThere were no witnesses to the accident.\xa0 However, the mine tracking system, the sequence of date board signatures, and other physical evidence indicated to the investigators that the following happened:Adkins parked his personnel carrier at the No. 9 crosscut on the No. 1 conveyor belt and traveled on foot to conduct the rest of his examinations. \xa0He traveled along the No. 1 conveyor belt from the No. 9 crosscut to the No. 11 crosscut, where he placed his DTI on the date board and checked the two power centers.\xa0 He then used the crossunder at surveyor spad 6658 and walked behind the guard at the No. 2 belt drive and take-up unit, where he examined the offside of the No. 2 belt drive (see Appendix B).After Adkins placed his DTI on the offside date board, he attempted to cross the No. 1 conveyor belt at the No. 1 conveyor belt tailpiece rather than returning to the crossunder, which was 95 feet away. As he attempted to cross, he fell onto the No. 1 belt at approximately the same time that the conveyor belt was started up. Adkins was then transported on the No. 1 conveyor belt out of the mine.Investigators examined the accident area and tested the No. 1 belt drive and belts, as well as the belt start and stop switches and belt drive at the No. 2 belt transfer. \xa0The investigators determined that the belt controls were working properly.Remote Belt Start ProcedureWhen the accident occurred, all miners located near the outby belts, including Adkins, had two-way radios.\xa0 Before starting the No. 1 through No. 5A belts at about 4:30 a.m., Stover, the dispatcher, used the outby radio channel to inform miners that the belts were getting ready to start.\xa0 In his interview, Stover said that no outby miner responded before he started the belts, and he did not expect anyone to do so unless they noticed a hazard.Mine Examination PracticesThe belt examiners at the mine utilized three-wheeled, battery-operated personnel carriers to conduct the majority of the conveyor belt examinations. \xa0They travelled along the wide side of the conveyor belt where possible and examined the areas around belt heads on foot. \xa0They examined both sides of the belt at transfer points and recorded their DTIs at all locations. \xa0In order to cross the belts, examiners were supposed to use crossunders located at the rear of the belt drives or crossovers available at the outby end of the belt junction points. \xa0Mine Tracking SystemThe mine uses an MSHA approved tracking system manufactured by Pyott Boone Electronics (PBE) Group.\xa0 Miners wear or carry tracking devices in pouches so their locations can be tracked.\xa0 The devices transmit a signal, and receivers throughout the mine receive the signal and provide the miner’s location to a system computer.\xa0 The computer retains a log of the information from each receiver for a period of two weeks.The tracking system log shows that Adkins was at the No. 2 belt transfer at 4:29 a.m.\xa0 At 4:30 a.m., Adkins’ location was picked up by a receiver on the surface.\xa0 This tracking indicates that Adkins attempted to cross the conveyor belt just outby the No. 2 belt rock box, fell onto the conveyor, and was carried outside. \xa0Adkins’ device signal was tracked from the No. 9 belt drive between the Slip Ridge Cedar Grove mine and the Coon Cedar Groove mine on the conveyor belt system, to the No. 8 belt drive and the No. 7 belt drive in the Coon Cedar Grove Mine, where the signal was lost. \xa0This indicates that the conveyor system carried Adkins to the surface when that operation started at 6:03 a.m. and through the series of underground mines to the processing plant, 7.2 miles away.\xa0 The tracking device was not recovered.No. 2 Belt Transfer and No. 1 BeltThe No. 2 belt transfer, near where Adkins fell, was constructed with four-foot by eight-foot sheets of metal plating welded together to form a steel chute with angled deflector walls.\xa0 This steel chute, called a “rock box,” funneled mined material onto the No. 1 conveyor belt to minimize spillage. \xa0At this location, there were 37 ½ inches of clearance between the belt and the roof.Investigators found smudges and chalk marks on the roof bolt plates above the belt directly in front of the rock box.\xa0 This indicated that the plates had been used as handholds while the examiners crossed the belt. \xa0The tracks indicated that the examiners stepped up on a water line lying beside the belt structure, stood on the belt structure, reached over to the roof bolt plates, and stepped across the conveyor belt onto the opposite belt structure and the ground. \xa0This crossing was apparently used as a shortcut instead of the nearest crossunder, which was 95 feet away (see Appendix B).The belt was suspended from the roof by chains spaced every ten feet for the entire length of the belt. \xa0The clearance between the roof and the belt was as small as twenty inches, making it extremely difficult for a miner to exit the fast-moving belt after falling.The No. 2 belt transfer was well illuminated so that mine examiners could see the area.\xa0 Start and stop controls were present at the portal, behind the take-up unit and at the nine and 12 breaks.\xa0 The start and stop controls functioned properly and could be accessed from both sides of the conveyor belt.Experience and TrainingAdkins began his employment at the Horse Creek Mine in February of 2016, as a mine examiner and belt man.\xa0 A review of Adkins’ training records showed he received experienced miner training on February 29, 2016, annual refresher training in March of 2016 and 2017, and certified person training on April 29, 2017.\xa0 Adkins received his underground mine foreman certification from the State of West Virginia on March 25, 2011.\xa0 He was certified as an emergency medical technician (EMT) on December 28, 2016.\xa0 Adkins’ training was up to date and in compliance with Part 48 of the CFR.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 A root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.\xa0Listed below is the root cause identified during the investigation and the operator’s implemented corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident:1.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Root Cause: \xa0Proper safety procedures were not followed while performing a conveyor belt examination.Corrective Action: The mine operator installed belt crossovers at all belt transfer points. \xa0These crossovers are located at the belt tailpieces and prevent the use of belt tailpieces as a means to cross the belts.\xa0 All crossovers, mid-belt crossovers, and crossunders were evaluated and modified, relocated, added or removed as appropriate.\xa0 All miners were trained to use these suitable belt crossing facilities.Also, the mine operator installed a visual and audible pre-start alarm at each underground tailpiece, which alarms 10 seconds before the startup of the belt, as well as lights along the No. 1 conveyor belt and pull cord plugs at each remote belt switch along the conveyor belt. \xa0These plugs are hung across the conveyor belt so that a person can reach them to stop the belt.\xa0', 'CONCLUSION': 'On October 23, 2017, at approximately 4:29 a.m., James R. Adkins, a 48-year-old mine examiner with 18 years of mining experience fell onto a moving conveyor belt and received fatal injuries.\xa0 Adkins was attempting to cross the conveyor belt at the tailpiece in order to complete his examination of the belt, when he fell.\xa0 He had been assigned to conduct a pre-shift examination of the No. 1, 2, and 3 conveyor belts, electrical boxes and track entry of the Horse Creek Eagle mine for the day shift.The accident occurred because the operator did not follow proper safety procedures.Approved by:\xa0\xa0--------------------------------------------------------\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ------------------------------David S.

Chesney, a 20-year old plant operator, was fatally injured on September 5, 2017, while working near an operating belt conveyor.\xa0 The victim was found beneath the hopper entangled in the tail pulley of the short feed conveyor.The accident occurred because the mine operator did not: (1) have a guard secured in place prior to operating the conveyor; (2) provide appropriate task training to the victim so he understood the hazards associated with the work being performed; and (3) conduct adequate workplace examinations to identify hazards so appropriate corrective actions could be taken.\u2003', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'Emery Pit, a surface construction sand and gravel mine owned and operated by G S Materials Inc., is located in Candor, Montgomery County, North Carolina.\xa0 The principal operating official is Ronnie G. Kirkpatrick Sr., President.\xa0 The mine regularly operates one 10-hour shift per day, five days per week.\xa0 The mine typically operates a partial shift on Saturday and frequently operates on Sunday as well.\xa0 Total employment is 17 persons.Excavators extract material from the pit and load it into haul trucks for transport to two processing locations, the CDE and Kolberg plants.\xa0 Machinery washes and screens the material and then conveys it into stockpiles.\xa0 The operator sells the finished products for use in a variety of construction industries, including golf course development.\xa0 The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on June 21, 2017.', 'DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On September 5, 2017, Dillon P. Chesney (victim) reported to work at 7:00 a.m., his normal starting time.\xa0 Mine manager Scott Kirkpatrick and mine superintendent Sammy Reagan talked with miners gathered in the parking lot about personnel issues and then discussed plans for the day.Because the CDE plant was scheduled to be shut down for maintenance, Reagan told Kirkpatrick to make certain someone started the water pumps so the Kolberg plant could operate.\xa0 Chesney was assigned that task, which he completed by 9:30 a.m.\xa0 He then arrived at the Kolberg plant shortly before 10:00 a.m.Michael Everett, floater, was operating a front-end loader in the Kolberg plant area, pushing up sand dumped by haul trucks from the pit into a stockpile.\xa0 Everett planned to load the feed chute once Chesney arrived to start it.\xa0 Around 10:00 a.m., Michael Bowden, a loader operator normally assigned to feed material, arrived to relieve Everett so he could load customer trucks by the CDE plant.Bowden and Chesney installed screws in the skirt rubber on the short feed conveyor beneath the feed hopper.\xa0 Chesney told Bowden he was going to the CDE plant to help with repairs after he made sure everything was running properly at the Kolberg plant.\xa0 \xa0\xa0Chesney started the Kolberg plant from the control room, and Bowden dumped material in the feed hopper for approximately ten minutes until he was replaced by Gilbert Chavez, the loader operator normally assigned to the CDE plant.\xa0 Bowden left the area at 10:30 a.m. to operate an excavator. \xa0Bowden returned to the Kolberg plant at 11:17 a.m., and saw Chesney’s pickup truck still parked by the plant.\xa0 Chavez was still loading material in the feed hopper and the plant was producing material.\xa0 Bowden started looking for Chesney and found him beneath the hopper entangled in the tail pulley of the short feed conveyor.\xa0 Bowden called Kirkpatrick and was told to call Monica Bruce at the scale house.\xa0 Bruce called 911 at 11:23 a.m.\xa0 Kirkpatrick called Reagan at approximately 11:30 a.m. and told him Chesney “was in trouble”.\xa0 The first EMS responders arrived at 11:39 a.m. and medical examiner Andy Sanders pronounced Chesney dead at 11:41 a.m.The medical examiner attributed the cause of death to multiple blunt force traumas to head and torso.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'Monica Bruce, Scale House Operator, called the Department of Labor’s National Contact Center (DOLNCC) at 11:53 a.m. on September 5, 2017.\xa0 The DOLNCC contacted Michael Evans, Safety Specialist, Southeastern District, and MSHA immediately began an investigation.MSHA initially issued an order pursuant to Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act), as amended.\xa0 The agency subsequently modified the order to a Section 103(k) order upon arrival of an Authorized Representative.MSHA’s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, and reviewed training and work procedures relevant to the accident. \xa0MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of North Carolina Department of Labor and mine management.\xa0 There were no eye witnesses to the accident.', 'DISCUSSION': 'LocationThe accident occurred beneath the Kolberg plant feed hopper at the tail section of the short feed conveyor.Investigators found the tail pulley guard on the floor underneath the conveyor, approximately 6 feet in front of the tail pulley.\xa0 Someone had removed both the tail pulley and head pulley guards.\xa0 Investigators learned the guarding had been removed to replace the belt and rollers six days prior to the accident and that the operator used the conveyor for production for three days without replacing the guarding.\xa0 The tail pulley guard was equipped with slots cut out on the back so belt tracking adjustments could be performed with the guard secured in place and therefore there was no reason to remove the guard to make an adjustment.\xa0Investigators found a light weight, portable, aluminum work platform below and slightly behind the victim; tipped over backwards with the standing surface facing the opposite direction of the conveyor. \xa0The platform was 39½ inches long and 12 inches wide, and, when upright, measured 20 inches tall.\xa0 Investigators noted that Chesney appeared to have been standing on the platform when the accident occurred, based upon the height of the conveyor from the ground.\xa0 Investigators believe Chesney was working by the right side of the conveyor in front of the tail pulley.\xa0 When EMS arrived, they found his feet suspended above the floor approximately 6 inches, and observed a crescent wrench on the floor beneath the conveyor; the tool was bent to the curvature of the drum.The right side pillow block bearing that supports the shaft to the frame rail was completely removed and the left side was loosened from the frame.\xa0 The conveyor belt was slack but intact and not separated.\xa0 EMS responders had to disconnect the pulley shaft from the right side and shift it off of the frame rail in order to extract the victim’s body.ConveyorThe investigation team was unable to determine the manufacturer of the short feed conveyor. \xa0The feed conveyor is powered by a Baldor Reliance 230/460 volt, 15 HP, 1765 RPM motor and uses 460-volt, 3-phase power and a variable speed control to maintain optimal flow of material from the hopper.\xa0WeatherThe weather condition around the time of the accident was partly cloudy with a temperature of 79 degrees Fahrenheit and light winds. \xa0Investigators did not consider weather to be a factor in the accident.Training and ExperienceDillon P. Chesney had 23 weeks of mining experience at this operation with no prior mining experience. \xa0A representative from MSHA’s Educational Field and Small Mine Services conducted an in-depth review of the mine operator’s training records and Part 46 Training Plan.\xa0 The victim did not receive task training for performing maintenance or repairs, and investigators found no documentation indicating he received training as a plant operator.\xa0 The victim received only task training as a laborer and mobile equipment operator.\xa0 The Part 46 Training Plan did not include procedures or training methods for performing maintenance and repairs and plant operation.\xa0 \xa0 \xa0', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'Investigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified the following root causes:Root Cause:\xa0 Management did not have a guard secured in place prior to operating the conveyor\nCorrective Action:\xa0 Management revised the Training Plan and incorporated policies with respect to the use of guarding, and provided miners with appropriate training.\xa0 Additional guarding was also installed.Root Cause:\xa0 Management did not provide appropriate task training to the victim so he understood the hazards associated with the work being performed.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 Management provided miners with task training in proper workplace examinations, conveyor safety, conveyor guarding, plant operator guidelines, and locking and tagging out requirements and procedures.Root Cause:\xa0 Management did not conduct adequate workplace examinations to identify hazards so appropriate corrective actions could be taken.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 Management introduced comprehensive workplace examination policies related to identifying hazardous conditions and provided training to the miners.', 'CONCLUSION': 'Dillon P. Chesney died after becoming entangled in the unguarded tail pulley of a belt conveyor.\xa0 The accident occurred because the mine operator did not make sure that guarding was in place prior to placing the belt conveyor into operation; and did not have a competent person conduct adequate workplace examinations and correct hazards.', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'Issued to G S Materials Inc.Order No.

Mosley, District Manager', 'OVERVIEW': 'On Friday August 25, 2017, at approximately 12:08 p.m., Owen Jones, a 51-year-old mine examiner with over 27 years of mining experience fell onto a moving conveyor belt and received fatal injuries.\xa0 Jones was attempting to cross the conveyor belt to complete his examination of the belt when he fell.The fatal accident occurred because the crossover provided by the operator was \xa0not suitable for Jones and other miners to use as a means to cross over the belt when it was moving.\xa0 In addition, the operator had not installed a guard to prevent Jones from crossing over the conveyor belt in an unsafe manner.\xa0', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': '\xa0The Pleasant Hill Mine, an underground mine in the Sewell coal seam, is located near Mill Creek in Randolph County, West Virginia. \xa0It is operated by the Carter Roag Coal Company.\xa0 The mine employs 192 persons, 156 underground.\xa0 The mine operates two production shifts and one maintenance shift five days a week.\xa0 The mine produces 1,968 tons of raw coal daily from two continuous mining machine sections. \xa0A conveyor system transports coal from the sections to the surface through one of the six drift openings. \xa0An elevator is used to transport miners in and out of the mine.\xa0 The mine is ventilated with a blowing fan. \xa0The mine liberates over 1.2 million cubic feet of methane in a 24-hour period and is on a five day spot inspection schedule in accordance with Section 103(i) of the Mine Act.The principal officers at this mine at the time of this accident were:Chris Couch……………………… Mine ManagerFred Watson……………………...\xa0 General Mine ForemanBrad Summerfield……………….\xa0 Production SuperintendentCurtis Bailey……………………...\xa0 Production SuperintendentKelvin Napier…………………….\xa0 Safety ManagerAt the time of the accident, a regular (E01) safety and health inspection was in progress.\xa0 The previous E01 inspection was completed on June 28, 2017.\xa0 The non-fatal days lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for the Pleasant Hill Mine for 2016 was 3.36 compared to the national NFDL rate of 3.24 for mines of this type.\xa0', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': '\xa0On Friday, August 25, 2017, Owen Jones started his shift at 6:30 a.m. \xa0He traveled in a battery-powered mantrip to Zone 2, his usual work area, to clean, perform maintenance, and correct problems on the conveyor belts.\xa0 Jones then traveled to Zone 1 to conduct examinations.\xa0 Jones did not typically work in that area but was assigned to it that day by Mine Foreman Fred Watson because the regular Zone 1 examiner was absent.\xa0Jones wrote the first date, time, and initials (DTI) on a date board at 11:30 a.m. at the No. 3 belt transfer.\xa0 \xa0He then proceeded to examine Zone 1, by driving the mantrip along the No. 2 conveyor belt.\xa0 The belt is installed so\xa0 the distance on one side to the coal rib is wider than the other side (wide side).\xa0 Jones drove on the wide side and parked so he could examine the No. 2 transfer .\xa0 He placed his DTI on the wide side date board at 11:58 a.m.\xa0 A date board present on the other side (tight side) of the transfer did not have any DTI from him that day.There were no witnesses to the accident.\xa0 However, the mine tracking system and other evidence gathered during the investigation indicate that Jones fell onto the moving conveyor belt as he attempted to cross the belt while it was moving.\xa0 A wooden crossover structure was located 10 feet away. There was no \xa0evidence to indicate that miners were using it.James Yoakum, Outside Yard Man, was checking the conveyor belt for spillage shortly after 2:00 p.m. when he discovered Jones on the ground under the canopy at the pit mouth (see Appendix A).\xa0 Yoakum yelled for Jonathan Sexton and Matthew Ison, Contract Utility Miners working in the yard, to help. \xa0Sexton traveled to Jones and was unable to detect a pulse.\xa0 Yoakum went to the mine phone and called Thomas Lindsay, Dispatcher, to tell him he needed help because a man was down. \xa0Lindsay called Roger Debar, Warehouse Manager, who called 911 at 2:12 p.m.\xa0Several individuals, including emergency medical technicians (EMT), immediately responded to the accident. \xa0The EMTs confirmed Jones had no pulse and determined no first aid would be performed due to the extent of his injuries.\xa0 Couch and Bailey, who had also traveled to the scene, placed Jones on a back board.The Randolph County Emergency Squad arrived on the scene at 2:42 p.m.\xa0 Dr. Hundley at the WVU Medical Command, pronounced Jones dead at 2:51 p.m\xa0 after he consulted with the squad,. \xa0The squad then transported Jones via ambulance to the Davis Medical Center in Elkins, West Virginia.\xa0', 'INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT': '\xa0The Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center was notified of the accident on August 25, 2017, at 2:19 p.m.\xa0 The DOL Contact Center notified Michael Stark, Staff Assistant in the Morgantown District Office who then notified the mine operator of its obligation to preserve the accident scene and that an investigator was traveling to the mine.\xa0 Stark assigned Joedy Gutta, Coal Mine Safety & Health Specialist - Impoundments, and Tyler Peddicord, Coal Mine Safety & Health Specialist – Ventilation, to investigate the accident.\xa0 Steven Stankus, Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, traveled to the site and verbally issued a 103(k) order upon arrival.The accident investigation was conducted in conjunction with the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST) and the Carter Roag Coal Company. \xa0Before going underground, the team conducted preliminary interviews with persons having knowledge of the facts and circumstances concerning the accident.Investigators took photographs of the equipment and accident site (see Appendix B).\xa0 A survey crew developed sketches of the pit mouth area where Jones was found and of the No. 2 belt transfer area (see Appendix C).MSHA and WVOMHST conducted formal interviews on August 29, 2017, at the MSHA District 3 Bridgeport Field Office.\xa0 A list of persons interviewed and participating in the accident investigation is in appendix D.\xa0', 'DISCUSSION': '\xa0Accident SiteThe accident site was identified by the parked mantrip Jones had been operating, the mine tracking system, and the physical evidence present at the No. 2 belt transfer point.WVOMHST conducted tests for stray electrical currents in the area.\xa0 None were identified. \xa0The conveyor belt start and stop switches provided at the No. 2 belt transfer were also tested and found to function properly.Mine Examination PracticesThe belt examiners utilize three-wheeled battery-operated mantrips to conduct the majority of the conveyor belt line examinations.\xa0 They travel along the wide side of the conveyor belt.\xa0 Crossovers are provided at locations where it is necessary to cross over the conveyor belt and examine the tight side of the belt.\xa0 It is a mine practice for the examiners to examine both sides of the belt at transfer points and record their DTI at those locations.Mine Tracking SystemThe mine utilizes an MSHA approved tracking system manufactured by Matrix Design Group, LLC.\xa0 The system utilizes transmitters called “tags” attached to miners’ hard hats, and these “tags” transmit an electromagnetic signal approximately every two seconds.\xa0 Antennae throughout the mine receive the signal and communicate the location of the tag (and the miner) to a system computer.\xa0 The system makes a log of miners’ locations.The tracking system log shows Jones was at No. 2 belt transfer point in Zone 1 at 11:54 a.m.\xa0 At 11:57 a.m, he was located at No. 32 block on No. 1 conveyor belt, a distance of approximately 1,625 feet.\xa0 At 11:59 a.m., he was located at No. 2 block. \xa0This information is consistent with the speed of the conveyor belt and also indicates the accident occurred at the No. 2 transfer point.\xa0 The system log shows that his tracker was outside the mine in the yard at 12:06 p.m.The investigation team examined the tracking system due to the time discrepancies on the date board and the times logged in the system for Jones’ locations.\xa0 The tracking system clock was found to be approximately 14 minutes behind eastern daylight time.No. 2 Belt TransferThe No. 2 belt transfer was constructed with flat steel covers over both sides of the conveyor belt (see photos in Appendix B). \xa0The covers are approximately 32 inches above the mine floor. \xa0The opening between the covers, where the conveyor belt is exposed, measures 29 inches. \xa0Steel skirt boards extend vertically four and a half inches above both covers along the opening.\xa0 The average clearance between the flat covers and the mine roof is 58 inches.\xa0 Mined material leaves the No. 2 conveyor belt at a belt discharge roller located inside a steel chute with angled deflector walls.\xa0 This steel chute, called a “rock box,” funnels the material onto the No. 1 conveyor belt.Footprints were detected in the rock dust on the flat covers at the No. 2 transfer point.\xa0 Handprints were found on the angled deflector on the tight side of the rock box. \xa0Vertical streaking marks were in the dust on the inside and outside of this angled deflector measuring 25 inches in length. \xa0The evidence indicates Jones was utilizing the outby side of the No. 2 transfer to cross over the moving No. 1 conveyor belt to travel to the tight side of the conveyor belt. \xa0Investigators believe the streaking marks were made by Jones as he fell onto the conveyor belt.CrossoverThe crossover located 10 feet from where Jones fell onto the belt was constructed approximately 6 months before the fatal accident.\xa0 The vertical support members were six inch by six inch timbers wedged to the mine roof.\xa0 The floor and sides were one inch thick boards. \xa0The crossover was 27 inches wide and 74 inches across the conveyor belt.\xa0 The floor boards were an average of 46.5 inches above the mine floor, leaving only 34 inches to 37 inches of clearance to the mine roof.The dimensions of the crossover made it difficult to use. \xa0A miner would not have enough width to turn on top of the crossover and climb down feet first. \xa0Evidence gathered by investigators showed that it was not being used by miners, including mine examiners.\xa0 Thick rock dust was evenly deposited and undisturbed on the crossover.\xa0 If miners had used the crossover, the rock dust would have been disturbed.The distance from the coal on the conveyor belt to the bottom of the crossover was approximately six inches. \xa0Investigators identified locations along the No. 1 conveyor belt where Jones contacted the crossover and mine roof while he was on the conveyor belt.\xa0 Jones was found lying face down under the canopy at the pit mouth.\xa0 A hold down roller installed near this location may have expelled Jones from the conveyor belt.Previous SafeguardOn May 25, 2010, an inspector attempted to use a crossover to cross the No. 1 belt while the belt was moving.\xa0 A portion of the crossover broke and created an opening that a person could fall through.\xa0 The inspector issued a notice to provide a safeguard requiring suitable crossing facilities in the mine where it is necessary for miners to cross moving conveyor belts.General Machine InformationThe conveyor belt involved in the accident is a Firewall II manufactured by Cobra America. \xa0The No. 1 conveyor belt line is 60 blocks long. \xa0It exits the mine from the number four pit mouth entry and dumps onto the outside stacker belt. \xa0The conveyor belt is 48 inches wide.\xa0 The No. 1 conveyor belt structure hangs from the mine roof with metal chains from the pit mouth to the 33 block. \xa0The conveyor belt structure is on the mine floor from the 33 block to the 57 block. \xa0Conveyor belt start and stop switches are located every 1,000 feet along the conveyor belts and at the No. 2 belt transfer.Training RecordsWilliam K. Roberts, MSHA Training Specialist, reviewed the training records.\xa0 Jones had been employed at this mine since March 20, 2016. \xa0He had 27 years of mining experience and his last annual refresher training was conducted on February 16, 2017. \xa0He had also received task training on various tasks and the training was up to date.\xa0 Five non-contributory training citations were issued for violations of 30 CFR 48.9 (a) because the training forms were not completed properly.\xa0\xa0', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': '\xa0MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 Root causes was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root causes identified during the investigation and the operator’s implemented corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident.Root Cause: \xa0The mine operator did not provide an adequate crossover outby the No. 2 belt drive for miners to safely cross the moving No. 1 conveyor belt.\nCorrective Action: The mine operator removed the crossover and constructed an adequate crossover for miners to use (see Appendix F).Root Cause: \xa0The configuration of the drive on the outby side of the rock box was not constructed to prevent a miner from using it as means to cross the moving conveyor belt.\nCorrective Action: \xa0The mine operator installed guards at certain belt transfer locations to prevent miners from using them as a means to cross a moving conveyor belt.\xa0\xa0', 'CONCLUSION': '\xa0On August 25, 2017, while conducting an examination of the No. 1 conveyor belt, the victim attempted to cross in an unsafe location, fell onto the moving belt and received fatal injuries as the belt transported him out of the mine.\xa0The fatal accident occurred because the operator did not provide an adequate crossover for Jones and other miners to use as a means to cross over the belt.\xa0 In addition, the operator had not installed a guard to prevent Jones from utilizing the transfer point as a means to cross the conveyor belt.\xa0Signed

Four crew members saw Stevens at the filter location or spoke with him during their lunch break.\xa0 Peterson was the last to see Stevens prior to the accident.\xa0 He spoke to Stevens sometime between 9:30 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., while Stevens was going for a drink of water.At 1:20 a.m., August 3, 2017, Peterson traveled to where Stevens was working to tell him the shift had ended.\xa0 Peterson discovered the water box attached to the filter had fallen on Stevens, pinning him underneath.\xa0 Stevens did not respond when Peterson touched his legs. Peterson went to the 3rd floor and at 1:28 a.m. made an emergency radio call to Dennis Tripplet, AMS Operator and Security Guard, to inform him of the accident.\xa0 Tripplet called 911 and notified the miners in the shower room to go help at the accident scene.\xa0Peterson along with Richard Morgan, Prep Plant Operator and Emergency Medical Technician, and Brandon Chandler, Preparation Plant Operator, arrived and examined Stevens.\xa0 Morgan did not detect a pulse and discovered that Stevens was cool to the touch.\xa0 Peterson, Morgan, and Chandler used come-alongs and chains to lift the water box off of Stevens.\xa0 Derick Atwood, Haul Truck Operator, and Chandler brought a stretcher and placed Stevens onto it. \xa0They took Stevens to the first floor to wait for the ambulance.\xa0 At 2:30 a.m., the Rangely District Hospital Ambulance arrived and examined Stevens.\xa0 The ambulance crew contacted the county coroner.\xa0 Roy Kinney, Rio Blanco County Coroner arrived and pronounced Stevens dead at 3:23 a.m. on August 3, 2017.', 'INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT': 'On August 3, 2017, at 1:38 a.m., Tripplet called the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center and reported a serious accident.\xa0 The Contact Center notified Matthew Lemons, District 9 Coal Mine Safety and Health Roof Control Supervisor, of the accident at 1:53 a.m.\xa0 Lemons notified Peter Saint, District 9 Coal Mine Safety and Health Electrical Supervisor.Saint verbally issued a 103(j) order to Tripplet at 4:20 a.m. \xa0Tripplet notified Tony Gabossi, Shift Foreman, of the order and the accident scene was secured.Saint and Rufus Taylor, District 9 Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, arrived at the mine at 6:35 a.m.\xa0 Upon arrival Taylor modified the 103(j) order to a 103(k) order to ensure the safety of all persons at the site, including those involved in the accident investigation.\xa0 Saint and Taylor initiated the accident investigation by taking photographs and measurements of the scene and investigating the physical evidence of the accident.\xa0 Deserado personnel who were present at the accident scene were interviewed.\xa0Tain Curtis, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Roof Control Specialist/Accident Investigator, was notified of the accident on August 3, 2017 at 3:34 a.m.\xa0 Curtis arrived at the mine at 8:30 a.m.\xa0 James Preece, MSHA Assistant District Manager, was also notified of the accident and arrived at the mine at approximately 8:30 a.m.\xa0 Curtis and Preece continued the investigation of the accident scene and took digital photographs, relevant measurements, and sketches of the scene.On August 3, 2017, Fred Sanchez, Supervisory Educational Field and Small Mine Services Training Specialist, traveled to the mine and conducted a thorough review of training and examination records.Investigators completed the investigation of the scene of the accident on August 3, 2017. \xa0The investigation was conducted in conjunction with Deserado company representatives and United Mine Workers of America representatives.\xa0 MSHA conducted formal interviews on August 7 and 14, 2017 at the mine. \xa0The list of persons participating and those interviewed are listed in Appendix A.', 'DISCUSSION': '\xa0DismantlingThe Deserado Mine had begun a major overhaul of its preparation plant.\xa0 Prior to the dismantling project, the water box, which is associated with the rotary filter system, supplied water and coal slurry to the coal filter.\xa0 During this project, Stevens had been directed to dismantle the filter in the inactive section of the preparation plant.\xa0 Because he was an experienced miner, mine management allowed Stevens to decide how he would dismantle the filter and structure, and he worked alone.On the day of the accident, Stevens was planning to continue dismantling the filter.\xa0 He had previously removed the filter assembly but the water box still needed to be dismantled.\xa0 He used a plasma cutter to cut the metal water box into smaller manageable pieces, and then lowered them from the 3rd floor to the 2nd floor. \xa0Stevens had made cuts along the trough underneath the filter housing to allow the water box to separate.\xa0 He left 1-inch wide strips of metal on both ends in an apparent attempt to hold the water box in place as it was being dismantled.\xa0 The east end of the water box was attached to the filter tub. \xa0Stevens had made a cut in this area to separate the water box from the filter tub.\xa0 After the cuts were made, the box was only supported on the east end by a 1-inch wide strip of metal that tapered down to ¾ inches wide. \xa0\xa0The accident occurred when the water box shifted and fell on top of Stevens (see Appendix B).\xa0 Adequate blocking material had not been installed to support the water box.Investigators determined from the location of Stevens’ body that he had positioned himself under the water box.\xa0 The east end of the water box fell approximately 29 inches, pinning Stevens’ upper body to the floor.\xa0 The mine’s engineering department estimated that the water box weighed about 1,400 pounds.Securely Blocking Against MotionWhen performing work under machinery or equipment that has been raised, the machinery or equipment is required to be securely blocked against motion.\xa0 Instead of properly blocking the water box against motion prior to beginning to take it apart, Stevens depended on the 1-inch wide strip of metal he cut on the east end and the 3-inch wide strip on the west end to support the water box.ExaminationsBecause the work area where the accident occurred is located in the surface area of an underground mine, on-shift examinations were not required and were not conducted.Training and ExperienceStevens started his employment at the Deserado mining operation on February 28, 2011.\xa0 He had six years and 20 weeks experience at the mine and had been in his current position as a surface mechanic for two years and 23 weeks.\xa0 Stevens had 12 years 40 weeks of total mining experience.Training records reviewed indicated that Stevens’ training was up-to-date, and in accordance with 30 CFR § Part 48. \xa0He was task trained for blocking against motion on May 5, 2017.\xa0 He was also task trained on cutting and welding on April 14, 2012, and had site-specific training on the mine operators’ Safe Operating Guidelines on May 24, 2017, which also addressed blocking against motion.\xa0 He received annual refresher training on March 20, 2017.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 A root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the investigation and the operator’s implemented corrective actions to prevent a reoccurrence of this type of accident.\xa0Root Cause:\xa0 Mine management did not ensure that machinery or materials being worked on were securely blocked against motion prior to work being performed.\xa0 The water box was cut loose from the trough and was not secured against motion.\xa0 The metal strip that was left to hold the water box in place on the east end was not sufficient.\xa0 This support allowed the water box to shift and fall on the victim\nCorrective Action:\xa0 Mine management developed a plan for the remaining dismantling of the preparation plant trough and trained all employees to ensure safe completion of the project.\xa0 Management will continue to review plans with miners to ensure blocking against motion of all material and equipment in future projects.', 'CONCLUSION': '\xa0On Thursday, August 3, 2017, at approximately 1:30 a.m., Jason Stevens, a 32-year-old surface mechanic with 12 years of mining experience, received fatal injuries while he was dismantling a water box.\xa0 The water box fell and struck Stevens and pinned him to the floor of the preparation plant.The accident occurred because the mine operator did not ensure that the water box being dismantled was securely blocked against motion during the dismantling process. \xa0\xa0Signed

The ore is then milled, concentrated, and smelted into copper plates. The finished product is sold to commercial industries.\nThe Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection of this operation on May 18, 2017.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On July 27, 2017, Gabriel Benitez (victim) began work at 7:00 p.m. Brian\nSamuelson, Shifter, assigned Benitez cable handler duties for this shift. After conducting a pre-operational inspection of the F-550 cable handler (pickup) truck, Benitez went to work.At 8:20 p.m., Benitez drove the F-550 cable handler truck to the 3450 dump site, passing Erik Lopez, Equipment Operator, who was operating a rubber-tired dozer. Benitez parked his truck at the north end of the dump site, next to a wind row of material used to delineate the western boundary of the dump site. The cab of Benitez’s truck was facing south and the truck’s operating lights and strobe light had been turned off. Personal cell phone records indicate that Benitez had been using his cellphone while he was at the dump site.At 8:33 p.m., Johnny Tynes, Heavy Truck Operator, entered the 3450 dump site in a Komatsu 930E-4, 320-ton haul truck, company number 316. Lopez directed Tynes to begin dumping further north (Figure 1). After dumping his load, Tynes began leaving the dump site.

Inspector’s Office, miners and their representatives.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred on the 3450 dump site.\xa0 The trucks were on the west side of the dump, progressively dumping from the north end to the south end.\xa0 Immediately prior to the accident, the dumping location had been repositioned to the north end of the dump to restart the dumping cycle.\xa0Pickup TruckThe investigation showed the pickup truck involved in the accident was a 2012, Ford F-550 4X2 standard cab truck.\xa0 The truck was completely destroyed in the accident.\xa0 An information download of the truck’s black box revealed no useful information.\xa0 Investigators determined the truck was equipped with a flashing beacon light and reflective flag attached to an antenna that was approximately twelve feet above the ground.Investigators found the vehicle light switch in the off position.\xa0 Witness statements indicated the beacon strobe light and the vehicle lights were not on at the time of the accident.\xa0Haul TruckThe investigation revealed the haul truck involved in the accident was a 2012, Komatsu 930E-4E rigid frame rear dump truck with an alternating current electric-drive system. \xa0Investigators noted the truck was equipped with a Komatsu, SSDA16V160, diesel engine, and all lights and other safety equipment were functional.Dumpsite IlluminationInvestigators found one light plant at the 3450 dump site, but it was positioned facing the previous dump location.\xa0 The operator did not reposition the light when the dump site moved to the north, and the victim’s location at the 3450 dump site was not illuminated at the time of the accident.\xa0 Additionally, investigators observed only three of the four lights of the light plant were operational.Haul Truck Operator View TestsInvestigators conducted a re-creation of the accident with haul trucks 316 and 390 at approximately the same time of day the accident occurred. \xa0Shifter Brian Samuelson placed the dump site light plant mast in its original position (the light had been repositioned during recovery operations), and observers noted truck 316 had a blind spot of approximately 30 feet directly in front of it.\xa0 The re-creation provided evidence that the victim’s truck was not easily visible while exiting the dump.Weather\nInvestigators noted the weather at the time of the accident was cloudy with light rain and a temperature of approximately 79º F.\xa0 Visibility played a role in the accident.Traffic ControlInvestigators reviewed the operator’s procedures for traffic control, right-of-way, and direction of movement.\xa0 The operator had no procedures to address light duty trucks on dump sites.\xa0 According to interviews and on-site observations, the dump site is one of the few areas of the mine where cell phone coverage is available.\xa0 Cell phone records indicate that Benitez had been using his cell phone while he was at the dump site.\xa0 In addition, interviews indicated that persons regularly used the dump site during the night shift for various unknown reasons that were not work-related.', 'TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE':

control the movement of light duty vehicles in the dump areas.\xa0 Management failed to ensure that light duty vehicles were only in the area to conduct work related activities.Corrective Action: Management established new procedures in the mine's “Pit Driving Training” policy titled “Approaching and Leaving an Active Dump”.\xa0 The new policy designates how light duty vehicles, service trucks and support utility trucks will interact with active dump areas.\xa0 Management trained all miners regarding these new policies and procedures.Root Cause: Management had not established a procedure to ensure dump sites are properly illuminated to safely light the active dumping areas.Corrective Action: Management established a “Mine Supervisor Developmental Training Plan”, which addresses lighting

Riley, District Manager', 'OVERVIEW': ""\xa0On Tuesday, July 25, 2017, Andrew J. Oxenrider, a 28-year-old equipment operator, with seven years and nine months of total mining experience was fatally injured while operating a Caterpillar D9L bulldozer on a refuse bank.\xa0 The accident occurred when the victim, who was working alone, was run over by the bulldozer.\xa0 Investigators believe that shortly before the accident, the victim exited the bulldozer onto the slope of the refuse bank and into the bulldozer’s push path near the edge of the refuse bank.Because the manufacturer’s parking procedure was not followed, the bulldozer moved downhill after the victim exited it.\xa0 When the bulldozer hit the victim, he was positioned between the track and blade.\xa0 \xa0The bulldozer did not stop but traveled over the edge of the refuse pile and came to rest at the bottom of the embankment. \xa0There were no witnesses to the accident.The fatal accident occurred because the manufacturer’s braking procedure was not followed.\xa0 Also, the mine operator did not adequately task train the victim in accordance with its approved training plan, which included training on the safe operating procedures outlined in the CAT D9L operator's manual for parking the bulldozer on a grade. \xa0In addition, the mine operator did not maintain the braking system of the bulldozer in a safe operating condition.\xa0"", 'GENERAL INFORMATION': '\xa0The New St. Nicholas Breaker, operated by Reading Anthracite Company, and located in Pottsville, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, is an active surface facility used to separate anthracite coal from refuse material.\xa0 Bulldozers are used to move these materials from a storage bank to a screening pad area.\xa0 Portable screening plants separate the anthracite coal from the refuse material. \xa0The marketable product that results from this process is then hauled away with trucks.\xa0 The other material is placed in another refuse pile.\xa0 The facility employs 26 miners and operates two production shifts, six days a week.The principal officers for the facility at the time of the accident were:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Brian Rich ...................................................................................

47 refuse bank area of the mine.\xa0 He worked alone, operating a CAT D9L bulldozer to push material down the bank to a screening area pad where an excavator could load it into a screen at a later date.\xa0 Seth Huey, Foreman, also started his shift at 6:00 a.m., by conducting his job site examination. \xa0Huey drove through the bottom of the Oak Hill P – 47 operation to the screening area pad, observed no hazards, and drove away from the area.\xa0 At approximately 9:30 a.m., Huey drove to the Oak Hill P – 47 to meet Oxenrider on the road at the top of the refuse bank to give him further instructions. \xa0Huey sent Oxenrider a text message while he was on his way, but did not get a reply. \xa0Huey arrived at the top of the refuse bank, got out of his truck and stood on a berm, but he did not see Oxenrider’s bulldozer. \xa0Huey also called Oxenrider on his cellular telephone and did not get an answer. \xa0Huey drove back down to the screening area pad, assuming that Oxenrider was on the pad getting fuel.Huey arrived at the screening area pad and found the bulldozer, which was positioned blade first into the ground, at the bottom of the refuse bank. \xa0He ran toward the bulldozer and noticed that the engine was running at low idle and the door was open. \xa0Oxenrider was not in the bulldozer cab, and Huey saw him lying on the ground near the edge of the bank. \xa0Huey approached Oxenrider and observed that he had received fatal injuries.Huey immediately called Frank Derrick, General Manager, and told him to come right away because the bulldozer was over the bank and Oxenrider was lying on the ground.\xa0 Huey then called Riccardo Muntone, Vice President of Safety and Compliance. \xa0Derrick arrived at the bottom of the refuse bank. \xa0He called 911 at 9:42 a.m. and then traveled to the entrance gate and waited for emergency assistance to arrive.\xa0Schuylkill Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at the accident scene at 10:09 a.m. \xa0A front end loader was used to open a road for the EMS to travel to the scene in an all-terrain vehicle (ATV). \xa0After EMS evaluated Oxenrider, Andrew Szczyglak, Schuylkill County Deputy Coroner, arrived and pronounced Oxenrider dead at the scene at 11:05 a.m.\xa0', '\xa0': '', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': '\xa0Muntone called the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center at 10:03 a.m. A noncontributory citation was issued to the mine operator for a violation of 30 CFR § 50.10 because the mine operator did not contact MSHA immediately, at once, without delay, and within 15 minutes.On July 25, 2017, at 10:15 a.m., Randall Caramellino, MSHA District 2 Staff Assistant, was notified of the fatal accident by the DOL Contact Center.\xa0 Caramellino informed Patrick Boylan, Frackville Field Office Supervisor.\xa0 Boylan dispatched Stephen Kowalick, Coal Mine Inspector (CMI) and Joseph Draugelis, CMI and Accident Investigator, to the mine.\xa0 Upon his arrival at 10:35 a.m., Draugelis issued a 103(k) order to ensure the safety of all persons on site and to prevent the destruction of evidence that would aid in investigating the cause or causes of the accident.\xa0 Kowalick arrived at the same time as Draugelis, and Boylan arrived shortly after.Kowalick, Draugelis, and Boylan took photographs and gathered preliminary information. \xa0They also conducted initial interviews with the Reading Anthracite company management personnel who were present at the accident scene (see Appendix A).The accident investigation was conducted jointly with the Anthracite and Industrial Minerals Mine Safety Division of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).\xa0 United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) representatives and Reading Anthracite company management participated in the investigation.\xa0 A list of the persons who participated in the investigation is in Appendix A.\xa0Formal interviews were conducted by MSHA and DEP on July 26 and 31 and August 2, 10, and 16, 2017 at the Frackville Field Office.\xa0 All persons interviewed were involved in mining activity at the Oak Hill P – 47 Operation or had operated or maintained the bulldozer involved in the accident.The investigators obtained the service history of the bulldozer from the time it was rebuilt in 2004 by Fabco Equipment Inc., until the air conditioner was serviced by a company mechanic on July 20, 2017.Onsite testing and evaluation of the bulldozer was conducted by MSHA Technical Support on July 28 and 29, and on August 3 and 4, 2017.\xa0 Technical representatives and a mechanic from Cleveland Brothers Equipment Co. Inc. were present during the testing.\xa0 Evidence obtained from the bulldozer was removed and itemized through the MSHA chain of custody forms.\xa0', 'DISCUSSION': '\xa0', 'Accident Location': 'The accident occurred on the refuse bank approximately 400 yards from the mine entrance gate.\xa0 The bulldozer was used to push material along a path that was sloped to various degrees ranging from 17 to 20 degrees.\xa0 As the bulldozer pushed the refuse material, berms of material were created on both sides of the machine to various heights.\xa0 The berms ranged in height from 18 to 31 inches on one side of the bulldozer, and 36 to 60 inches on the other side.Because the manufacturer’s parking procedure was not followed, the bulldozer moved downhill after the victim exited the bulldozer.\xa0 After the bulldozer hit the victim, it travelled over the edge of the refuse pile and went down a 44 degree slope.\xa0 It traveled to the toe of the slope, and was found in the “laid” position (see Appendix C).\xa0 Because the blade dug in deeper than the 44 degree slope, the machine was actually at a 55 degree slope when it was found by investigators.', 'General Machine Information': 'The bulldozer involved in the fatal accident is a 1984 Caterpillar D9L track type tractor, serial number 14Y02387. \xa0It is equipped with a 9S bulldozer blade, a Caterpillar 3412 diesel engine with a power rating of 460 horsepower, and a power shift transmission with three speeds in both forward and reverse direction. \xa0The bulldozer uses an elevated type drive sprocket arrangement and weighs approximately 115,000 pounds, which includes the blade. \xa0The engine hour meter showed 26,281.1 hours of use.', 'Maintenance and Service Records': 'According to maintenance and service history records, the bulldozer was rebuilt by Fabco Equipment Inc., a Caterpillar dealer for the State of Wisconsin. \xa0The bulldozer\xa0was purchased by Reading Anthracite in December 2016. \xa0Investigators reviewed service, maintenance, and pre-operational check records provided by the mine operator, and they did not indicate any problems with the parking or service brake systems.', 'Testing and Evaluation': 'Investigators determined that the only damage the bulldozer sustained during the accident was to the right side of the windshield. The transmission was in the neutral position and the parking brake lever was in the released position. \xa0The bulldozer was able to start and operate without any repairs for the purpose of testing.', 'Function Test': 'Function testing revealed the following:The governor control lever and the decelerator foot pedal linkages were intact and moved throughout their range without binding or sticking.\nFrom powershift transmission testing, the transmission selector lever and hydraulic control valve moved throughout first and second gear positions without sticking or binding. \xa0A metal plate installed across the opening of the shifting guide for the transmission selector lever prevented 3rd gear from being selected in forward or reverse.\nThe blade control has four positions: \xa0float, lower, hold, and raise. \xa0The blade control was found in the float detent position. \xa0Since, distinct hand effort is required to push the control lever from hold to the detent float position; investigators determined the victim must have put the blade control in the float position before he exited the bulldozer.\n', 'Braking System Design': 'The service and parking brake systems consist of spring-applied, hydraulically- released, enclosed wet disc brakes in both track drives.\xa0 The service brake is activated by a foot pedal which varies the brake pressure to the wet disc brakes. \xa0The parking brake is activated by a hand control lever. \xa0The parking brake lever linkage has an overcenter spring.\xa0 This spring pulls the lever to apply or release the parking brake.\xa0 If the operator wants to fully apply the parking brake, he will move the lever down.\xa0 When the lever moves past the overcenter position, the overcenter spring will pull the lever the remaining distance to fully apply the parking brake.Conversely, if the operator wants to fully release the parking brake, he will move the lever up.\xa0 When the lever moves past the overcenter position, the overcenter spring will pull the lever the remaining distance to fully release the parking brake.The parking brake control lever is designed so that it partially obstructs the exit door of the bulldozer when the parking brake is in the released position. \xa0This serves as a visual reminder to the operator to remain in the cab of the bulldozer until the parking brake is fully engaged.\xa0 In the released position, the parking brake lever is parallel with the cab floor and approximately 15 ¾ inches above the cab floor and approximately 5 ¾ inches from the dash panel (see Appendix B, Picture 1).The foot pedal service brake and parking brake lever controls activate a common single linkage on the steering and brake valve. \xa0The same brakes are applied within the track drives regardless of which controls are used. \xa0They are automatically applied when the engine is shut down due to hydraulic release pressure to the brakes.', 'Service and Parking Brake Controls, and Performance Test': 'When the service brake foot pedal was tested, it functioned and moved throughout its range without sticking or binding.\xa0 Investigators determined, however, that the pedal linkage was out of adjustment based on the specifications of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).The parking brake lever was found in the released position after the accident. \xa0The parking brake lever and linkage were still functional but testing revealed problems with the operation of the lever:The parking brake had a “stay point” range where the lever was on the applied side of the parking brake linkage overcenter spring, but was not being pulled into the fully applied position by the overcenter spring.\xa0 The parking brake would be applied, but the lever would not be snapped completely into position.\nLow hand force was all that was needed to pull the parking brake lever through the “stay point” toward the released position.\xa0\nThe parking brake control lever would move towards the released position if the following sequence occurred:\xa0 The foot pedal was fully applied.\xa0 Next, the parking brake was applied.\xa0 Lastly, the foot brake was released. \xa0This movement was able to move the parking brake lever to the released position if the lever was not set past the “stay point” when applied. \xa0This sequence could be expected when the bulldozer is stopped by an operator on a steep grade (see Appendix B, Picture 2).\xa0 If an operator stops on a grade by pushing the foot pedal and then engages the parking brake lever to the “stay point,” the parking brake lever could release when he takes his foot off the foot pedal.\n', 'Manufacturer’s Parking Procedure': 'The victim was not trained on the manufacturer’s parking procedure in the operator’s manual.\xa0 The general parking procedure outlined in the operation and maintenance manual is as follows:Park on a level surface. \xa0If necessary to park on a grade, block the machine.\nApply the service brake to stop the machine.\nShift the transmission control to neutral.\nEngage the parking brake.\nLower all implements to the ground and apply slight down pressure.\nStop the engine.\nTurn the start switch to the OFF position.\nTurn the disconnect switch key to the OFF position and remove the key.\nIn this instance, the victim had not parked the bulldozer on a level surface.\xa0 He applied the service brake to stop the machine and he shifted into neutral.\xa0 He may or may not have engaged, or partially engaged the parking brake. \xa0The victim put the bulldozer blade in the float position but did not apply slight down pressure.\xa0 There were no rippers (long claw-like device on the back of the bulldozer) on the bulldozer.\xa0 The victim also did not stop the engine, turn the start switch to the OFF position, or turn the disconnect switch key to the OFF position.', 'Technical Support Findings': 'MSHA Technical Support determined that the problems with the operation of the parking brake assembly were due to an incorrect overcenter spring installed in the assembly.\xa0 This spring provided considerably less spring force than the OEM overcenter spring and made it easier for the parking brake lever to move to the released position. \xa0The lever force test demonstrated that replacing the incorrect overcenter spring raised the hand force requirements from approximately 1 pound of force to approximately 6 pounds of force. \xa0Photographs taken of the bulldozer, before it was purchased, and when it was transferred to the equipment dealer, indicate that the general condition of the parking brake lever linkage existed prior to the mine operator purchasing the bulldozer. \xa0The lack of a positive spring and linkage action to firmly hold the parking brake control lever in the applied position could have contributed to the accident had the victim engaged or attempted to engage the parking brake and it did not hold (see Appendix B, Pictures 3 and 4).', 'Ground Control Plan': 'The mine operator’s ground control plan was established by the mine operator and filed with MSHA on April 13, 2016, over a year before the Oak Hill P-47 operation became active and producing.\xa0 The Oak Hill P – 47 refuse bank area began operation on July 13, 2017, 12 days before the accident.\xa0 At the time of the accident, the mine operator had not developed another ground control plan which included provisions to address the hazards associated with mining on a refuse bank.The plan should have included the following provisions to insure safe mining conditions:Maintaining a substantial pile of refuse material at the end of a bulldozer push path to prevent the bulldozer from pushing over the edge of the push path. \xa0This pile of refuse material is created when the bulldozer pushing the material leaves one to two bulldozer blades of material at the end of the push.\nMaintaining the edge of the bulldozer push path at a reduced grade to prevent a condition where a bulldozer could travel over the edge of a push path.\n', 'Training and Experience': 'MSHA conducted a thorough review of Reading Anthracite Company’s training records.\xa0 The victim had seven years and nine months of total mining experience as an equipment operator.\xa0 He received his first eight hours of new miner training on November 9, 2015, and completed the required twenty four hours of training on November 12, 2015, at West Spring Energy LLC. \xa0Task training records verify that he received training on D10, D9R, and D9T bulldozers, 16G grader, 375 excavator, HM400 articulated truck, and various haul trucks. \xa0The last record of annual refresher training he received was at West Spring Energy LLC on February 2, 2017.On July 13, 2017, the victim started at Reading Anthracite Company’s New St. Nicholas Breaker (Oak Hill P - 47 Operation).\xa0 He received hazard training specific to the mine site and task training on the bulldozer on the same day he started working alone on the refuse bank clearing trees.Since the victim was a new employee but an experienced miner, the operator was required to give him experienced miner training.\xa0 While he received experienced miner training, it was inadequate.\xa0 The victim was not trained on the specific mining conditions or on the mine’s ground control plan, as specifically outlined in the operator’s training plan approved by MSHA on November 13, 2013.While the victim did receive task training on the bulldozer, the training was not conducted according to the operator’s approved training plan, which required using the bulldozer’s operator’s manual issued by the manufacturer.\xa0 This manual was not used when the victim was task trained because the mine operator did not have a copy. \xa0In addition, investigators learned that the parking procedures for parking on a grade were not discussed or performed during task training. \xa0Greg Sterling, Maintenance Superintendent, provided the victim with the task training on the bulldozer.\xa0 However, he did not review the CAT D9L operator’s manual with the victim and had never operated the machine.Non-contributory citations were issued for violations of 30 C.F.R. § 48.27(a)(1), 30 C.F.R. § 48.29(a), and 30 C.F.R. §\xa048.27(d) due to training deficiencies.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are root causes identified during the investigation and the operator’s implemented corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident:Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not provide adequate task training to the victim.\xa0 The operator’s approved training plan required training on the provisions in the bulldozer’s operating manual but the operator did not have a copy of the manual.\xa0 In addition, investigators learned that the parking procedures for parking on a grade were not discussed and performed during task training.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator adequately trained equipment operators on the safety aspects and safe operating procedures of their machines, according to the operating manuals and approved training plan.\xa0 The task training included supervised practice during nonproduction or supervised operation during production.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not develop a suitable ground control plan.\xa0 The ground control plan did not address the hazards associated with mining a refuse bank.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator has developed a ground control plan to address the hazards associated with mining on a refuse bank.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not provide adequate experienced miner training, as outlined in its approved training plan.\xa0 The training plan requires training on the ground control plan, which was inadequate at the time of the accident\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator trained all equipment operators on the provisions of the ground control plan that were added after the fatal accident.\xa0', 'CONCLUSION': '\xa0On Tuesday, July 25, 2017, a 28-year-old equipment operator with seven years and nine months of total mining experience was fatally injured while operating a Caterpillar D9L bulldozer on a refuse bank.\xa0 The accident occurred when the victim, who was working alone, was run over by the bulldozer.\xa0 Investigators believe that shortly before the accident he exited the bulldozer onto the slope of the refuse bank and into the bulldozer’s push path near the edge of the

Pierce, District Manager', 'OVERVIEW': 'Matthew W. Kantala IV, ledge man, age 36, was fatally injured on July 20, 2017, while performing secondary breakage operations on a block of granite.\xa0 A large piece of granite broke loose and knocked Kantala off a ledge to the mine floor approximately 10 feet below. The large piece of granite hit the ledge and broke into three pieces. One of the pieces, weighing an estimated six tons, fell on Kantala.The accident occurred because the mine operator: (1) did not block material during secondary breakage operations to prevent movement; (2) did not make sure miners were using fall protection; and (3) did not conduct an adequate workplace examination –by not identifying a prominent geological anomaly in the granite and not promptly initiating appropriate action to correct such condition.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'The Blue Sky Quarry #2 is a surface granite mining operation located in Carlton, Oglethorpe County, Georgia.\xa0 The mine operation’s manager is Randy Rice.\xa0 The mine operates five days per week with one eight-hour shift per day, and employs nine people.The granite is drilled and diamond sawed into large blocks and then sized using a drill/wedge procedure.\xa0 This procedure consists of drilling 3/4-inch holes approximately 12-16 inches apart in the rock face with a small jackhammer drill (plug drill), then driving 3/4-inch wedges that are 5 inches long into the holes.\xa0 A hammer is used to drive the wedges in until the rock fractures.\xa0 This creates a block about 5 feet tall by 5 feet deep and approximately 5-8 feet long.\xa0 The block of rock is then transported to an on-site saw shop and further sized for shipping, primarily to the northeastern part of the United States, for use as curbing material.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on May 2, 2017.', 'DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'Matthew W. Kantala IV, a ledge man at Blue Sky Quarry #2, reported to work on July 20, 2017, at his normal starting time of 6:00 a.m.\xa0 At approximately 6:15 a.m., Arturo Metorio, operator/foreman, instructed Kantala on which ledge to work. \xa0Metorio proceeded with operating a front-end loader in another area of the mine while Kantala proceeded to the working area where the accident occurred.Approximately 20 minutes later, Metorio saw Kantala going to the office area.\xa0 Kantala told Metorio he was going to retrieve the small plug drill.\xa0 Approximately 20 minutes after speaking with the victim, Metorio observed Kantala walking to another area of the mine and returning with a larger jackhammer. Metorio did not speak with Kantala at that point.\xa0 The larger jackhammer is primarily used to break the shale cap rock overlying the granite and is not typically used in the secondary breakage process.\xa0Approximately 20 minutes later, Metorio observed another miner, Gumercindo Hernandez, running toward him.\xa0 Hernandez told Metorio he heard a loud crack and a slide in the area Kantala was working and went to see what had happened.\xa0 Hernandez told Metorio that he saw Kantala lying on the mine floor with a large rock on top of him.Metorio went to the area at the northeast corner of the pit and saw Kantala lying on the mine floor under a large granite rock.\xa0 Metorio got the attention of Tracy Harris, drill operator, who is trained in first-aid, to come to the site.\xa0 Harris checked for a pulse and did not find one.\xa0 Harris stayed with Kantala until emergency medical services (EMS) arrived.\xa0 An employee called EMS at approximately 10:15 a.m., and emergency services arrived on site at approximately 10:28 a.m.\xa0 Workers recovered the victim’s body at approximately 1:35 p.m.\xa0 The cause of death was attributed to crushing injuries.\xa0', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'Randy Rice, Manager, called the Department of Labor’s National Contact Center (DOLNCC) at 10:53 a.m. on July 20, 2017.\xa0 The DOLNCC contacted Mike Evans, Safety Specialist, Southeastern District.\xa0 Upon arrival at the mine site, an investigator issued an order pursuant to Section 103(k) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977, as amended.MSHA’s accident investigation team conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, reviewed training documentation, and examined work procedures relevant to the accident.\xa0 Mine management assisted in the investigation.', 'DISCUSSION': 'WeatherWeather was not a factor.\xa0 The skies were clear with no rain, and there was a high temperature of approximately 95 degrees Fahrenheit on the day of the accident.\xa0Training and Work ExperienceThe victim was an experienced miner (ledge man) who performed this work at this mine for 1 year, 35 weeks.\xa0 He previously worked at other mining operations performing similar duties.\xa0 A representative of MSHA’s Educational Field and Small Mine Services conducted an in-depth review of the victim’s training records.\xa0 MSHA determined that training records were in compliance with training requirements.Elberton GraniteThis intrusion of granite is referred to as Elberton Granite in this geographical area. The Elberton Granite has an approximate size of 35 miles long and 6 miles wide.\xa0 The entire area is not solid granite, but there are individual deposits, or “bodies” of granite, within the area.\xa0 Granite is plentiful on the surface in the area around Blue Sky Quarry #2.Work Procedures\xa0Investigators determined that Kantala was on a ledge in front of the large piece of granite breaking it into smaller blocks.\xa0 He drilled a 1-1/4-inch diameter hole and used an 8-inch wedge to perform the secondary breakage instead of using the normal method for secondary breakage described above.AnomalyA prominent anomaly is present in the rock formation.\xa0 This anomaly is an interface between two bands of granite that likely formed at different times and/or cooled at different rates, and creates a plane of weakness within the granite.\xa0 The anomaly typically allows for breakage in the horizontal plane.\xa0 Mine management was aware of this anomaly, but did not identify it during workplace examinations so that corrective actions could be taken.A large section of granite sloughed off at the anomaly because it was not blocked to prevent movement which would endanger persons in the work area.\xa0 This section of granite was approximately 18-20 feet long and 5 feet thick. While standing on some stacked rock that had been placed on the work bench, the victim was driving wedges into a block of granite in an attempt to break it loose. A piece of granite weighing six tons fell and pushed the victim from the work bench onto the mine floor, approximately 10 feet below. \xa0The victim was wearing a fall protection harness, but it was not secured to an anchor and therefore was not protective.\xa0', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'Investigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified the following root causes:Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not block material to prevent movement during secondary breakage operations.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator purchased new equipment and trained miners in a newly developed plan with procedures for different methods of secondary breakage.\xa0 This plan addresses and requires the prevention of movement of material.\xa0Root Cause: The mine operator did not assure that miners used fall protection where there was a danger of falling.\nCorrective Action: The mine operator purchased new equipment and trained miners in a newly developed plan with procedures for different methods of secondary breakage.\xa0 This plan addresses and requires the use of fall protection.\xa0Root Cause: The mine operator did not conduct adequate workplace examinations.\nCorrective Action: The mine operator trained miners in a newly developed plan with procedures for different methods of secondary breakage.\xa0 This plan addresses workplace examinations and actions to be taken to address any hazardous conditions found.', 'CONCLUSION': 'Matthew W. Kantala IV was fatally injured while performing secondary breakage operations when a large section of granite rock fell, knocked him to the mine floor, and a portion of the granite fell on top of him.\xa0 The accident occurred because the mine operator did not: (1) block material during secondary breakage operations to prevent movement; (2) make sure miners were using fall protection; and (3) conduct adequate workplace examinations –the operator failed to identify a prominent geological anomaly in the granite and failed to take prompt, appropriate action to correct such condition.', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'Issued to Blue Sky Quarries Inc. (Mine Operator) Order No. 8905136 -- issued July 20, 2017, pursuant to Section 103(k) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977:A fatal accident occurred at this mining operation on July 20, 2017, when a miner was working on the SE corner of the East Quarry. A large block of dimensional stone [granite] came loose, slid toward the miner, forcing him off the ledge and fell on top of the miner at the bottom of the quarry. This order is issued to assure the safety of all persons at this operation. It prohibits all activity at the SE corner of the East Pit area until MSHA has determined that it is safe to resume normal operations in the area. The mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an authorized representative for all actions to recover and /or restore operations to the affected area. Citation No. 8910427 -- issued pursuant to Section 104(d)(1) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 for a violation of 30 CFR § 56.3400:Did not block material to be broken, from movement, during the secondary breakage operation of mining, at this operation contributed to a fatal accident at this mine on July 20, 2017, at approximately 11:20 a.m., when a miner (ledge man) was crushed beneath a large section of a rock face after it had fallen. While standing on some stacked rock that had been placed on the work bench, a miner was driving wedges into a block of granite in an attempt to break it loose. A piece of granite weighing 6 tons fell and pushed the miner from the work bench onto the mine floor, approximately 10 feet below him. This piece of granite then fell on the miner and crushed him, which resulted in fatal injuries.\xa0 Management engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence by failing to block material or insure that persons performing this type of task would not be exposed to danger, before performing secondary breakage operations taking place. This violation is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory standard.Citation No. 8910428 -- issued pursuant to Section 104(a) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 for a violation of 30 CFR § 56.15005:A miner who was fatally injured at this mine on July 20, 2017, at approximately 11:20 a.m., was not using fall protection. The miner was wearing a safety harness, however, the harness was not attached to an anchor.

Creasy, Acting District Manager', 'OVERVIEW': 'On Monday, June 19, 2017, at approximately 6:27 p.m. CDT, Marius Shepherd, a 32-year-old mine examiner with 8 years and 9 months of experience, received fatal injuries when he was thrown or jumped from the passenger seat of a runaway supply train.\xa0 The supply train, consisting of a lead locomotive, three supply cars, a ballast car and a trailing locomotive, was traveling on a descending grade when the operators lost control.\xa0 Neither of the locomotive operators saw the victim’s exit from the locomotive, and investigators were unable to determine whether he was thrown or jumped.\xa0 After the victim exited, the train continued moving for 175 feet and derailed.The fatal accident occurred, in part, because the mine operator did not comply with previously issued safeguards.\xa0 These safeguards prohibited unauthorized personnel from riding in locomotives, water over track rails, and required sanding devices to be properly maintained. \xa0Water had accumulated over the track rails, and the track sanding devices for the locomotives were not maintained and functional.\xa0 The locomotive operators were not able to control the speed of the supply train due to the combination of the track grade, the non-functioning locomotive track sanders, and the slick, wet rails.', '\xa0 GENERAL INFORMATION': 'The Oak Grove Mine is located in the Oak Grove community near Hueytown, Alabama.\xa0 Oak Grove Resources, LLC operates the underground shaft mine, which extracts coal from the Blue Creek coal seam.\xa0 The mine has three production shifts, operating six days per week.\xa0 The mine utilizes diesel-engine rail haulage equipment to move miners, supplies, and mining equipment throughout the active areas of the mine.\xa0 Average coal production is 9,500 tons per day.\xa0 The mine liberates over four million cubic feet of methane gas in a 24-hour period and is on a 5-day spot inspection schedule in accordance with Section 103(i) of the Mine Act.\xa0 The hourly workers are represented by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA).The principal officers for the mine at the time of the accident were:Larry Millburg...................................... General ManagerJ.D. Morris.................................................. Mine ManagerKeith Miller................................ General Mine ForemanChad McAtee........................................... Safety ManagerA regular (E01) safety and health inspection began on April 4, 2017 and was ongoing at the time of the accident. \xa0The previous E01 inspection was completed on March 30, 2017. \xa0On October 1, 2017, Coal District 11 in Birmingham, Alabama was merged with Coal District 7 in Barbourville, Kentucky, and the investigation was completed under the jurisdiction of District 7.\xa0 The Non-Fatal Days Lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for the mine in 2016 was 4.22 as compared to a national NFDL rate of 3.32 for mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On Monday, June 19, 2017, Shepherd started his shift at 3:00 p.m. as part of the evening crew.\xa0 After a safety meeting, Willie Edwards, Evening Shift Foreman, gave out work assignments. \xa0At about 3:08 p.m., Locomotive Operators Darrell Silas and Derrick Allen entered the mine and traveled to the No. 6 locomotive and the No. 12 locomotive. \xa0After they conducted a pre-operational check, Silas and Allen drove the locomotives to the bottom of the service shaft and coupled four rail cars already loaded with supplies.\xa0The No. 6 locomotive, operated by Allen, was in the lead, followed by the four supply cars and the No. 12 trailing locomotive, operated by Silas.\xa0 At about 3:45 p.m., Shepherd entered the mine via the service hoist and met Allen and Silas at the bottom of the service shaft.\xa0 Shepherd asked if he could ride as a passenger in one of the locomotives to the Main North 4 track, where he intended to begin his examination route along the belt entry.\xa0 Investigators learned from interviews that it was common practice for examiners to ride with a locomotive crew or other vehicles traveling in and/or out of the mine on the track.At approximately 5:40 p.m., the train with Shepherd aboard departed on the Main North 3 track and headed inby. \xa0Shepherd was riding in the passenger seat of the No. 12 trailing locomotive with Silas.\xa0 The motor crew delivered the first flat car, containing oil and shearer bits, to the 17 East section.\xa0 Leaving 17 East, the train stopped at the track switch at the mouth of the section (crosscut No. 44).\xa0 Shepherd disembarked from the trailing locomotive in order to throw the track switch.\xa0 He then changed his location on the train, boarding the lead locomotive and sat in the passenger seat.\xa0 The train left the switch location and continued inby on the Main North 3 track.At approximately 6:25 p.m., the train reached the top of the grade on the Main North 3 track and turned east onto the East Main track, which has a descending grade in the direction of travel. \xa0At crosscut No. 2, Allen signaled Silas to shift from first to second gear, and he did so.\xa0 The No. 6 lead locomotive has 4 transmission speeds and the No. 12 trailing locomotive has 3 transmission speeds.\xa0 When Silas felt the lead locomotive pulling him, he shifted into third gear.At crosscut No. 5, Silas decided that the train had gained too much speed, and he shifted back to second gear. \xa0He locked his track sanders into the ‘continuous open’ position, which should have deposited sand onto the tracks and slowed the train.\xa0 About the same time, Allen noticed the track was wet and slick. \xa0He too began applying sand to the track using his sanders.Near crosscut No. 8, Allen felt his locomotive lose all traction. \xa0He continued working his sanders and down-shifted the locomotive, but the train was soon out of control. \xa0The train continued for 1,225 feet and, at about crosscut No. 16, Shepherd was either thrown or jumped from the No. 6 locomotive. \xa0Allen and Silas did not witness Shepherd leaving the locomotive.Traveling at an excessive speed, the train continued about 175 feet to the curve at crosscut No. 17, where the East Main track turns into the Main North 4 track, and it derailed. \xa0The lead locomotive came to rest completely off the track and in a crosscut.\xa0 The ballast car and the No. 12 trailing locomotive remained on the track (see Appendix B).\xa0Daniel Nantz, General Inside Laborer, was working at the East Main belt tailpiece.\xa0 He heard the train wreck and went to investigate.\xa0 Nantz spotted Allen in the deck of the lead locomotive and asked if he was okay. \xa0Allen responded he was fine and requested Nantz to check on Silas and Shepherd. \xa0Nantz found Silas sitting in the deck of his locomotive, shaken but uninjured. \xa0Silas asked Nantz if he knew where Shepherd was located.\xa0 He answered, “No.” \xa0After a quick search, Nantz\xa0found Shepherd in crosscut No. 16 next to an electrical distribution box.\xa0 He was unconscious and lying on his back, with his feet pointing toward the track.Nantz elevated Shepherd’s head and gave support to stabilize his neck.\xa0 Allen arrived at the scene and used his hand-held radio to call for help.\xa0 He contacted Edwards to inform him of the accident.\xa0 At approximately 6:30 p.m. Edwards contacted Greg Cox, Communication System Operator, who was on the surface.\xa0 He told Cox that Shepherd had a head injury and needed an ambulance or possibly a medical helicopter.Gary Jenkins, Evening Shift Assistant Mine Foreman, heard the call for help over the radio. \xa0Jenkins and his crew were in close proximity to the accident scene, so he notified Edwards they would travel to the location to assist. \xa0According to mine tracking system records, Jenkins and his crew, consisting of Brad Kelley, General Inside Laborer, David Barnett, Belt Repairman, and Stephen Poe, Belt Repairman, arrived at Shepherd’s location at 6:33 p.m. \xa0They observed that Shepherd’s condition was serious.\xa0 Jenkins radioed Edwards to get an ambulance and hold the hoist at the bottom of the service shaft.At 6:37 p.m., Jenkins and his crew placed Shepherd on a track-mounted bus and began traveling toward the shaft bottom.\xa0 Shepherd remained unconscious.\xa0 They placed Shepherd in a Stokes basket, carried him to the hoist, and arrived on the surface at 7:13 p.m.Shepherd was loaded into an ambulance operated by Concord Fire and Rescue and transported to the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital.\xa0 He was pronounced dead by Dr. Andrew Papoy, M.D., at 8:50 p.m.', 'INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT': 'At the time of the accident, Keith Chaney, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, had completed his inspection activities for the day and was at the surface preparing to leave the mine property.\xa0 He was notified of the accident at approximately 6:40 p.m., and at 7:30 p.m., he issued a 103(k) order to preserve the accident scene and prevent the destruction of any evidence that would assist in the investigation.\xa0 Cox called the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center at 6:57 p.m. to report the accident.\xa0 The Contact Center contacted Russel Weekly, Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector. \xa0Weekly called Danny Crumpton, Assistant District Manager (Enforcement), and notified him of the accident. \xa0Crumpton assigned Philip Ingram and Darryl Allen, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspectors, and Weekly to investigate the accident.\xa0 Ingram, Darryl Allen, and Weekly traveled to the mine site and were briefed by Chaney on the circumstances of the accident.The investigators conducted preliminary interviews at the North Portal mine office with persons having knowledge of the accident. \xa0At the accident site, they conducted a survey of the equipment and structures involved and took photographs.\xa0 In addition to the MSHA investigation team, the State of Alabama Department of Industrial Relations Mining and Reclamation Division, the UMWA, and mine management personnel participated in the investigation (see Appendix A). \xa0On June 21 and 22, 2017, MSHA investigators made additional visits to the accident scene to gather evidence.MSHA and the State of Alabama conducted formal interviews on June 21, 27 and 28, 2017, at the Oak Grove mine office (see Appendix A).', 'DISCUSSION': 'Mine TrackInvestigators inspected the mine track rails on the East Main track following the accident. \xa0The rails were wet from condensation.\xa0 They found an accumulation of water, which was approximately ½ to 1 inch over the ball of the track rail at crosscut No. 8 for a span of 10 feet. \xa0At the derailment location, the track’s left and right rails under the inby end of the (4) ballast car had shifted 4 inches and 3 inches, respectively.\xa0 Investigators concluded that the damage to the rails occurred during the derailment.Oak Grove Resources, LLC conducted a vertical profile survey of the East Main track grade.\xa0 It found the grade averaged approximately 2.8% along the track where the operators noted problems in controlling the speed of the train.\xa0 The steepest length of the track is on a 6.74% grade for a distance of approximately 80 feet.\xa0 The flattest area along the track has a grade of 0.56% (see Appendix B).Diesel Locomotives and Supply CarsThe front No. 6 locomotive was a Brookville Model BDC-20UP, serial number 7929, 20 ton, manufactured in 1996.\xa0 The operator and passenger seat were inspected and no deficiencies were observed (see Appendix C).\xa0 A seatbelt or other restraint was not required and was not installed in the locomotive.\xa0 The weight is listed as 40,575 pounds and it is 19 feet long and 7 feet wide.The weights and dimensions of the supply cars were as follows:(1) Flat car with two pallets of oil and shearer bits was dropped off on 18 East Section and was not involved in the accident; therefore the weight of that car was not measured.(2) Flat car, loaded with two pallets of oil, monorail hangers, and belt clips, weighed 12,378 pounds and was 16 feet long and 7 feet wide.(3) Flat car, loaded with six pallets of solid cinder blocks, two doors, one pallet of block sealant and one pallet of roof bolt resin, weighed 29,304 pounds and was 16 feet long and 7 feet wide.(4) Ballast gravel car, loaded, weighed 32,667 pounds and was 18 feet long and 7 feet wide.\xa0The No. 12 trailing locomotive was an Irwin Model DH25, serial number 08407, 25 ton. \xa0It had been rebuilt.\xa0 The rebuild included installing different axles and service and parking brake systems.\xa0 The operator and passenger seats were inspected and no deficiencies were observed.\xa0 The rebuilt model weighed about 56,000 pounds and was 23 feet 8 inches long and 7 feet 8 inches wide. \xa0The total weight of the locomotives, the two loaded flat cars and the ballast gravel car was 170,924 pounds (85.46 tons).\xa0 The total length of the train, including the couplers was 99 feet long.Train CouplersThe investigators inspected the couplers to determine if any critical dimensions were out-of-tolerance.\xa0 While the coupler that connected the No. 12 trailing locomotive and the ballast gravel car was out-of-tolerance due to an inadequate lock thickness, it was still coupled after the accident.\xa0 As a result, investigators concluded that its condition did not contribute to this accident.\xa0 All of the other train couplers were within the tolerance range.\xa0 MSHA issued a non-contributory citation to the operator for violation of 30 CFR § 75.1725(a) because the train coupler’s lock thickness was out-of-tolerance range.GearingInvestigators found the transmission gear selection lever in the No. 6 lead locomotive in the neutral position. \xa0Because the lead locomotive derailed, the position of the gear lever could have been changed by the impact force resulting from the accident.\xa0 The transmission gear selection lever in the No. 12 trailing locomotive was found in 2nd gear.Silas stated that the gearing of the No. 6 and No. 12 locomotives was different.\xa0 The No. 12 locomotive typically had to be in one gear higher than the No. 6 locomotive to best keep the speed of the locomotives the same.\xa0 For example, the No. 12 locomotive would have to be in 3rd gear, and the No. 6 locomotive would have to be in 2nd gear for the locomotives to best travel at the same speed. \xa0Although the different gearing would not have been enough to cause the train to derail, it would have complicated the process for the operators to uniformly control the speed of the train.BrakesBoth locomotives are provided with service and parking brakes, but the two supply flatcars and ballast car are not equipped with braking systems.\xa0 Using Brookville’s operation and service manual, investigators tested the No. 6 locomotive, which was in front.\xa0 They found that the braking systems did not work to stop the locomotive and were defective.\xa0 However, because the operators did not use the service and parking brake systems to control the speed of the train, their condition did not contribute to the accident.\xa0 MSHA issued a non-contributory citation for the defective service and parking brakes, a violation of 30 CFR § 75.1909(b)(7).Investigators also tested the brake systems on the No. 12 trailing locomotive and found they held the machine stationary.\xa0 However, the rebuild of the locomotive had significantly changed the design of the service and parking brake systems so that a single failure of one service brake valve and air chamber would cause the loss of all service braking capability.\xa0 Because this design did not meet the requirements of 30 CFR§75.1909(b)(6), MSHA issued the operator a non-contributory citation.Locomotive Track SandersEach locomotive is equipped with four sand reservoirs to deposit sand on the rails.\xa0 Two are located on the front, one on each side and two on the rear (see Appendix D). \xa0Track sanders are designed to apply sand to the rails only in the direction of travel.\xa0 These sanders are referred to as the ‘front’ sanders.\xa0 For both the lead No. 6 locomotive, and the rear No. 12 locomotive investigators found that the left front sanders were inoperative due to blockages in the reservoirs.\xa0 MSHA could not determine when these sanders became inoperative.The two right front sanders on each locomotive were working as required.\xa0 With only two of the front four sanders functioning as intended, there was insufficient frictional force between the locomotive’s wheels and the track rails to help slow the speed of the supply train.Pre-Operational Examination and MaintenanceSilas and Allen stated they conducted the pre-operational check of both locomotives prior to use, and one sander on the No. 12 locomotive was found inoperative.\xa0 The sander was repaired and they did not detect any other issues with either locomotive.\xa0 Investigators reviewed the maintenance records for the two locomotives.\xa0 The maintenance records indicated that all hazards listed had been corrected.CommunicationThe main method of communication between locomotive operators\xa0was a portable radio system.\xa0 However, it did not provide a clear means of communication.\xa0 When the train was in motion, the noise level of the running locomotives and other noises from the mine environment prevented audible broadcasts through the radio system.\xa0 As a result, the operators were not able to share important information that would have assisted them in maintaining a safe speed on wet rails on a descending track grade.\xa0 This includes better coordination to address the challenges presented by different gear ratios to control the supply train’s speed. In addition, the mine did not have standardized visual or audible signaling systems in place that would have alerted the operators to observe track conditions and maintain a safe speed.Previously Issued SafeguardsIn 1986 and 1987, MSHA issued three safeguards to the mine operator:Safeguard 2812277, issued on August 5, 1986, states, in part:\xa0 “. . . No person, other than the motorman and brakeman should ride on a locomotive unless authorized by the mine foreman, and then only when safe riding facilities are provided. . . .”Safeguard 2811430, issued on November 20, 1986, states, in part: “. . . all track mounted personnel carriers shall be provided with a well maintained fully operational sanding device.”\xa0 After this safeguard was issued, MSHA wrote over 200 citations because the mine operator violated the safety criteria in this safeguard.Safeguard 2809080, issued on August 10, 1987, states in part: “. . . Water shall not accumulate over the rails in track haulage entry where track mounted personnel carriers and locomotives are required to travel.” \xa0After this safeguard was issued, MSHA wrote over 100 citations because the mine operator violated the safety criteria in this safeguard.The operator disregarded these safeguards, and they were not reflected in any of its policies and procedures.\xa0 The victim was not authorized to ride on any locomotive, the sanding device was not well maintained or fully operational, and at the time of the accident, water had accumulated over the rails.TrainingShepherd began working at this mine September 26, 2016, as a preshift examiner.\xa0 Shepherd received experienced miner training and locomotive operations’ task training on September 27, 2016.\xa0 No training deficiencies were found during the investigation.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the investigation and the operator’s implemented corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence of this type of accident.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator’s policies and procedures did not ensure compliance with two previously issued safeguards.\xa0 One safeguard requires that no person other than a motorman and brakeman ride in a locomotive without the mine foreman’s authorization.\xa0 The victim was riding in the locomotive without authorization from a mine foreman.\xa0 The other safeguard requires that all track mounted personnel carriers be provided with a well maintained, fully operational sanding device.\xa0 The two locomotives, involved in the accident, each have four sanders (total of eight).\xa0 The left front sander on each locomotive was not fully operational.\xa0 Non-functioning locomotive sanders contributed to the inability of the locomotive operators to control the speed of the supply train.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator implemented a new policy/procedure requiring locomotive operators to conduct a thorough pre-operational check, make a written record of the checks, and correct noted deficiencies before any locomotive is put into operation. \xa0Miners were trained on the new policy/procedure, as well as on the two safeguards, and the operator kept a roster of attendees.\xa0 MSHA personnel monitored the training. \xa0Additionally, MSHA issued a new safeguard limiting the reasons why a passenger may ride on a locomotive.\xa0 The new safeguard also requires additional training for those passengers.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator’s policies and procedures did not ensure compliance with a previously issued safeguard (2809080) and the operator did not have an effective procedure in place to ensure that supply trains could operate safely in the section of the track where the fatality occurred.\xa0 The safeguard requires that water shall not accumulate over the rails in track haulage entries where track mounted personnel carriers and locomotives are required to travel.\xa0 Wet track rails and other factors contributed to the inability of the locomotive operators to maintain the supply train at a safe speed.\xa0 These factors included:\xa0 a descending track grade; the differences in the locomotives’ gear ratios; locomotive track sanders not being fully operational; and the lack of standardized uniform communication between locomotive operators.\xa0 All of these played a role in the train going out of control, which contributed to the mine examiner’s accident and fatal injuries.\xa0\nCorrective Action: \xa0The mine operator implemented several written provisions/policies as corrective actions. \xa0Daily reporting of track conditions by preshift examiners will be communicated to locomotive operators.\xa0 Water over the track will be corrected prior to track mounted personnel carriers and locomotives traveling in those hazards areas.\xa0 The track conditions, hazards noted, and their corrective actions will be recorded in the pre-shift reports.\xa0 Signs were placed along mine track grades to alert locomotive operators to observe track conditions and maintain a safe speed.\xa0 A risk assessment system was developed to determine the total safe train weight for specific mine grades and rail conditions.\xa0 A leading and trailing locomotive system will be used at all times and the gear ratio between the two locomotives will be compatible.\xa0 An effective standardized communication system between locomotive operators of supply trains was developed, and training on these new policies and procedures was conducted, and a roster kept by the operator.\xa0 This training was monitored by MSHA personnel.\xa0', 'CONCLUSION': 'On Monday, June 19, 2017, at approximately 6:27 p.m. CDT, a 32-year-old mine examiner with 8 years and 9 months of experience received fatal injuries when he was thrown or jumped from the passenger seat of a runaway locomotive supply train.\xa0 The supply train, consisting of a lead locomotive, three supply cars, and a trailing locomotive, was traveling on a descending grade when the operators lost control of it.\xa0 There were no witnesses to the victim’s exit from the locomotive, and investigators were unable to determine whether he was thrown or jumped.\xa0 After the victim exited, the train continued for about 175 feet and derailed.\xa0 The victim was not authorized to ride as a passenger on any locomotive at the time of the accident.The fatal accident occurred because the mine operator did not comply with previously issued safeguards that prohibited unauthorized personnel from riding in the locomotives.\xa0 The operator also allowed other hazardous conditions to exist.\xa0 Water had accumulated over the track rails, and the track sanding devices for the locomotives were not maintained and functional.\xa0 The locomotive operators were not able to control the speed of the supply train due to the combination of the track grade, the non-functioning locomotive track sanders, and the wet (slick) rails.\xa0___________________________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 _________________Samuel R.

DateActing District Manager'}","on monday, june 19, 2017, shepherd started his shift at 3:00 p.m. as part of the evening crew.  after a safety meeting, willie edwards, evening shift foreman, gave out work assignments.  at about 3:08 p.m., locomotive operators darrell silas and derrick allen entered the mine and traveled to the no. 6 locomotive and the no. 12 locomotive.  after they conducted a pre-operational check, silas and allen drove the locomotives to the bottom of the service shaft and coupled four rail cars already loaded with supplies. the no. 6 locomotive, operated by allen, was in the lead, followed by the four supply cars and the no. 12 trailing locomotive, operated by silas.  at about 3:45 p.m., shepherd entered the mine via the service hoist and met allen and silas at the bottom of the service shaft.  shepherd asked if he could ride as a passenger in one of the locomotives to the main north 4 track, where he intended to begin his examination route along the belt entry.  investigators learned from interviews that it was common practice for examiners to ride with a locomotive crew or other vehicles traveling in and/or out of the mine on the track.at approximately 5:40 p.m., the train with shepherd aboard departed on the main north 3 track and headed inby.  shepherd was riding in the passenger seat of the no. 12 trailing locomotive with silas.  the motor crew delivered the first flat car, containing oil and shearer bits, to the 17 east section.  leaving 17 east, the train stopped at the track switch at the mouth of the section (crosscut no. 44).  shepherd disembarked from the trailing locomotive in order to throw the track switch.  he then changed his location on the train, boarding the lead locomotive and sat in the passenger seat.  the train left the switch location and continued inby on the main north 3 track.at approximately 6:25 p.m., the train reached the top of the grade on the main north 3 track and turned east onto the east main track, which has a descending grade in the direction of travel.  at crosscut no. 2, allen signaled silas to shift from first to second gear, and he did so.  the no. 6 lead locomotive has 4 transmission speeds and the no. 12 trailing locomotive has 3 transmission speeds.  when silas felt the lead locomotive pulling him, he shifted into third gear.at crosscut no. 5, silas decided that the train had gained too much speed, and he shifted back to second gear.  he locked his track sanders into the ‘continuous open’ position, which should have deposited sand onto the tracks and slowed the train.  about the same time, allen noticed the track was wet and slick.  he too began applying sand to the track using his sanders.near crosscut no. 8, allen felt his locomotive lose all traction.  he continued working his sanders and down-shifted the locomotive, but the train was soon out of control.  the train continued for 1,225 feet and, at about crosscut no. 16, shepherd was either thrown or jumped from the no. 6 locomotive.  allen and silas did not witness shepherd leaving the locomotive.traveling at an excessive speed, the train continued about 175 feet to the curve at crosscut no. 17, where the east main track turns into the main north 4 track, and it derailed.  the lead locomotive came to rest completely off the track and in a crosscut.  the ballast car and the no. 12 trailing locomotive remained on the track (see appendix b). daniel nantz, general inside laborer, was working at the east main belt tailpiece.  he heard the train wreck and went to investigate.  nantz spotted allen in the deck of the lead locomotive and asked if he was okay.  allen responded he was fine and requested nantz to check on silas and shepherd.  nantz found silas sitting in the deck of his locomotive, shaken but uninjured.  silas asked nantz if he knew where shepherd was located.  he answered, “no.”  after a quick search, nantz found shepherd in crosscut no. 16 next to an electrical distribution box.  he was unconscious and lying on his back, with his feet pointing toward the track.nantz elevated shepherd’s head and gave support to stabilize his neck.  allen arrived at the scene and used his hand-held radio to call for help.  he contacted edwards to inform him of the accident.  at approximately 6:30 p.m. edwards contacted greg cox, communication system operator, who was on the surface.  he told cox that shepherd had a head injury and needed an ambulance or possibly a medical helicopter.gary jenkins, evening shift assistant mine foreman, heard the call for help over the radio.  jenkins and his crew were in close proximity to the accident scene, so he notified edwards they would travel to the location to assist.  according to mine tracking system records, jenkins and his crew, consisting of brad kelley, general inside laborer, david barnett, belt repairman, and stephen poe, belt repairman, arrived at shepherd’s location at 6:33 p.m.  they observed that shepherd’s condition was serious.  jenkins radioed edwards to get an ambulance and hold the hoist at the bottom of the service shaft.at 6:37 p.m., jenkins and his crew placed shepherd on a track-mounted bus and began traveling toward the shaft bottom.  shepherd remained unconscious.  they placed shepherd in a stokes basket, carried him to the hoist, and arrived on the surface at 7:13 p.m.shepherd was loaded into an ambulance operated by concord fire and rescue and transported to the university of alabama at birmingham hospital.  he was pronounced dead by dr. andrew papoy, m.d., at 8:50 p.m."

Dotson, District Manager', 'OVERVIEW': 'On June 13, 2017, at 8:43 p.m., Rodney S. Osborne, a 32-year-old continuous mining machine (CMM) operator, was fatally injured when he was pinned between the cutter head of a remote controlled CMM and a coal rib.\xa0 The victim was in a hazardous area or Red Zone repositioning the machine when the accident occurred.\xa0 The CMM was equipped with a proximity detection system (PDS), but it was manually overridden by an emergency stop override (ESO). \xa0As a result, the PDS did not warn the miner and the machine did not shut down when the miner entered the hazardous area.The accident occurred because the mine operator did not enforce the provisions in its approved roof control plan to prevent miners from working or traveling in hazardous areas while moving the CMM from place to place or repositioning between cuts.\xa0 Also, the mine operator did not provide administrative controls and acceptable work practices to prevent the PDS from being overridden during normal mining operations. In addition, the PDS on this CMM had been set up in a manner that deactivated the visual or audible warnings when the ESO function overrode the PDS.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'The Gateway Eagle Mine is an underground mine operated by Rockwell Mining, LLC, a subsidiary of Blackhawk Mining, LLC.\xa0 The mine is located in Wharton, Boone County, West Virginia.\xa0 At the time of the accident, the mine employed 112 miners, with 109 working underground.\xa0 The mine operates in the Eagle coal seam (bituminous) with an average mining height of 84 inches.\xa0 Laboratory analysis of air samples indicated no methane liberation in a 24-hour period.\xa0 The mine operates four mechanized mining units (MMUs) on two separate working sections utilizing the room and pillar method of mining.\xa0 Coal is mined with two CMMs on each working section and transported from the working faces to the section loading points by shuttle cars.\xa0 From there, a belt conveyor system moves the coal to the surface.\xa0 Diesel-powered rubber-tired personnel carriers are used to transport miners and materials into and out of the mine.The principal officers for the mine at the time of the accident were:Rex Osborne……………….General Mine Manager\nLuke Stepp…………………Superintendent\nSteve Gibson……………….Mine Foreman\nJustin Ray…………………..Safety RepresentativeA regular (E01) safety and health inspection was started on April 3, 2017, and had not been completed when the accident occurred. \xa0The previous regular inspection was completed on March 23, 2017.\xa0 The non-fatal days lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for the mine in 2016 was 12.16, compared to the national NFDL rate of 3.41 for mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On June 13, 2017, Rodney S. Osborne arrived at the mine at approximately 11:00 a.m., four hours prior to his regular shift. \xa0He was assigned to clean lifeline reflectors in the secondary escapeway from the No. 6 belt head to the No. 7 belt head.\xa0 The electronic tracking system shows that R. S. Osborne returned to the surface and met his regular production crew at 2:36 p.m.\xa0 At 3:01 p.m., the crew began traveling to the 010-0/011-0 MMU No. 1 working section.They arrived on the section at 3:36 p.m. and were met by Christopher Adkins, Section Foreman, who conducted a safety talk before instructing the crew to conduct pre-operational checks on their equipment.\xa0 Adkins conducted an on-shift examination of the working places and assigned R. S. Osborne to the left side cut cycle for the day. \xa0R. S. Osborne began the mining cycle operating the Company No. 254 CMM in the Upper 2 Left room. He then mined coal in the Lower 2 Left room and in the No. 3 entry (see Appendix B).Shortly before the accident, R. S. Osborne loaded the last coal of the cut in the No. 3 entry into the shuttle car operated by Densil Blankenship, Shuttle Car Operator.\xa0 Before delivering the coal to the belt feeder, Blankenship decided to assist R. S. Osborne in moving the CMM to the next cut.\xa0 He trammed the shuttle car two crosscuts outby, got out of the shuttle car and started walking toward the CMM when he saw R. S. Osborne on the inby end.\xa0 He called out to R. S. Osborne but received no response. \xa0As he got closer, he saw that R. S. Osborne was pinned between the coal rib and the right side cutter head of the CMM.Blankenship ran to the No. 2 entry and informed Steven Elswick and Jerrad Terrall, Roof Bolters, of the accident.\xa0 Elswick immediately traveled to R. S. Osborne and checked for a pulse.\xa0 He did not detect any vital signs.\xa0 Before going to the accident scene, Terrall used the mine phone to call outside and request medical assistance.\xa0 Daniel Moore, Roof Bolter, who was at the No. 4 entry, heard someone yelling for help and went to the scene.Blankenship then traveled outby one crosscut and informed Adkins of the accident.\xa0 Adkins proceeded to the accident scene, where Elswick asked him to locate David Havey, CMM Operator (right side), who was in the No. 4 entry.\xa0 When Havey arrived, he took the remote control transmitter from R. S. Osborne and moved the CMM to the left to free R. S. Osborne.\xa0 Elswick, Terrall, and Moore supported R. S. Osborne and lowered him onto a backboard that had been delivered, along with first aid supplies, by Mark Stepp, Right Side Shuttle Car Operator.\xa0 The miners detected no vital signs and the victim’s injuries were extensive.\xa0 They placed him on a diesel mantrip, which transported him to the surface at approximately 9:22 p.m.At 8:47 p.m., James Lovejoy, Mine Dispatcher, called 911 to report the accident. \xa0The Boone County Ambulance Authority (BCAA) paramedics arrived at the mine at 9:15 p.m., and received R. S. Osborne when he arrived at the surface.\xa0 After observing R. S. Osborne’s condition, the paramedics contacted Medbase and at 9:47 p.m. were instructed by Dr. Marie Nowak, the physician on duty, to declare R. S. Osborne dead.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On June 13, 2017, at 8:51 p.m. Frank Javins, Evening Shift Mine Foreman, notified the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center of the accident.\xa0 At 9:00 p.m., the DOL Contact Center notified Joey Presley, Staff Assistant, MSHA Coal District 4.\xa0 Presley then contacted Tracy Calloway, Staff Assistant, MSHA Coal District 12, because the mine was under the jurisdiction of District 12.Calloway immediately notified the following MSHA Coal District 12 personnel:Brian Dotson, District Manager\nLarry E. Bailey, Assistant District Manager (Technical)\nNicholas Christian, Pineville Field Office Supervisor\nMark Muncy, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Accident Investigator, and\nRex Hampton, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Electrical Specialist.\nAt 10:25 p.m., Muncy and Christian arrived at the mine site, and Muncy issued a 103(k) order to Rex Osborne, General Mine Manager, to preserve the accident scene and to prevent the destruction of any evidence that would assist in determining the cause of the accident.\xa0 Muncy and Christian reviewed mine records and conducted informal interviews with miners.\xa0 They obtained written statements from some miners. Hampton and Bailey arrived at approximately 10:45 p.m.\xa0 Hampton assisted in conducting initial interviews. \xa0Officials from the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST) and company officials participated in the investigation (see Appendix A).Bailey, Christian, Muncy, and Hampton, along with representatives of WVOMHST, the mine operator, and representatives of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) traveled underground to investigate the accident scene.\xa0 Muncy, Hampton, and Christian took photographs, and Muncy and Hampton took measurements to compose a sketch of the scene (see Appendix B).\xa0 Muncy asked Rex Osborne to contact CMM manufacturer Joy Global, Inc. and PDS manufacturer Matrix Design Group to have them download recorded data from the PDS installed on the No. 254 CMM.On June 14, 2017, Jonathan Cline, MSHA Roof Control Specialist/Civil Engineer, tested the PDSs on CMMs not involved in the accident.\xa0 He performed static and dynamic testing of the PDS on the No. 262 CMM and the No. 253 CMM at different locations underground.\xa0 Cline was unable to perform testing on the No. 252 CMM due to a maintenance issue. The PDS on the No. 253 and 262 CMMs operated correctly when tested.On June 15, 2017, representatives from Joy Global, Inc. and Matrix Design Group recovered the data from the PDS for all the CMMs. \xa0Following further refinement, the recovered data for the No. 254 CMM was turned over to MSHA by the mine operator on June 23, 2017.Matt Wharry and Patrick Retzer, MSHA Technical Support Engineers, conducted static and dynamic testing of the No. 254 CMM on June 15, 2017.\xa0 Muncy, Hampton, Dotson, and Calloway, along with representatives from the WVOMHST, the company and UMWA, observed the testing.MSHA and WVOMHST conducted formal interviews of miners on June 19, 2017, at the MSHA Coal District 4 Madison Field Office in Uneeda, WV, and on June 30, 2017 at the MSHA Coal District 12 Office in Pineville, WV.\xa0On June 21, 2017, Bruce Linville, Educational Field and Small Mine Services (EFSMS) reviewed the mine operator’s training records at the mine.\xa0 As a result, MSHA issued two noncontributory citations for inadequate record keeping for violating 30 CFR 48.3(c)(3) and 48.9(a).', 'DISCUSSION': 'Accident SceneThe accident occurred on the left side (010-0 MMU) of the 010-0/011-0 MMU No.1 working section, in the No. 3 Entry, approximately 12.5 feet inby the last open crosscut, along the right rib.\xa0 Entries Nos. 1, 2, and 3, and the associated crosscuts and rooms, made up MMU 010-0.\xa0 All other entries and crosscuts were a part of MMU 011-0.\xa0 The mine floor in the area was wet with a small ledge on the left side of the entry, which was not a factor in the accident.\xa0 The CMM was trammed numerous times in this area during the investigation with no adverse effects.\xa0 The width of the entry at the location of the accident measured approximately 19 feet wide by 8 feet high.\xa0 After the victim was removed, the cutter head of the CMM was located 12.5 inches from the right coal rib (see Appendix C).Continuous Mining MachineThe No. 254 CMM was manufactured by Joy Global Inc., Serial Number JM5801, Model 14CM15. \xa0The MSHA approval number is 2G-4159A-0.\xa0 MSHA personnel conducted visual examinations and basic functional tests on this CMM, along with the remote control transmitter, including tram and hydraulic functions.\xa0 These visual examinations and basic functional tests revealed no deficiencies.Proximity Detection SystemThe PDS is designed to prevent injury by activating audio and visual warnings when a miner approaches a CMM and stopping movement before contact is made.At the time of the accident, all CMMs in operation on the coal producing sections of the mine had a PDS.\xa0 The No. 254 CMM had a Joy SmartZone Generation 2 PDS manufactured by Matrix Design Group. \xa0It was installed by Joy Global Inc. during a rebuild before the CMM was placed into service at the mine on February 3, 2017.The PDS uses an electromagnetic field and a line of sight radio signal to allow communication between components that are permanently installed on the CMM and those worn by a miner. \xa0When the miner wearable component (MWC) enters a certain area in the electromagnetic field, the machine-mounted components and MWC recognize the intrusion and relay the appropriate signal to the system.The PDS on the CMM is set up to identify warning and shutdown zones.\xa0 If a miner enters the warning zone, a yellow light flashes at all four corners of the CMM and the MWC flashes a yellow light and sounds a slow beeping signal.\xa0 If a miner enters the shutdown zone, a red light flashes at all four corners of the CMM and the MWC flashes a red light with a fast beeping signal, and the tram and conveyor boom swing functions of the CMM are disabled. \xa0In addition, when electronic communication or MWC with CMM operator-association is lost, the PDS will disable the CMM tram and conveyor swing functions.The PDS and MWCs for the CMMs were examined by the investigation team, which found no physical damage or abnormalities that would affect the ability of the PDS to stop the machine before contacting a miner.\xa0 Data retrieved from the PDS on the No. 254 CMM indicated that the victim’s MWC was properly communicating with the PDS.\xa0 Static measurements and dynamic tests of the PDS indicated the CMM would stop before contacting a miner (see Appendix D).Proximity Detection System OverrideThe emergency stop override (ESO) function is activated by a switch on the remote control transmitter used to operate the CMM.Under MSHA’s proximity detection standard (Title 30 CFR § 75.1732), the only reason to override the PDS is to move a disabled CMM from an unsafe location for the purpose of repair.\xa0 Additionally, § 75.1732(b)(4) of the rule requires an audible or visual warning signal to be activated when the PDS is being overridden.\xa0However, the No. 254 CMM was configured so that when the override was engaged, the warning signals ceased functioning.\xa0 When investigators used the ESO to override the PDS, they confirmed there was no audible or visual warning signal.\xa0 Investigators learned that Joy Global Inc. had set up or commissioned the PDS to operate this way on the No. 254 CMM and the three other CMMs on the working sections in the mine.\xa0 MSHA issued noncontributing citations for the other three CMMs because § 75.1732(b)(4) was violated.In order to determine the sequence of events before and during the accident the data from the No. 254 CMM was converted to accelerometer graphs and recorded playback of the computer simulation tool.\xa0 Also, logs were made of MWC associations and the ESO activation times. \xa0Investigators found that the victim activated the ESO six times in the 16 minutes he operated the No. 254 CMM before the accident.\xa0 The victim was in the Red Zone three of those times.MSHA Technical Support investigators determined that the victim engaged the ESO for the last time at 8:43 p.m. EDT.\xa0 For the next 14 seconds, the ESO remained engaged while the MWC moved along the right side of the machine and into the shutdown zone. The movement stopped near the right side of the cutter head.\xa0 The data is consistent with the MWC being worn by the victim while he was walking along the right side of the CMM as described.For approximately seven more minutes, the CMM remained energized while the graphs and playback show no movement of the MWC.\xa0 This indicated to investigators that the victim was struck at 8:43 p.m., and the MWC he was wearing did not move after he was struck.At 8:47 p.m., other MWCs started to appear around the No. 254 CMM, and limited movement of the victim’s MWC began at 8:50 pm.\xa0 At 9:02 p.m., the victim’s MWC, accompanied by other MWCs, traveled outby the CMM and out of range.\xa0 This information is consistent with facts gathered by investigators concerning the events that took place after the accident when miners gathered at the scene, recovered the victim, and transported him away from the working section.The data revealed that the ESO was used 87 times from the beginning of the shift until the time of the accident, totaling over 57 minutes during the shift.\xa0 It was used approximately 1,000 times in the week prior to the accident, totaling 14 hours and 53 minutes.\xa0 This data indicate the ESO was used frequently to override the PDS and was a common practice during regular production shifts.\xa0In interviews, CMM operators Casey Harris, Stacey Harris, and William Daniels stated the ESO was being misused to save time while moving CMMs from one place to another, and mine management was aware of it.In contrast, Adkins; Steve Gibson, Mine Foreman; Charles Maynard, 2nd Shift Chief Electrician; George Jones, 3rd Shift Maintenance Foreman; and Delano Kirby, No. 1 Section Dayshift Foreman said they were not aware that the ESO was being used to override the PDS in nonemergency situations.InterferenceSources of interference were investigated and none contributed to the fatal accident.Testing and ExaminationThe mine operator’s examination records indicate that a pre-shift examination is conducted three times per day on the 010-0/011-0 MMU’s No.1 working section.\xa0 The pre-shift and the on-shift examination records did not show any hazards or violations for the day of the accident.\xa0 The last weekly examination of the No. 254 CMM was conducted on June 5, 2017, which indicated that a trailing cable splice had been repaired.\xa0 No other hazards or violations were reported.Based on testimony of the CMM operators, only static testing of the PDS was being conducted prior to the operation of the CMMs on both working sections.\xa0 Because no dynamic testing was being conducted prior to the accident, a noncontributory citation was issued for violating 30 CFR § 75.1732(c)(1)(i).Roof Control PlanThe mine’s roof control plan, which was approved by MSHA on February 22, 2017, contains provisions for Red Zone protection.\xa0 The following requirements for safe operating of the CMM are under the heading “Continuous Miner Tramming:” \xa0When the continuous miner is being trammed anywhere in the mine, other than when cutting or loading coal, no person shall be allowed along either side of the CMM.\nDuring mining and place changing with the remote control miners: all persons shall be positioned in an area that will afford maximum protection to themselves and others from unsupported roof and moving equipment.\n\u200bDuring place changing, all persons involved in the move shall be positioned in an area outside the Red Zone of the continuous miner at all times while the miner is being trammed.\xa0 If an operator’s compartment is provided and a cab or canopy is required due to the mining height, then the continuous miner shall be trammed from the compartment.\nRed Zone Precautions: \xa0Continuous Miner Tramming states:\xa0 When tramming the CMM to the next place, other than when cutting or loading coal, no one will be located along either side of the CMM, and they will be in a safe location outby the boom and head.\xa0 All personnel shall remain at least 4 feet outside the Red Zone in all directions.\nTraining and ExperienceR. S. Osborne had 9 years, 13 weeks, and 5 days total mining experience. He began working at the Gateway Eagle Mine on January 25, 2017.\xa0 R. S. Osborne was assigned to operate the No. 254 CMM on March 10, 2017.\xa0 R. S. Osborne received experienced miner training on January 26, 2017, and annual refresher training on April 1, 2017.The mine operator did not task train R. S. Osborne on the safety aspects and safe operating procedures of the CMM, which included PDS and the ESO, as required by 30 CFR §48.7. \xa0Proper task training would have included the procedures found in the Joy Mining Machinery Remote Operation manual:\xa0Before starting this machine or operating any controls, make certain you have read the Machine Operation book, found in the Introduction unit of the manual, have been trained in the proper operation of this machine, and are thoroughly familiar with all controls. \xa0Failure to do so could result in an accident causing serious injury or death to you or other personnel.The manual also contains a warning statement about the use of the ESO and notes that this statement “call(s) attention to potentially hazardous situations that could result in serious personal injury or death if not avoided. \xa0Injury from these hazards is usually serious in nature, and a severe or fatal accident can occur if proper precautions are not followed.”\xa0 Specifically, the warning statement states:Only use the emergency stop override to tram the machine away from the obstruction that is pressing the EMERGENCY STOP switch. \xa0Never use the override during normal operation. \xa0Failure to comply with this warning may lead to an accident causing severe accident or death from attempting to stop the machine, in an emergency, with an overridden EMERGENCY STOP switch.The victim was using the ESO during normal operations when he was fatally injured.\xa0 In witness interviews, C. Harris, S. Harris, and William Daniels stated the mine operator did not address the safety aspects and safe work procedures of using the ESO during their task training.The preamble to the final PDS rule issued in January, 2015 emphasizes that required task training must include training on overriding the PDS:Overriding the proximity detection system should only occur for the time necessary to move the machine to a safe location…Mine operators must train machine operators, under existing new task training requirements, to relocate a machine to a safe location for repair.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the investigation and the operator’s implemented corrective actions to prevent a reoccurrence of this type of accident.1.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not enforce provisions set forth in the approved Roof Control Plan to prevent miners from working or traveling in the Red Zone of the CMM while it is being moved from place to place or repositioning between cuts.\xa0 The safety provisions are designed to ensure that miners do not enter dangerous areas that present hazards, such as the Red Zone established around the CMM.Corrective Action:\xa0 Management developed an action plan to increase Red Zone safety awareness, and upon approval by MSHA, implemented the plan.\xa0 The provisions to the action plan include Red Zone training, proximity detection training, increased observations, and dynamic testing procedures.\xa0 The action plan requires all miners to receive classroom and underground training regarding potential Red Zone hazards and the operation of the PDS on the CMMs. The action plan also requires a certified foreman to observe each CMM operator during place changes and record the results of the observations in a book on the surface.\xa0 Additionally, the operator revised its roof control plan to include training, observations, and PDS testing to follow Joy Global Inc.’s Smart Zone Proximity Systems User Guide when conducting static and dynamic testing.2.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator allowed a practice of using the ESO to override the PDS during movement of CMMs in nonemergency situations.Corrective Action:\xa0 Management submitted an updated training plan to include proximity training to new miners and experienced miners, and to provide task training on the PDS to all miners working at the mine, which includes Joy Global, Inc.’s recommended testing procedures.\xa0 Management also implemented an emergency stop override policy, which states:Except in the case of an imminent danger to the health and safety of a miner, continuous miner operators SHALL NOT utilize the ESO or other equivalent override procedures for continuous miners at any time unless:\nThe continuous miner operator obtains verbal permission from Mine Management, such as Section Foremen or other appropriate mine management personnel; AND\nMine management must observe the continuous mining machine operator engage the ESO or other equivalent override procedures for continuous mining machines to ensure safe procedures.', 'CONCLUSION': 'The CMM operator was fatally injured when he was pinned between the cutter head of a remote controlled CMM and the coal rib.\xa0 The accident occurred because the mine operator did not enforce the provisions in its approved roof control plan to prevent miners from working or traveling in the Red Zone of the CMM while moving from place to place or repositioning between cuts.\xa0 In addition, the mine operator did not provide administrative controls and acceptable work practices to prevent the proximity detection system from being overridden during normal mining operations.The victim was using the emergency stop override at the time of the accident and had activated it 87 times for over 57 minutes during the shift.\xa0 Furthermore, the PDS on this mining machine was set up or commissioned by Joy Global Inc. in a manner that deactivated the audible or visual warnings when the PDS was being overridden.Approved By:\xa0__________________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ________________Brian M.

DateDistrict Manager', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': '\xa01.103(k) Order, No. 8068571 was issued to Rockwell Mining, LLC.A fatal accident has occurred at this operation on June 13, 2017, at approximately 2100 hours.\xa0 This order is issued under Section 103 (k) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, to assure the safety of all persons at this operation and prevent the destruction of any evidence which would assist in the investigation of the cause and or causes of this accident.\xa0 It prohibits all activity at the 010-0/011-0/012-0/013-0 MMUs until MSHA has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in the area.\xa0 The mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an authorized representative for all actions to recover and/or restore operations to the affected area.2.104(a) Citation, No 8068574, was issued to Rockwell Mining, LLC for a violation of 30 CFR § 75.220(a)(1).\xa0On June 13, 2017, at approximately 8:43 p.m., a fatal accident occurred on the No. 1 working section, (010-0/011-0 MMU).\xa0 A continuous mining machine operator was pinned between the mining machine’s right side cutter head and the coal rib, while moving the mining machine from the No. 3 entry into the last open crosscut. \xa0The operator did not comply with provisions of the approved roof control plan on the No. 1 working Section (010-0 MMU), specifically on 1) page 19:\xa0 “When tramming the CMM to the next place, other than when cutting or loading coal, no one will be located along either side of the CMM, and they will be in a safe location outby the boom and head.\xa0 All personnel shall remain at least 4 feet outside the Red Zone in all directions; 2)\xa0 \xa0page 8, Item #36: “When the continuous miner is being trammed anywhere in the mine, other than when cutting or loading coal, no person shall be allowed along either side of the CMM;”\xa0 3) page 11 Item #1:\xa0 “During mining and place changing with the remote control miners: all persons shall be positioned in an area that will afford maximum protection to themselves and others from unsupported roof and moving equipment;” \xa0and 4) page 11 Item#2:\xa0 “During place changing, all persons involved in the move shall be positioned in an area outside the Red Zone of the continuous miner at all times while the miner is being trammed.\xa0 If an operator’s compartment is provided and a cab or canopy is required due to the mining height, then the continuous miner shall be trammed from the compartment.”During the fatal accident investigation, MSHA determined there was a practice of continuous mining machine operators tramming the CMMs from place to place while they were positioned in the Red Zone.3.104(d)(1) Citation, No. 8068575, was issued to Rockwell Mining, LLC for a violation of 30 CFR § 75.1732(b).\xa0On June 13, 2017, at approximately 8:43 p.m., a fatal accident occurred on the No. 1 working section, (010-0/011-0 MMU).\xa0 A continuous mining machine operator was pinned between the mining machine’s right side cutter head and the coal rib while moving the mining machine from the No. 3 entry into the last open crosscut. \xa0The mine operator did not ensure that the emergency stop override on the No. 254 continuous mining machine, Serial #JM5801, was only used for purposes of relocating the machine from an unsafe location for repair.\xa0 Instead, the emergency stop override was being used by the operator during the movement of the continuous mining machine from one location to another during the mining cycle.\xa0 This action overrides the proximity detection system (PDS) and prevents the system from preventing tram and conveyor boom swing on the continuous mining machine while the operator is positioned in the shutdown zone.\xa0 During the investigation, MSHA Technical Support personnel determined that the emergency stop override of the No. 254 continuous mining machine was used approximately 1,000 times in the week prior to the accident.\xa0 Additionally, it was determined that the emergency stop override was used 87 times on June 13, 2017 between 3:50:00 PM and 8:43:56 PM.\xa0 The total time the continuous mining machine operated in emergency stop override during this period was 57 minutes and 4 seconds.\xa0 Based on the amount of times the emergency stop override was activated, mine management had reason to know the emergency stop override was being used for reasons other than relocating the continuous mining machine from an unsafe location for repair only.\xa0 Therefore, the mine operator also had reason to know the audible or visual alarm did not activate when the proximity detection system (PDS) was being overridden by emergency stop override.During the fatal accident investigation, MSHA determined there was a practice of continuous mining machine operators tramming the CMM from place to place, while they were positioned in the PDS shutdown which is located in the Red Zone.4.104(d)(1) Order, No. 8068576 was issued to Rockwell Mining, LLC for a violation of 30 CFR § 48.7(a).On June 13, 2017, at approximately 8:43 p.m., a fatal accident occurred on the No. 1 working section, (010-0/011-0 MMU).\xa0 A continuous mining machine operator was pinned between the mining machine’s right side cutter head and the coal rib while moving the mining machine from the No. 3 entry into the last open crosscut. \xa0The mine operator did not task train this miner in the safety aspects and safe operating procedures of the continuous mining machine, which included the proximity detection system (PDS) and emergency stop override (ESO).\xa0 The victim was using the ESO when the fatality occurred.\xa0 The use of the ESO overrode the PDS and allowed the mining machine to operate and fatally injure the victim while he was located within the PDS’s shutdown zone.5.104(a) Citation, No. 8068577 was issued to Joy Global, Inc for a violation of 30 CFR § 75.1732(b)Joy Global Inc. initially set up or “commissioned” the proximity detection system on the No. 254 continuous mining machine without the ability to activate an audible or visual warning signal when the proximity detection system (PDS) was

continuous mining machine operator was pinned between the mining machine’s right side cutter head and the coal rib while moving the mining machine from the No. 3 entry into the last open crosscut.\xa0 The proximity detection system on the No. 254 continuous mining machine was inadequate because it would not activate an audible or visual warning signal when the proximity detection system (PDS) was being overridden by the emergency stop override (ESO).\xa0 On June 13, 2017, at approximately 8:43 p.m., a fatal accident occurred on the No. 1 working section, (010-0/011-0 MMU) while the victim was using the ESO.\xa0 The person designated by the mine operator to check the PDS did not ensure that the PDS was functioning properly after it was commissioned.\xa0 During the investigation, MSHA Technical Support personnel determined that the ESO of the No. 254 continuous mining machine was used approximately 1,000 times in the week prior to the accident.\xa0 Additionally, it was determined that the ESO was used 87 times on June 13, 2017 between 3:50:00 PM and 8:43:56 PM.\xa0 The total time the continuous mining machine operated while the ESO was used during this period was 57 minutes

On May 19, 2017, at approximately 12:50 a.m., Rosser was pronounced dead.The accident occurred because the mine operator failed to provide adequate task training and comply with safeguard no. 3991332, issued on August 21, 2013, and the track haulage training plan developed by the operator as a result of the safeguard.\xa0 The safeguard and plan provide that persons riding or operating track mounted vehicles shall not expose themselves to injury by rising up or projecting their arms or legs over the sides of track mounted equipment.\xa0', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'The Pinnacle mine is an underground coal mine operated by Pinnacle Mining Company, LLC, which is a subsidiary of ERP Compliant Fuels.\xa0 The mine is located near Pineville, Wyoming County, West Virginia.\xa0 It operates three production shifts, seven days a week and employs a total of 419 miners.\xa0 Approximately 11,000 tons of raw coal is produced daily from one longwall and two continuous mining sections.\xa0 Belt conveyors transport the raw coal from each working section to a slope belt which transports coal to the surface.\xa0 An elevator transports the miners into and out of the mine, and diesel, battery, and 300 VDC trolley-powered track-mounted vehicles are used to transport miners and supplies throughout the mine.\xa0 The mine is ventilated with five exhausting fans and liberates over 4.5 million cubic feet of methane in a 24 hour period.\xa0 The mine is on a 5-day spot inspection schedule because of excessive methane, in accordance with Section 103(i) of the Mine Act.The principal officers for the mine at the time of the accident were:Mark Nelson……………………………… Director of Mining\nJon Lester………………………………….Senior Vice President\nCurt Taylor………………………………...\xa0General Manager\nJack Watson……………………………….General Mine Foreman\nChad Lester………………………………..Outby Superintendent\nStormy McCoy……………………………\xa0Maintenance Superintendent\nDave Meadows……………………………Safety Manage\nLanny Cline………………………………..Evening Shift ForemanA regular (E01) safety and health inspection was started on April 3, 2017, and was ongoing when the accident occurred.\xa0 The previous regular inspection was completed on March 23, 2017.\xa0 The Non-Fatal Days Lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for the mine was 6.05, compared to the national NFDL incident rate of 3.34 for mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On May 18, 2017, Rosser began his shift at 4:00 p.m. as an outby utility miner.\xa0 Rosser and Tracy Lester, Outby Utility Miner, were instructed by Gerald Cline, Assistant Shift Foreman, to clean the slope belt in the West Mains area of the mine.\xa0 They used the No. 43 Goodman electric locomotive to travel into the mine from the elevator and parked it in the area where the coal sizer is located.\xa0 They then rode with Chris Dodson and Matt Muncy, Outby Utility Miners, in the No. 13 jeep (track-mounted mantrip) to the slope belt.\xa0 Near the end of their shift, Dodson, Muncy, Rosser, and T. Lester used the No. 13 jeep to travel back to the locomotive.\xa0 Rosser and T. Lester then got in the locomotive to travel to the elevator and out of the mine.At approximately 11:00 p.m., while Rosser was operating the locomotive along the 8 haulage extension track, the trolley pole came off the trolley wire near the No. 42 crosscut.\xa0 While the locomotive was still in motion, Rosser rose from his seat to place the trolley pole back on the wire. \xa0He sat back down just as the overhead clearance dropped abruptly from 15 feet to 53½ inches. \xa0A steel beam used as supplemental roof support knocked off Rosser’s hard hat, and as he reached to grab it, his head hit an outby steel beam.\xa0 Lester stated the locomotive came to a complete stop at the No. 39 crosscut and he noticed Rosser was unconscious.With his caplight, Lester signaled Dodson and Muncy who were riding in the No. 13 jeep on their way out of the mine.\xa0 They stopped approximately 3 crosscuts in front of the locomotive.\xa0 Lester then ran to Muncy and Dodson to inform them Rosser had hit his head and was unconscious.\xa0 Lester, Dodson, and Muncy traveled back to No. 39 crosscut to see if Rosser had regained consciousness.\xa0 They removed him from the locomotive and laid him on the mine floor.\xa0 Muncy performed artificial respiration on Rosser while Dodson used ammonia inhalants; however, Rosser did not respond.As Muncy assessed Rosser’s condition, T. Lester used a two-way radio to call the surface; he notified Jeff Davis, Dispatcher, that Rosser was hurt and unconscious.\xa0 Davis immediately informed Lanny Cline, Evening Shift Foreman, of the accident. \xa0At 11:09 p.m., he called 911 to request an ambulance.\xa0 L. Cline also spoke with Lester on the two-way radio and was advised that Rosser was “knocked out.” \xa0In his interview, L. Cline stated he heard Dodson say on the radio that Rosser had a faint pulse.\xa0At about 11:13 p.m., L. Cline told Calvin Roark, Cody Thompson, and Terry McGinnis, Outby Utility Miners, who were \xa0on the No. 36 mantrip and close to the accident area, to assist with Rosser.\xa0 When these three miners arrived at the scene of the accident, they assisted Dodson, Muncy, and Lester in placing Rosser in the mantrip, which then proceeded to the elevator.\xa0 L. Cline also asked Davis to contact G.

Cline met the utility crew at the No. 134 crosscut.\xa0 Grimmett and Mullins got on the mantrip and immediately began to perform CPR on Rosser.\xa0 Thompson also stayed on the mantrip and held Rosser’s head while the mantrip traveled toward the elevator.At 11:30 p.m., STAT Emergency Medical Service paramedics, Chad Cox and Samuel Brown, arrived at the mine.\xa0 After they arrived on the surface with Rosser at about midnight, the paramedics placed him in the ambulance and continued to administer emergency treatment. \xa0The ambulance left the mine at 12:25 a.m. on May 19, 2017, and arrived at Welch Community Hospital in Welch, West Virginia at 12:45 a.m.\xa0 Rosser was pronounced dead by Dr. Anwar Abdeen at 12:50 a.m.\xa0', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': '\xa0On May 18, 2017, at 11:28 p.m., Kenneth Nunn, Safety Specialist, called the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center to report a life threatening injury at the Pinnacle mine. \xa0The Contact Center notified Kenneth Butcher, Logan Field Office Supervisor, at 11:38 p.m. who immediately called Tracy Calloway, Staff Assistant.\xa0 Calloway notified Steven Campbell, Ventilation Specialist/Accident Investigator, of the accident. \xa0Campbell arrived at the mine at 1:11 a.m. on May 19, 2017, and immediately issued a 103(k) order to preserve the accident scene and to prevent the destruction of evidence.\xa0Campbell conducted informal interviews at the mine office with miners who assisted the victim.\xa0 Clark Blackburn, Assistant District Manager (Enforcement), and Landon Grimmett, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Accident Investigator, arrived at the mine at 1:50 a.m. to assist Campbell with the investigation.\xa0 Officials with the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST) and company officials participated in the investigation (see Appendix A).On May 19, 2017, Educational Field and Small Mine Services dispatched John M. Browning, Training Specialist, to the mine to review training records and the company’s training plan.On May 24, 2017, and June 21, 2017, MSHA and WVOMHST jointly conducted formal interviews at MSHA’s District 12 Office in Pineville, West Virginia, (see Appendix A).', 'DISCUSSION': '', 'Equipment Involved': 'The No. 43 Goodman 20 ton electric locomotive, serial number 437004, an electro-pneumatic controlled, 300 VDC trolley-powered, track-mounted vehicle, is used to transport supplies in and out of the mine and is capable of seating 2 persons.\xa0 The locomotive has three types of brakes: dynamic brake, air brakes, and manual linkage.\xa0 On the evening of the accident, the locomotive was examined by MSHA investigators and no deficiencies were observed with the braking system, sanders, the operational controls, or the trolley pole. \xa0The headlights were operating properly and investigators found no deficiencies with lighting or visibility.\xa0 Speed did not appear to be a factor in this accident.Investigators examined the 8 haulage extension track, which is an 85 lb haulage track rail system and the 300 VDC trolley wire in the area where the accident occurred and found no deficiencies.\xa0 The incline of the track between crosscuts No. 41 and No. 42 measured 1.91% grade.\xa0 At the time of the accident, the track was wet due to condensation.\xa0 Investigators examined the trolley wire at the accident scene and there was nothing to indicate why the trolley pole came off the wire at this location.\xa0 The operator had posted low clearance signs measuring only 3 inches by 3 inches approximately 4 crosscuts from the accident area. \xa0The distance between the steel beams in the accident area and the windshield of the No. 43 locomotive measures between 10 inches and 14 inches.\xa0 Rosser would have had to lower his head by bending or leaning over to prevent his head from contacting the steel beams (see Appendices B and C).\xa0', 'Examination': 'The mine operator’s examination records indicate the 8 haulage extension track was being examined each shift.\xa0 The examination records for the day of the accident did not reveal any hazards or violations. \xa0No hazards were documented in the weekly examination record for the No. 43 electric locomotive.', 'Previously Issued Safeguard': 'At the time of the accident, safeguard no. 3991332, issued August 21, 2013, was in effect.\xa0 This safeguard was issued after a similar accident occurred at the mine.\xa0 In that accident, a miner hit his head on the mine roof in a low area of the track haulageway and received permanently disabling injuries as a result; he is now partially paralyzed.\xa0 The safeguard provided that all miners who operate track mounted vehicles be thoroughly trained in their operation. It also required the mine operator to implement a track haulage training plan.\xa0 Management stated in their interview that they probably did not instruct any foreman or anyone else to cover the safeguard or the track haulage training plan when conducting task training. The operator’s plan states:No person shall operate a portal bus or jeep unless he has been thoroughly trained in the safety standards governing the operation of the same.\nPersons riding mantrips shall not expose themselves to injury by raising up or projecting their arms or legs over the sides of the bus or jeep.\nMantrips shall be operated at speeds consistent with the conditions of the haulage road and shall be kept under control at all times.\nMantrips and or jeeps shall slow down at all curves, active turnouts, blind spots and close clearance areas along haulage roads.\nPersons shall ride only in vehicle compartments provided for that purpose.\xa0 Riding on top of locomotives, portal busses, flat cars or other equipment not designated to accommodate riders, is strictly prohibited.\nWe will place a STOP:\xa0 LOW TOP AHEAD PROCEED WITH CAUTION sign near the sizer\nInvestigators learned that standing and grabbing the trolley pole, while the vehicle was in motion, was a common practice at the mine.\xa0 Policies and the safeguard issued by MSHA designed to prevent this practice were not followed at the mine.', 'Experience and Training': 'Rosser began employment at this mine on March 6, 2017, the same day he received annual refresher training.\xa0 Some of the track haulage safety provisions of safeguard no. 3991332 and the operator’s track haulage training plan were in the training documents used during the training.Rosser was task trained on the same type of locomotive involved in the fatal accident.\xa0 Investigators determined that the task training given to Rosser was inadequate.\xa0 Rosser was only trained on the controls of the locomotive as well as the sanders and horn.\xa0 30 CFR § 48.7(a) requires task training to include:Supervised practice during nonproduction. \xa0The training shall include supervised practice in the assigned tasks, and the performance of work duties at times or places where production is not the primary objective; orSupervised operation during production. \xa0The training shall include, while under direct and immediate supervision and production is in progress, operation of the machine or equipment and the performance of work duties.Rosser did not receive any supervised practice or supervised operation prior to operating the locomotive.\xa0 In addition to 30 CFR § 48.7(a), this task training was required by safeguard No. 3991332 and the associated track haulage training plan.Because the task training was not recorded, investigators could not determine when that training took place.\xa0 A noncontributory citation was issued for a violation of 30 CFR § 48.9(a) for failure to record the training.\xa0\xa0Two more safeguards (as per 30 CFR §75.1403) were issued after the fatal accident on June 27, 2017.\xa0 One required the operator to train all miners to bring the No. 43 locomotive and all other track mounted vehicles to a complete stop before placing trolley poles back on the trolley wire.\xa0 It also mandated that all miners be trained on this safeguard and that the operators record the training.\xa0 The other safeguard required the operator to install warning lights, reflectors, and reflective signs along all track haulage and rail haulage roads where abrupt or sudden changes in overhead clearance exist that pose a hazard to miners.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': '\xa0MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions implemented to prevent reoccurrence.Root Cause: \xa0The mine operator failed to adequately task train the victim on the electric locomotive he was operating at the time of the accident.\xa0 The mine operator only trained the victim on the controls of the locomotive.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator trained all miners who operate locomotives and all other track-mounted electric equipment.\xa0 The training specifically included an instruction that when the trolley pole comes off the trolley wire, the track mounted vehicle must come to a complete stop and the parking brake set prior to placing the trolley pole back on the trolley wire.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator failed to ensure miners were properly trained and were complying with the provisions set forth in the safeguard, issued by MSHA on August 21, 2013, as well as the provisions set forth in the tack haulage training plan developed by the operator in response to the safeguard.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The operator re-trained all underground miners on the provisions of the safeguard no. 3991332 issued August 21, 2013, and on the track haulage training plan.\n\xa0', 'CONCLUSION': '\xa0The victim received fatal injuries when his head struck a steel beam installed as supplemental roof support.\xa0 The accident occurred due to the operator’s failure to adequately task train the victim, comply with safeguard no. 3991332 issued on August 21, 2013, and comply with the track haulage training plan developed for this mine.\xa0Signed by:\xa0_________________________________________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ________________Brian M.

777F haul truck he was operating went over a highwall. \xa0The victim was backing up his haul truck to dump his load of overburden when the ground under the truck failed.\xa0 The haul truck, with the victim inside, fell backwards over the highwall edge to the bottom of the pit containing dumped overburden. \xa0The truck traveled approximately 150 feet before coming to a stop.\xa0The accident occurred because the mine operator did not ensure that haul truck drivers dumped their loads a safe distance from the highwall.\xa0 Also, the mine operator had knowledge that unsafe dumping was a practice at the mine.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'The Rosebud Mine & Crusher/Conveyor is a surface mine operated by Western Energy Company and owned by Westmoreland Coal Company. \xa0The mine is located near Colstrip, Montana. \xa0Overburden is removed exposing the Rosebud coal seam utilizing four draglines and is deposited in previously mined pit areas. \xa0The coal is loaded by front-end loaders into 100 ton and 200 ton haul trucks for transport to areas where the coal is stockpiled. \xa0The coal seam averages 20 to 25 feet in thickness and overburden thicknesses vary from 20 feet to more than 200 feet.The mine employs 370 miners and operates seven days a week, with two 12 hour production shifts and two 12 hour maintenance shifts per day.\xa0 \xa0The mine produces approximately 20,000 tons of coal per day.The principal officials for the mine at the time of the accident were:Lukas Klemke……………………………………..Mine ManagerJerry Gillespie……………………………....Production ManagerNora Buchholz…………………………………...Safety ManagerLeRoy Sessions…………………………...Maintenance ManagerThe last regular safety and health inspection (E01) conducted by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) was completed on February 2, 2017. \xa0The Non-Fatal Days Lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for the mine in 2016 was 0.78, compared to the national NFDL incident rate of 0.74 for mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'Haul truck driver Michael Ramsey arrived for work on Saturday, May 6, 2017, at 6 a.m. He was a member of Crew 3, along with haul truck drivers Rob Moore and Matt Nelson. \xa0\xa0The three drivers received instructions for their shift from Ed Buchholz, Crew 4 Supervisor, who worked the night shift.\xa0 They were assigned to haul overburden from the Cat 993 loader number LD 11 and dump it into the pit between the C-1 South and B-9 ramps.\xa0 The drivers got to their equipment at approximately 6:15 a.m. \xa0Ramsey performed a pre-operational examination on his Caterpillar 777F haul truck, and the documentation shows he did not detect any safety defects or other issues with the truck.The shift progressed normally, with all three trucks dumping their loads at the same dump point.\xa0 The trucks dumped approximately 300 loads, when at approximately 4:40 p.m., Ramsey’s truck was loaded with 98 tons of overburden.\xa0 Ramsey drove to the dump but did not return to the loader.\xa0 At about 4:50 p.m., Moore, whose truck was next in the loading cycle, approached the dump point at the crest of the highwall and noticed a section of the berm was gone. \xa0He dumped his 100 ton load short to block the gap in the berm. \xa0He then radioed Nelson to inform him that the berm was gone and that he had dumped his load short.Rich Hart, Loader Operator, noticed Ramsey was missing from the rotation and asked over the radio if anyone knew Ramsey’s location.\xa0 Nelson arrived at the dumping location and saw a haul truck upside down at the bottom of the pit.\xa0 He radioed Stephan Hanson, Gate Guard, and requested he announce a “mayday” over the radio and give out the accident location.\xa0 At 5:00 p.m. Hanson announced the mayday over all mine radio channels and he called 911 for assistance.\xa0 \xa0Charlie Charette, Crew 3 Supervisor in Areas A, B, and D, and James Fulkerson, Crew 3 Supervisor in Area C, heard Hanson say over the radio that a truck went over the highwall.David Murch, Bulldozer Operator, arrived on the scene at the top of the highwall.\xa0 He tried to communicate verbally with Ramsey but did not receive any response. \xa0Charette traveled to the bottom of the pit in an attempt to get to Ramsey.\xa0 Charette was only able to get within several hundred feet of the truck because of water in the bottom of the pit.\xa0 He contacted two bulldozer operators in the area to travel to the spoil side of the pit and start building a road to the truck.Troy Cozzens, Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) and Rescue Team Member (RTM), and Jason Serrano, RTM, arrived at the top of the highwall. \xa0Cozzens rappelled over the wall and was the first person to reach the haul truck location.\xa0 He found Ramsey unresponsive. \xa0Cozzens informed Serrano they would need additional assistance. \xa0Cozzens removed Ramsey’s seatbelt and lowered him to the roof of the haul truck to check for vitals. \xa0Cameron Ator, RTM, arrived to help Cozzens and they started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), continuing the procedure for about 30 minutes. There was no response from the victim.\xa0 Meryl Young, RTM, also arrived with necessary equipment to rescue Ramsey.Dan Allerdings, EMT and RTM, stayed at the top of the highwall to communicate with Colstrip Ambulance personnel who arrived at the top of the highwall at 5:27 p.m. \xa0Shawn Haig, Colstrip Ambulance Attendant, contacted Dr. Jose Ortiz at the Colstrip Medical Clinic to inform him of the 30 minutes of CPR and that Ramsey had not responded. \xa0Dr. Ortiz instructed Haig to cease further resuscitation and recover the victim. \xa0Haig relayed the information to the rescue team.Cozzens, Serrano, and Young secured Ramsey to a backboard at the truck. \xa0Ramsey was then lifted out of the pit.\xa0 Alan Fulton, Rosebud County Coroner, arrived at the mine and pronounced Ramsey dead at 7:25 p.m.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On May 6, 2017, at 5:43 p.m., Charette notified the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center that a serious accident had occurred at Rosebud Mine & Crusher/Conveyor.\xa0 MSHA issued a noncontributory citation for a violation of § 30 CFR 50.10 because the mine operator did not contact MSHA immediately, at once, without delay, and within 15 minutes.William Vetter, Coal District 9 Health Supervisor, was notified by the Contact Center of the accident on the district’s emergency cell phone at 5:58 p.m.\xa0 At 6:32 p.m., he issued a 103(j) order over the telephone to Walt Shaw, Maintenance Superintendent, to preserve the accident scene.David Hamilton, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Accident Investigator, and James Branson, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, were dispatched from the Gillette, Wyoming Field Office to the mine. \xa0When they arrived, they modified the 103(j) order to a 103(k) order.\xa0 They also took preliminary statements from persons having knowledge of the facts and circumstances concerning the accident and conducted a preliminary investigation of the scene.On May 7, 2017, Hamilton and Branson examined the existing physical conditions at the accident scene. \xa0They also took digital photographs and relevant measurements of the scene and reviewed training, mine examination, equipment, and maintenance records. \xa0MSHA held formal interviews at the mine on May 7, 2017.\xa0 Additional interviews were conducted on May 9, 10, 11, 16, and 18, 2017 (see Appendix A).\xa0 The investigation was conducted in conjunction with the company, the miners’ representative, and the State of Montana Safety and Health Bureau, Mine Section.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Location of Accident, Conditions, and Dump PracticeThe truck went over the highwall in Area B between the C-1 south ramp and B-9 ramp (see Appendix B). \xa0The highwall is at the boundary line of the mine permit. \xa0The haul road on top of the highwall is 50 feet wide. \xa0The haul trucks were using a right hand traffic pattern traveling east to west along the highwall edge.\xa0 When the trucks reached the dump location they would turn left, backup to the edge, and dump over a berm.\xa0 The berm, which consisted of soil and clay, was located at the edge of the highwall and measured four foot eight inches high by five foot six inches wide.The ground where the truck was dumping failed, creating an opening at the edge of the highwall causing the truck to fall.\xa0 The opening was approximately 24 feet wide and extended up to 10 feet back from the edge of the highwall.\xa0 The operating width of a Cat 777 truck is 21 feet 4 inches.Company Policies and Unsafe Dump PracticesThe dump practice described above did not comply with Western Energy Company’s safety manual and standard operating guideline, which state:Safety manual (2014) excerpt 6.23:No equipment shall work on top of the highwall within twenty five (25) feet of the vertical un-shot edge and at no time shall the equipment move or work parallel within twenty-five (25) feet of the edge.Standard Operating Guideline (March 3, 2014):When dumping off a highwall, end dumps should dump short, with the bulldozers pushing material off of the highwall until a dump point can be solidly established on spoil material.Investigators learned that unsafe dump practices were commonly performed by several crews, including the victim’s crew.\xa0 These crews routinely operated equipment within 25 feet of the highwall, and their trucks did not dump short so that bulldozers could push overburden over the highwall.\xa0 If trucks dumped short, overburden material would have been present more than 25 feet from the highwall.\xa0 Investigators did not find overburden material in this location.At the time of the accident, no bulldozer was being used to push overburden over the highwall, and from interviews, investigators learned that the bulldozer closest to the accident site was approximately 1,300 feet away from the highwall.\xa0 The 25-foot provision was also listed in the mine operator’s safety program (required by 30 CFR § 77.1708).On Thursday, May 4, 2017, two days before the accident, Alan Raymond, Motor Grader Operator and Miners’ Representative, observed tire marks in a berm at the highwall 200 feet from the accident scene.\xa0 This indicated to him that unsafe dumping practices were occurring at this location. \xa0He believed trucks were repeatedly pounding into the berms when dumping, causing the berms to be pushed back toward the edge of the highwall, to the point where the berms were in danger of giving way or failing.\xa0 Raymond believed a miner would get hurt or die if this practice continued.\xa0 He immediately exercised the mine operator’s “stop work authority” provision and informed E. Buchholz, the Crew 4 Supervisor, of his concerns regarding the unsafe practice and the potential injury or death to a miner.\xa0 Western Energy Company’s safety manual states the following regarding stop work authority:Western Energy Company expects each employee to accept the responsibility for his or her own personal safety, as well as the safety of their co-workers; to observe all safety rules; and to constantly promote safety through both work and actions.\xa0 All employees and visitors are empowered with STOP WORK AUTHORITY.\xa0 If you observe unsafe activity, it is your responsibility to speak up.\xa0 You have the authority to stop work until it is safe, and there will be no repercussions to you.Raymond notified E. Buchholz and E. Buchholz immediately ordered that loading, hauling, and dumping activities in the area be stopped so he could ensure everyone on Crew 3 was aware they were not to dump over the berm.E. Buchholz then used the radio to address miners in Crew 3 working in the area.\xa0 He stated to them that the procedure was to dump short and push loads over the highwall when the angle of repose had not been established.\xa0 Each member of the crew confirmed verbally that they understood.E. Buchholz had a separate discussion with Charette and told him that the crews should be dumping short and pushing over in the area at issue.\xa0 He also told Charette that the overburden should not be dumped in one location, but from different locations along the highwall.\xa0 This way a bulldozer operator could keep up with pushing overburden over the highwall.During the night shift on May 4, 2017, E. Buchholz traveled to the berm area and took a photograph of the tire tracks (see Appendix C). \xa0His intention was to show the photo to Richard Sheridan, the supervisor of the previous shift (Thursday day shift), so that Sheridan could discuss it with his crew.\xa0 However, E. Buchholz told investigators he did not have a chance to show the photograph to anyone prior to the accident.Investigators were not able to determine if, prior to the accident, trucks impacted the berm at the location where the victim’s truck went over the highwall.\xa0 However, it was clear that the company’s dump short and 25 foot policies were not followed at either location.Weather ConditionsThe weather was not a factor in the accident. The haul roads were dry. \xa0Normal temperatures were present without precipitation and visibility was clear.ExaminationsInvestigators reviewed the on-shift examination records and questioned examiners.\xa0 Mine examiners reported they did not find any hazards related to the highwall, dump location, or the truck on the day of the accident.Caterpillar 777F Haul TruckOn May 12, 2017, the mine completed the access road to the haul truck. \xa0On that day, MSHA investigators took photographs and performed a preliminary inspection in and around the truck; they found no obvious defects.The vehicle involved in the accident was equipped with the Vital Information Monitoring System (VIMS).\xa0 VIMS uses numerous sensors to provide information on vital machine functions and alert the driver of an impending or abnormal condition.\xa0 On May 18, 2017, VIMS data for the truck was downloaded by Steve Clark, Field Technical Representative, for Tractor & Equipment Company (T&E), of Billings, Montana.\xa0 Investigators were present and all events and payload data from March 1, 2017 through May 6, 2017, were shared with MSHA.\xa0 Investigators determined the VIMS data did not contain any information related to the accident.On May 31, 2017, Guy Barbera, P.E. Senior Engineer, Jacobson Forensic Engineering, Inc. of Littleton, Colorado, performed four brake tests: park brake test, park brake release, rear service brake, and front service brake on the Caterpillar 777F truck 982. \xa0Barbera checked the accumulators, which store energy that the brake system will use when there is a loss of power to the brake system.\xa0 He also checked the thickness of the brake pads. \xa0All tests and measurements were found to be within the parameters specified by Caterpillar.The truck also had an engine control module (ECM), integrated braking control (IBC), and transmission/chassis control systems (TCC).\xa0 These systems control operation of the truck, monitor operation, and provide diagnostic warnings to the driver.\xa0 These systems also store diagnostic and event codes for abnormal conditions and abnormal operation.\xa0 Barbera downloaded the diagnostic and event code information from these systems. \xa0These systems indicated there were no abnormal conditions or operation before the accident.\xa0 No information was recorded on these systems during and after the accident.\xa0 Investigators found the haul truck had no safety defects that could have contributed to the accident.Training and ExperienceRamsey had 10 years and 18 weeks experience at this mine as a haul truck operator.\xa0 Ramsey received task training on the Caterpillar 777 end dump trucks on January 3, 2016.\xa0 During the task training, Jennifer Leigh, Truck Driver, demonstrated and explained proper dumping techniques, including the use of the dump lever control.\xa0 LeiLeigh also observed Ramsey operate the truck, including dumping.\xa0 Ramsey completed annual refresher training on April 7, 2017.Kathy Cattles, Training Specialist, examined all of Ramsey’s training records and found that his training was in accordance with 30 CFR § Part 48.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \xa0Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the investigation and the operator’s implemented corrective actions to prevent a reoccurrence of this type of accident.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not ensure that trucks dumped a safe distance from the highwall. \xa0Also, the operator had knowledge that unsafe dump practices were a practice at the mine.\xa0 The truck fell because it was too close to the highwall and the ground at the dumping place did not support its weight.Corrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator submitted a revised ground control plan, which specifically states: “Berms will not be used as a stop under any circumstances.\xa0 Trucks will not dump over the highwall under any circumstances.\xa0 Trucks will dump short and material will be pushed over by bulldozers in any situation where the angle of repose has not been established.\xa0 The minimum distance for trucks to dump in this situation will be 25 feet from the vertical un-shot edge above any highwall.\xa0 At no time shall any trucks move or work parallel within 25 feet of the highwall edge.”\xa0 All truck drivers and bulldozer operators have been trained in the revised ground control plant.\xa0 To ensure that the ground control plan is being followed, the mine operator has placed a bulldozer at the dump site.\xa0 The bulldozer operator communicates with the truck drivers to tell them where to dump.\xa0 In addition, stakes have been installed 25 feet from the highwall so that truck drivers can see where to stop their trucks.', 'CONCLUSION': 'On May 6, 2017, at approximately 4:45 p.m., Michael Ramsey received fatal injuries when the Caterpillar 777F haul truck he was operating went over a highwall.\xa0 The victim was backing up his haul truck to dump his load of overburden when the ground under the truck failed, and the haul truck with the victim inside fell backwards to the bottom of the pit containing dumped overburden.\xa0 The truck traveled approximately 150 feet before coming to a stop.\xa0The accident occurred because the mine operator did not ensure that haul trucks dumped their loads a safe distance from the highwall.\xa0 Also, the mine operator had knowledge that unsafe dumping was a practice at the mine.\xa0Approved By:\xa0______________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 _____________Richard A.

driver michael ramsey arrived for work on saturday, may 6, 2017, at 6 a.m. he was a member of crew 3, along with haul truck drivers rob moore and matt nelson.   the three drivers received instructions for their shift from ed buchholz, crew 4 supervisor, who worked the night shift.  they were assigned to haul overburden from the cat 993 loader number ld 11 and dump it into the pit between the c-1 south and b-9 ramps.  the drivers got to their equipment at approximately 6:15 a.m.  ramsey performed a pre-operational examination on his caterpillar 777f haul truck, and the documentation shows he did not detect any safety defects or other issues with the truck.the shift progressed normally, with all three trucks dumping their loads at the same dump point.  the trucks dumped approximately 300 loads, when at approximately 4:40 p.m., ramsey’s truck was loaded with 98 tons of overburden.  ramsey drove to the dump but did not return to the loader.  at about 4:50 p.m., moore, whose truck was next in the loading cycle, approached the dump point at the crest of the highwall and noticed a section of the berm was gone.  he dumped his 100 ton load short to block the gap in the berm.  he then radioed nelson to inform him that the berm was gone and that he had dumped his load short.rich hart, loader operator, noticed ramsey was missing from the rotation and asked over the radio if anyone knew ramsey’s location.  nelson arrived at the dumping location and saw a haul truck upside down at the bottom of the pit.  he radioed stephan hanson, gate guard, and requested he announce a “mayday” over the radio and give out the accident location.  at 5:00 p.m. hanson announced the mayday over all mine radio channels and he called 911 for assistance.   charlie charette, crew 3 supervisor in areas a, b, and d, and james fulkerson, crew 3 supervisor in area c, heard hanson say over the radio that a truck went over the highwall.david murch, bulldozer operator, arrived on the scene at the top of the highwall.  he tried to communicate verbally with ramsey but did not receive any response.  charette traveled to the bottom of the pit in an attempt to get to ramsey.  charette was only able to get within several hundred feet of the truck because of water in the bottom of the pit.  he contacted two bulldozer operators in the area to travel to the spoil side of the pit and start building a road to the truck.troy cozzens, emergency medical technician (emt) and rescue team member (rtm), and jason serrano, rtm, arrived at the top of the highwall.  cozzens rappelled over the wall and was the first person to reach the haul truck location.  he found ramsey unresponsive.  cozzens informed serrano they would need additional assistance.  cozzens removed ramsey’s seatbelt and lowered him to the roof of the haul truck to check for vitals.  cameron ator, rtm, arrived to help cozzens and they started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr), continuing the procedure for about 30 minutes. there was no response from the victim.  meryl young, rtm, also arrived with necessary equipment to rescue ramsey.dan allerdings, emt and rtm, stayed at the top of the highwall to communicate with colstrip ambulance personnel who arrived at the top of the highwall at 5:27 p.m.  shawn haig, colstrip ambulance attendant, contacted dr. jose ortiz at the colstrip medical clinic to inform him of the 30 minutes of cpr and that ramsey had not responded.  dr. ortiz instructed haig to cease further resuscitation and recover the victim.  haig relayed the information to the rescue team.cozzens, serrano, and young secured ramsey to a backboard at the truck.  ramsey was then lifted out of the pit.  alan fulton, rosebud county coroner, arrived at the mine and pronounced ramsey dead at 7:25 p.m."

Gates, District Manager', 'OVERVIEW': 'On Friday, December 2, 2016, at approximately 11:00 a.m., a 36-year-old shield designer and engineer was fatally injured when the longwall shield he was working on collapsed and fell on him.\xa0 The victim was in the process of installing hydraulic components on the tilt cylinder.\xa0 His co-worker, who was working with the victim, removed plugs from both support cylinders which depressurized the hydraulic system and caused the shield to collapse.\xa0 The victim was asphyxiated by the weight of the shield.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'The Oak Grove Mine, owned and operated by Oak Grove Resources LLC., was controlled by ERP Compliant Fuels, LLC at the time of the accident.\xa0 The mine is located near Hueytown, Jefferson County, Alabama.\xa0 This is an underground bituminous coal mine, which uses both longwall and continuous mining methods. \xa0Coal is mined and placed on a conveyor belt and transported to the preparation plant for processing and shipment.\xa0 The primary coal seam mined is the Blue Creek seam which is approximately seven feet thick.\xa0 The mine currently has 377 underground miners and 44 surface miners. \xa0Coal is mined three shifts per day, Monday through Saturday, with maintenance work performed on Sunday.The mine produces approximately 824 tons of coal daily and liberates 3,774,681 cubic feet of methane in a 24 hour period.The principal officials of the mine at the time of the accident were:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Larry Millburg……………………….General Mine Manager\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Larry McCarty……………………….Mine Superintendent\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 James D. Morris……………………...Safety ManagerThe last quarterly safety and health inspection was completed by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) on September 29, 2016. A quarterly inspection was ongoing at the time of the accident.\xa0 The mine operator’s Non-Fatal Days Lost (NFDL) incidence rate for 2015 was 1.84. \xa0The national incidence rate for underground coal mines of this type in 2015 was 3.13.', 'DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On Friday, December 2, 2016, at approximately 6:15 a.m., Qian Yujun (victim), Shield Designer and Engineer, and Liang Shengping, Sales Manager and Translator for Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery (Group) Co. Ltd (ZMJ), arrived at the mine’s North Portal to prepare for their first day underground. \xa0Oak Grove is the first mine in the United States to purchase longwall shields from the People’s Republic of China.\xa0 Around 7:00 a.m., Qian and Liang joined the mine’s longwall set-up crew and entered the mine using the service hoist.\xa0 At approximately 7:15 a.m., the crew boarded a rail mounted mantrip and traveled to the 17 East Longwall Panel.William Bonner, Longwall Foreman, held a safety meeting with the longwall set-up crew.\xa0 Donnie Tisdale, General Inside Laborer, and Brandon Wright, Longwall Mechanic, were assigned to work with Qian and Liang.\xa0 While Tisdale and Wright gathered hand tools, Qian and Liang walked to the set-up face with Jack Rexrode, Maintenance Foreman.\xa0 Rexrode asked Qian to inspect the hydraulic components on longwall shields 186 through 172 that had been previously installed by Oak Grove employees.Tisdale and Wright arrived at the tailgate side of the set-up face and met with Qian and Liang.\xa0 The four men then walked to the headgate side of the set-up face and loaded hydraulic components on a battery-powered longwall shield hauler.\xa0 Rexrode left to check on miners working at another location.\xa0 Qian and Liang returned to the tailgate side of the set-up face. \xa0Tisdale and Wright took the longwall shield hauler around the back entry to the tailgate side of the set up face. \xa0The four men unloaded the hydraulic components and placed them by the shields where they would be installed.\xa0 Tisdale and Wright took the shield hauler back to the headgate. \xa0Qian and Liang walked to shield 171 (serial number 075) to begin installing hydraulic components.Qian crawled behind the two support leg cylinders of shield 171 to install low flow yield valves on the tilt cylinder.\xa0 While Qian was located in the pinch point, behind the support cylinders, he instructed Liang to remove the ⅜ inch pipe plug from the tailgate side support cylinder, in preparation for the installation of a pressure gauge.\xa0 This action depressurized the tailgate side support leg cylinder and placed all of the weight of the shield canopy on the headgate side support leg cylinder.\xa0Qian, still working on the tilt cylinder, instructed Liang to remove a ½ inch pipe plug without specifying from which support cylinder.\xa0 Liang removed the ½ inch plug from the headgate side support leg cylinder, which depressurized the cylinder, causing the shield to collapse.\xa0Liang immediately called for help. \xa0Wayne Ingle, Longwall Electrician, and Grady Robinson, Longwall Shearer Operator, were working approximately 75 feet away and heard Liang.\xa0 They could see that shield 171 had collapsed behind Liang. \xa0Ingle, Wright, and Tisdale ran toward the tailgate while Robinson ran to the headgate to get the hydraulic pump started to pressurize the shield.Ingle attempted to communicate with the victim when he arrived at shield 171, but there was no response.Robinson notified Rexrode and the rest of the crew that a shield had collapsed. \xa0He started the hydraulic pump which sent hydraulic fluid to the shield line.\xa0 Bonner notified persons on the surface of the accident and Rexrode and Bonner went to the accident scene.Upon arrival at the scene, Rexrode manually activated the valve control, in an attempt to raise the collapsed shield.\xa0 Oil flowed freely from the unplugged port on the tailgate support cylinder, preventing activation of the cylinder.\xa0 Rexrode plugged this open port and again attempted to raise the shield. \xa0This attempt also failed, as oil also flowed freely from the open port on the headgate side support cylinder.\xa0 Rexrode then plugged the headgate side cylinder and the shield was successfully raised.\xa0 Two wooden crib blocks were placed on the pan line to securely block the shield in position.Matt Miller, Longwall Stage Loader Operator and Mine Rescue/First Aid Team Member, arrived at the scene.\xa0 Miller checked the victim’s vital signs and found none. \xa0The victim was placed on a stretcher and transported to the surface area of the mine.Phillip Russell, Jefferson County Deputy Coroner, arrived at the mine site and pronounced the victim dead at 12:02 p.m. \xa0An autopsy was performed by the Jefferson County Coroner/Medical Examiner Office. \xa0The cause of death was listed as mechanical asphyxia.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'Ronald Caudill, MSHA Health Specialist, was at the mine performing inspection work.\xa0 At approximately 11:00 a.m., Benny Long, Oak Grove Mine Employee, notified Caudill that an accident had occurred.\xa0 Caudillissued a 103(k) order to Michael Richardson, Safety Supervisor, to ensure the safety of all persons and to prevent the destruction of evidence.\xa0 Caudill traveled to the accident scene and conducted a preliminary examination of the area.Caudill informed Danny Crumpton, MSHA Assistant District Manager (Enforcement), of the accident. \xa0Timothy Stockman, MSHA Coal Mine Inspector; Ed Boylen, MSHA Field Office Supervisor; and Steve Womack, MSHA Assistant District Manager (Technical), were sent to the mine.At 11:05 a.m., James Morris, Safety Manager, notified the Department of Labor National Contact Center of the accident.After the accident investigation team arrived at the mine, they informally interviewed 20 people.\xa0 After the interviews were completed, Caudill and Stockman traveled underground to the accident scene and began their investigation.On Sunday, December 4, 2016, Ron Medina, MSHA Technical Support Mechanical Division; Leon Ko, MSHA Technical Support Electrical Division; and Richard A. Gates, MSHA District Manager, along with Caudill and Stockman, traveled to the mine to continue the accident investigation.Persons participating in the investigation are listed in Appendix A. \xa0The report prepared by MSHA Technical Support is in Appendix B.', 'DISCUSSION': 'EquipmentThe primary purpose of the longwall shields is to provide temporary roof support during longwall mining operations. \xa0The Oak Grove Mine recently purchased 188 longwall face shields and 8 gate shields from ZMJ. \xa0Each face shield weighs 28.6 U.S. tons and each gate shield weighs 32 U.S. tons.\xa0 Each face shield and each gate shield is equipped with two double acting leg cylinders. \xa0Each cylinder has a working load rating of 595 U.S. tons at 6,110 psi.\xa0 The canopy of each shield weighs 9.6 U.S. tons and each caving shield weighs 5 U.S. tons.\xa0 ZMJ was also contracted to provide on-site technical service for 60 days to aid in the installation of the longwall shields.\xa0 The shields were to be installed on the 17 East Longwall set-up face.The longwall shields were shipped to the Oak Grove Mine in October 2016 without yield valves and pressure gauges.\xa0 Those devices were to be installed once the shields were in place underground.\xa0 Each longwall shield is equipped with a pilot-operated check valve.\xa0 The purpose of the check valve is to allow the support cylinder to yield at a set pressure to prevent damage.Each leg support cylinder is equipped with a valve block containing protected ports and unprotected ports.\xa0 The protected ports have a pilot check valve. \xa0This check valve prevents hydraulic oil from leaving the leg support cylinder, which would cause sudden decompression of the leg cylinder, in the event of a component failure such as a broken hydraulic hose. \xa0The unprotected ports do not have a pilot check valve. \xa0If they are opened to the atmosphere, hydraulic oil will leave the leg support cylinder, and the leg support cylinder will decompress.\xa0 During normal operation, a yield valve and a pressure gauge are installed in the unprotected ports.\xa0 This allows some, but not all, hydraulic oil to escape in the event that the weight on the shield gets near the weight capacity limit, in order to prevent equipment failure of the shield.\xa0 The port plugs removed by Liang were on unprotected ports.\xa0 With plugs removed from unprotected ports on each leg support cylinder, the hydraulic system depressurized, causing the shield’s canopy to collapse (see the drawing in Appendix B).\xa0 MSHA Technical Support determined there were no defects in the design or function of longwall shield 171.\xa0Accident Site ObservationsThe accident occurred on the 17 East Longwall Panel set-up face.\xa0 The mine was in the process of installing longwall shields, starting from the tailgate side.\xa0 The longwall face was 1,000 feet wide, requiring a total of 186 shields.\xa0 Shields 186 through 95 had been positioned and the canopy (see the drawing in Appendix B) pressurized to allow the valves and gauges to be installed, but not placed against the roof.\xa0 The plugs, valves, and gauges lock into place by the insertion of a “U” shaped piece of metal that has two “legs,” commonly referred to as a staple.Prior to the accident, the mine personnel had installed yield valves and pressure gauges on shields 186 through 172 without incident. \xa0Shield 171, involved in the accident, was found in the following configuration:A ⅜ inch plug was found with one leg of the staple installed on the tailgate support cylinder.\nA ½ inch plug was found missing from the tailgate support cylinder.\nA ½ inch plug was found with one leg of the staple installed on the headgate support cylinder.\nThe plugs that were locked with one staple leg were the plugs quickly installed by the first responders to lift the shield off of the victim. \xa0This is consistent with witness statements.Work Experience and TrainingQian had 13 years of experience as a shield designer and engineer with ZMJ.\xa0 During an interview, Liang stated he (Liang) was the Sales Manager of the International Department of ZMJ. \xa0He received a university degree in English and was the only person at the mine who could speak both English and Mandarin.\xa0 All miners interviewed believed that his primary role was to translate for the victim.\xa0 The investigation team acquired a copy of Liang’s resume from the ZMJ U.S. distributor and it did not list any experience assembling longwall shields.The victim was the shield designer and technical expert sent by ZMJ to aid the mine in the installation of the new longwall shields, therefore, no 30 CFR § Part 48.7 task training was required for him.\xa0 However, Liang should have been tasked trained in the installation of the new longwall shields.\xa0 According to Liang, the victim directed him verbally to remove plugs from the support cylinders.MSHA 30 CFR § Part 48 requires all new miners to receive at least 40 hours of training prior to being assigned work duties in an underground coal mine.\xa0 Mine management provided MSHA with MSHA 5000-23 forms showing that the victim and Liang were given 32 hours of new miner training at the Oak Grove mine site from November 28, 2016 through December 1, 2016.\xa0 This training was provided by Bevill State Community College.\xa0 The additional eight hours of on-site training required by Part 48, prior to performing work duties, was not completed at the time of the accident on December 2, 2016.\xa0 Therefore, MSHA issued a noncontributory citation for a violation of 30 CFR § Part 48.5.Accident Events AnalysisBased on the interview with Liang and the investigation of the accident scene, the following events occurred. \xa0Liang was told by Qian to remove a ⅜ inch pipe plug from the tailgate side support leg cylinder in preparation for the installation of a pressure gauge. \xa0When he removed this plug, it depressurized the tailgate side support leg cylinder.\xa0 The tailgate side support leg cylinder was also found to have a ½ inch pipe plug removed where a yield valve was going to be installed. \xa0Liang was then told by Qian to remove a ½ inch plug in preparation for the installation of a yield valve.\xa0 The ½ inch pipe plug on the tailgate side cylinder had already been removed, so Liang removed the ½ inch plug from the headgate side support cylinder.\xa0 This caused the shield’s canopy to collapse. \xa0Therefore, Liang’s lack of practical knowledge of longwall shields is a root cause of the accident.\xa0 At least one plug removed from each cylinder will cause the shield to collapse.Work PracticesThe mine operator began placing shields underground and installing yield valves and gauges while the victim and Liang were going through the training class. \xa0During the investigation, the mine operator produced an email that explained the process that should be followed when installing yield valves and gauges on the longwall shields.\xa0 The process is as follows:Install tilt yield valves\nInstall support cylinder yield valves\nInstall yield valves on ram and base lift cylinders\nThe mine operator followed these procedures while installing the hydraulic components on shields 186 through 172 without any problem.\xa0 The ZMJ employees did not follow this procedure or follow standard maintenance practices.\xa0 If the ZMJ employees had installed the valves and gauges according to the procedure above, there would not have been a plug removed from two cylinders at the same time. \xa0Each cylinder would have had the valves and gauges installed before moving onto the next cylinder, as outlined by the procedure.The standard maintenance practice is only one support cylinder should be depressurized at a time when performing maintenance or installing hydraulic components. \xa0Additionally, no one is allowed past the support cylinders while maintenance is performed on either cylinder.\xa0 In extreme cases, should it be necessary to depressurize both support cylinders at the same time, the shield canopy would be blocked against motion, for example, with a four-point crib or a set of timbers. \xa0These standard practices were not followed during installation of hydraulic components on longwall shield 171.\xa0', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'An analysis was conducted to identify the basic causes of the accident, which could have been corrected through reasonable management controls.\xa0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have prevented the accident.Root Cause:\xa0 The contractor did not have an effective procedure to ensure persons working on longwall shields were properly task trained.\xa0 The contractor used the sales manager/translator as a maintenance assistant, but the translator was not trained in the task of installing the longwall shield.\xa0 He did not have practical knowledge of safe work procedures for the task and did not recognize the hazard created by depressurizing both support cylinders at the same time.\nCorrective Action: \xa0The contractor will ensure that all its personnel performing work in the mine are properly trained.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator and contractor did not have an effective procedure to ensure the longwall shield was blocked against motion at all times while work was performed in an area where the shield could collapse onto a miner.\xa0 Both of the support cylinders of the shield were depressurized while the victim was in the pinch point performing maintenance on the tilt cylinder.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator submitted a revision to the roof control plan that requires a 4-point wood crib to be installed to block the shield against motion while work of this type is performed.\xa0 MSHA approved this plan revision.\xa0 The operator and the contractor have retrained all longwall installation personnel on the proper procedure to block the longwall shield canopy when repair, maintenance, or installation of the longwall shield would cause both support cylinders to depressurize.', 'CONCLUSION': 'An engineer employed by a longwall shield manufacturer was fatally injured when a longwall shield collapsed onto him. \xa0The victim was installing hydraulic components on the tilt cylinder of longwall shield 171, while his coworker, whose primary job was as a translator, removed hydraulic components on both support cylinders without blocking the longwall shield canopy against motion.\xa0Approved

designer and engineer, and liang shengping, sales manager and translator for zhengzhou coal mining machinery (group) co. ltd (zmj), arrived at the mine’s north portal to prepare for their first day underground.  oak grove is the first mine in the united states to purchase longwall shields from the people’s republic of china.  around 7:00 a.m., qian and liang joined the mine’s longwall set-up crew and entered the mine using the service hoist.  at approximately 7:15 a.m., the crew boarded a rail mounted mantrip and traveled to the 17 east longwall panel.william bonner, longwall foreman, held a safety meeting with the longwall set-up crew.  donnie tisdale, general inside laborer, and brandon wright, longwall mechanic, were assigned to work with qian and liang.  while tisdale and wright gathered hand tools, qian and liang walked to the set-up face with jack rexrode, maintenance foreman.  rexrode asked qian to inspect the hydraulic components on longwall shields 186 through 172 that had been previously installed by oak grove employees.tisdale and wright arrived at the tailgate side of the set-up face and met with qian and liang.  the four men then walked to the headgate side of the set-up face and loaded hydraulic components on a battery-powered longwall shield hauler.  rexrode left to check on miners working at another location.  qian and liang returned to the tailgate side of the set-up face.  tisdale and wright took the longwall shield hauler around the back entry to the tailgate side of the set up face.  the four men unloaded the hydraulic components and placed them by the shields where they would be installed.  tisdale and wright took the shield hauler back to the headgate.  qian and liang walked to shield 171 (serial number 075) to begin installing hydraulic components.qian crawled behind the two support leg cylinders of shield 171 to install low flow yield valves on the tilt cylinder.  while qian was located in the pinch point, behind the support cylinders, he instructed liang to remove the ⅜ inch pipe plug from the tailgate side support cylinder, in preparation for the installation of a pressure gauge.  this action depressurized the tailgate side support leg cylinder and placed all of the weight of the shield canopy on the headgate side support leg cylinder. qian, still working on the tilt cylinder, instructed liang to remove a ½ inch pipe plug without specifying from which support cylinder.  liang removed the ½ inch plug from the headgate side support leg cylinder, which depressurized the cylinder, causing the shield to collapse. liang immediately called for help.  wayne ingle, longwall electrician, and grady robinson, longwall shearer operator, were working approximately 75 feet away and heard liang.  they could see that shield 171 had collapsed behind liang.  ingle, wright, and tisdale ran toward the tailgate while robinson ran to the headgate to get the hydraulic pump started to pressurize the shield.ingle attempted to communicate with the victim when he arrived at shield 171, but there was no response.robinson notified rexrode and the rest of the crew that a shield had collapsed.  he started the hydraulic pump which sent hydraulic fluid to the shield line.  bonner notified persons on the surface of the accident and rexrode and bonner went to the accident scene.upon arrival at the scene, rexrode manually activated the valve control, in an attempt to raise the collapsed shield.  oil flowed freely from the unplugged port on the tailgate support cylinder, preventing activation of the cylinder.  rexrode plugged this open port and again attempted to raise the shield.  this attempt also failed, as oil also flowed freely from the open port on the headgate side support cylinder.  rexrode then plugged the headgate side cylinder and the shield was successfully raised.  two wooden crib blocks were placed on the pan line to securely block the shield in position.matt miller, longwall stage loader operator and mine rescue/first aid team member, arrived at the scene.  miller checked the victim’s vital signs and found none.  the victim was placed on a stretcher and transported to the surface area of the mine.phillip russell, jefferson county deputy coroner, arrived at the mine site and pronounced the victim dead at 12:02 p.m.  an autopsy was performed by the jefferson county coroner/medical examiner office.  the cause of death was listed as mechanical asphyxia."

Pierce, District Manager\n\xa0\n\xa0OVERVIEWRichard Smith, a 58-year old Haul Truck Operator, was fatally injured on September 8, 2016.\xa0 The victim was operating a Caterpillar 773E haul truck and was returning to the pit for loading when the truck, traveling down a 9% grade, veered from the right to the left side of the haul road and traveled over the berm at the top of the highwall.\xa0 The truck landed upside down approximately 201 feet below.\xa0\xa0The accident occurred because the mine operator failed to ensure the victim maintained control of the truck and did not ensure seat belts were being used properly.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0GENERAL INFORMATIONHanson Aggregates Southeast, LLC, Neverson Quarry (Hanson) is a crushed granite operation located in Sims, Wilson County, North Carolina.\xa0 John Wakefield is the Plant Manager and Robert Grimes is the Plant Foreman.\xa0 The plant operates five days per week with one, ten- to twelve-hour shift per day.\xa0 There are a total of fifteen employees at this mine.\xa0Hanson drills and blasts granite from a multi-level bench, which is then loaded into haul trucks with a front-end loader. \xa0The material is delivered to on-site processing facilities and conveyed to stockpiles. \xa0The finished product is sold for use in construction.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on April 11, 2016.DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENTOn September 8, 2016, Richard Smith (victim) reported to work at 7:03 a.m. \xa0Smith reported to the shop to clock in and perform a preoperational inspection of his haul truck. \xa0Grimes was at the shop checking preoperational inspection records when Smith arrived.\xa0 That morning, there were three haul trucks and two front-end loaders in operation.\xa0 The three haul truck operators, Kenneth Lamn, Richie Coleman, and Smith, started to make their first round at approximately 7:30 a.m.\xa0 Otis Finch (Pit Loader Operator) conducted the daily work place exam and was working in the pit. \xa0Work progressed normally throughout the morning.At 1:45 p.m., Smith dumped his twenty-third load and was headed back to the pit for another. \xa0Danny Manning (Utility) was in the lower ramp sump area moving shot rock when he heard a loud boom and thought he had blown a tire. \xa0Manning turned around and saw rocks falling from the highwall and a large cloud of dust. \xa0When the dust cleared, Manning saw the haul truck upside down and immediately radioed that a truck had gone over the highwall. \xa0Wakefield radioed for everyone to stop where they were and instructed Cheryl Gilliam (Scale Operator) to call 911.\xa0 Emergency services were contacted at 1:48 p.m.Coleman stopped his loaded truck on level ground near the dump hopper and Grimes directed traffic.\xa0 Lamn remained in his truck and did not move it.\xa0 Manning went to the truck cab and did not see Smith inside.\xa0 Wakefield traveled to the scene and observed Smith's body on top of the upside down truck.Emergency services arrived at 1:58 p.m.\xa0 The Sims and Bailey Volunteer Fire Departments used a ladder truck to recover Smith, who was pronounced dead at the scene.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Measurements made during the investigation showed that Smith's haul truck traveled 655 feet down the pit ramp on a 9% grade, veered to the left and struck the approximately 5-foot high berm. The truck traveled approximately 64 feet along the top of the berm before rolling over the highwall.INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENTSafety and Health Manager, Bill Owens, notified MSHA of the accident at 2:01 p.m. on September 8, 2016, by a telephone call to the Department of Labor's National Contact Center (DOLNCC).\xa0 The DOLNCC contacted the MSHA Southeast District Office and an investigation was started the same day.\xa0 In order to facilitate a rescue effort, an order pursuant to Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977, was verbally issued to the mine operator.\xa0 This order was subsequently modified to a Section 103(k) order to ensure the safety of miners.\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0MSHA's accident investigation team conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, reviewed training documentation, and examined work procedures relevant to the accident.\xa0 MSHA Technical Support participated in the investigation to determine whether equipment defects or factors contributed to the accident.DISCUSSIONWeather\nThe weather at the time of the accident was clear with a temperature of 91 degrees Fahrenheit and light winds.\xa0 Weather was not considered to be a factor in the accident.\xa0Training and Experience\nThe victim had over twenty-three years of mining experience with over two years at this operation.\xa0 MSHA conducted an in-depth review of the victim's training records and determined that there were no contributory training deficiencies.General Truck Information\nThe truck involved in the accident was a Caterpillar Model 773E, rigid frame, off-road, 50-ton dump truck manufactured in 2006 and delivered in 2007.\xa0 The digital hour meter would not power on after the accident, but according to the Technical Support report, the truck had over 20,000 hours of operation.\xa0 The truck had a total gross weight rating of approximately 185,000 pounds with a 100,000-pound payload.The truck was powered by a Caterpillar Model 3412, 650 horsepower, 12-cylinder, turbocharged and aftercooled diesel engine.\xa0 The transmission had seven forward speeds, neutral, and one reverse speed.Brakes\nDamage sustained during the accident made it impossible to perform a complete functional brake system test and air pressure could not be supplied remotely to test the brakes.\xa0 Technical Support inspected the brake system components and did not find any defects that would have contributed to the accident.Seat Belt\nThe truck was equipped with a 3-point seat belt.\xa0 Dried dirt on the seat belt latch plate indicated that the seat belt had not been used recently.\xa0 The seat belt latched properly when tested.\xa0 The accident investigation team determined that the victim was ejected from the truck because he was not using the seat belt.Additionally, there were rags tied to the seat belt to prevent full retraction of the belt.\xa0 According to interviews and discussions held as part of the accident investigation, mine personnel used these rags for comfort by sliding them along the belt to keep the belt from constantly tightening.\xa0 Other mine vehicle seat belts were also equipped with these rags.ROOT CAUSE ANALYSISA root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified:Root Cause:\xa0The mine operator failed to ensure the victim maintained control of the equipment while in motion\nCorrective Action:\xa0The mine operator trained all employees regarding the dangers associated with operating equipment when tired, sleepy, and feeling ill.\xa0 Employees were made aware that they are able to take breaks when they are not feeling alert and are to notify management in such cases.Root Cause:\xa0The mine operator failed to ensure seat belts were being used properly.\nCorrective Action:\xa0The mine operator removed all rag modifications and trained all employees in using seat belts properly and in seat belt inspection and maintenance.CONCLUSIONAfter working without incident throughout the morning of September 8, the haul truck Richard Smith was operating, veered off the road, traveled over the berm and fell approximately 201 feet over the highwall.\xa0 Based on the findings of MSHA's investigation, there was no evidence of mechanical or equipment malfunction or defect. The victim failed to maintain control of the haul truck and failed to wear his seat belt.\xa0ENFORCEMENT ACTIONSOrder No. 8905873\xa0– issued September 8, 2016, pursuant to Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 (originally issued verbally and reduced to writing upon arrival of an inspector and subsequently modified to an order pursuant to Section 103(k)):An accident occurred at this operation on September 8, 2016, at approximately 1350 hours. As rescue and recovery work is necessary, this order is being issued, under Section 103(J) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, to assure the safety of all persons at this operation. This order is also being issued to prevent the destruction of any evidence which would assist in investigating the cause or causes of the accident. It prohibits all activity in the pit area from the top pit ramp to the bottom of bench #8 except to the extent necessary to rescue an individual or prevent or eliminate an imminent danger until MSHA has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in this area. This order applies to all person engaged in the rescue and recovery operation and any other person on-site. \xa0\xa0This order was initially issued orally to the mine operator at 1446 hour and is now reduced to writing.Citation No. 8816532\xa0– issued November 2, 2016, pursuant to Section 104(a) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 for a violation of 30 CFR § 56.9101:On September 8, 2016, a fatal accident occurred at this operation when a haul truck operator drifted across the haul road while traveling down a 9% grade. The haul truck made contact with the left side berm and rolled over a 201 foot highwall landing upside down in the pit below. The operator did not maintain control of the haul truck while traveling down the haulroad.\xa0Order No. 8816533\xa0– issued November 2, 2016, pursuant to Section 104(d)(1) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 for a violation of 30 CFR § 56.14131(a):On September 8, 2016, a fatal accident occurred at this operation when a haul truck operator drifted across the haul road while traveling down a 9% grade. The haul truck made contact with the left side berm and rolled over a 201 foot highwall landing upside down in the pit below. The haul truck operator was not wearing a seat belt and was ejected from the truck. Management engaged in aggravated conduct, constituting more than ordinary negligence by not ensuring the truck operators were wearing their seat belts and by not correcting the altered state of harnesses in the haul trucks.\xa0 This violation is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory standard.""}",

Lynn (age 59) was killed when rock from a highwall, approximately 80 feet above, fell on the operator\'s cab of the hydraulic excavator that he was operating.\nThe accident occurred because the operator\'s mining methods did not maintain wall stability where the victim was working. \xa0The operator failed to take down or support hazardous ground conditions before work commenced in the area and failed to identify hazardous ground conditions during examinations in the work area prior to work commencing.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0GENERAL INFORMATIONThe Vulcan Construction Materials, LLC (Vulcan) Savannah Quarry is a surface limestone mining operation located in Savannah, Hardin County, Tennessee.\xa0 The Plant Manager is Doug Britt and the Safety and Health Manager is Mike Junkerman.\xa0 The mine operates five days per week with one shift per day.\xa0 Shifts range from 10 to 14 hours in length.\xa0 The mine employs 13 people.\nThere is one active pit at the mine.\xa0 Vulcan drills and blasts (shoots) the limestone.\xa0 Excavators and front-end loaders load the resulting material into haul trucks for delivery to on-site processing facilities.\xa0 The mine produces aggregates, primarily for road construction, and agricultural lime.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on May 5, 2016.\xa0\xa0\xa0DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENTOn July 25, 2016, the operator held a 30-minute safety meeting with the miners beginning around 6:00 a.m.\xa0 Miners traveled to their respective work sites after the meeting.\xa0 James T. Lynn (victim), a 59-year old miner with over 17 years of experience, traveled to the active working pit area at the north end of the west highwall to operate a track-mounted, Caterpillar 345B excavator to segregate and load rock previously shot from the highwall.\xa0 At 7:00 a.m., he began loading rock into a Caterpillar 775D, haul truck operated by David Brown.\xa0The victim was operating the excavator on an elevated pad, or perch, constructed of older shot material near the highwall.\xa0 During the loading process and while waiting on the haul truck to return, the victim used the excavator to move large rocks out of the way so that smaller rock material could be loaded into the truck to haul to the rip-rap plant.\xa0 The rip-rap plant was located approximately 400 yards away from where the victim was working.At approximately 8:45 a.m., Brown heard a loud noise as he was hauling a load to the rip-rap plant.\xa0 He initially thought it was coming from loading rip-rap at the plant but did not see anyone in that direction.\xa0 Brown was concerned something had happened and tried to contact Lynn via CB radio.\xa0 Receiving no response, Brown traveled back to the excavator and saw large rocks on top of it and could not see the operator\'s cab.\xa0 The excavator was still running and hydraulic fluid was pouring out.\xa0 The cab side of the excavator was closest to the highwall with the rear of the excavator facing away from the highwall.\xa0 \xa0\xa0Ronnie Cagle, Heavy Equipment Operator, was using a front-end loader to load the hopper at the rip-rap plant and overheard Brown trying to contact the victim on the radio.\xa0 Brown thought the rock could be moved off the excavator with the front-end loader and asked Cagle to come quickly with it.\xa0 Cagle drove the front-end loader to the accident site and saw the rock on the excavator cab.\xa0 He realized there was no way to get to the victim and that the potential for additional rock movement presented a danger.\xa0\xa0Doug Britt was at the mine and overheard Brown calling to the victim over the radio.\xa0 Brown asked Britt to call 911.\xa0 Britt contacted emergency services at 8:48 a.m. and traveled to the accident site.\xa0 Emergency services started arriving at 9:00 a.m including Hardin County EMS, Hardin County Fire and Rescue, and the Hardin County Sheriff\'s Office.\xa0 An emergency response helicopter was also dispatched to the mine.Due to the condition of the cab and the location of the excavator in relation to the highwall, the mine operator used a Caterpillar D8 bulldozer to pull the excavator to a safe location to extricate the victim.\xa0 The operator used vise grips to clamp the fuel line to stop fuel flow and turn off the machine.\xa0 An EMT with Hardin County EMS could not feel a pulse and did not receive a response when asking the victim to respond.\xa0 The EMT report indicates that the victim ""expired on the impact of the boulders landing on the cab.""\xa0INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENTMike Junkerman notified MSHA of the accident at 9:03 a.m. CDST on July 25, 2016, by a telephone call to the Department of Labor\'s National Contact Center (DOLNCC).\xa0 The DOLNCC contacted David Allen, Safety Specialist, Southeast District. Junkerman was not at the mine when the accident occurred and reported to the DOLNCC that an excavator operator was trapped when rocks fell on top of the excavator.\xa0 MSHA initially considered this a rescue and recovery operation and verbally issued an order pursuant to Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977, as amended, by phone, prior to the arrival of an inspector.\xa0 Ed Jewell, Mine Safety and Health Inspector, arrived at the mine and reduced the Section 103(j) order to writing.\xa0 When he learned it was no longer a rescue and recovery operation, the inspector modified to a Section 103(k) order to ensure the safety of miners until an investigation could be conducted. \xa0\xa0\xa0MSHA\'s accident investigation team conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, reviewed training documentation, and examined work procedures relevant to the accident.\xa0 MSHA Technical Support participated in the investigation to help determine causal factors contributing to the accident and to make measurements using a calibrated, Laser Technology Impulse 200 range finder.\xa0 The investigation was conducted with the assistance of mine management.\xa0 There were no eye witnesses to the accident.DISCUSSIONWeather\nThe most recent measurable rainfall prior to the accident was 0.04-inch on July 16, 2016.\xa0 July 25, 2016 was hot and dry with a high temperature of 100º F.\xa0 Adverse weather did not play a part in the accident.Training and Experience\nThe victim had over 17 years of mining experience, 8 of which were at this mine.\xa0 A representative of MSHA\'s Educational Field and Small Mine Services staff conducted an in-depth review of the victim\'s training records. MSHA determined that there were no contributory training deficiencies.Geology\nThe mine produces aggregates from the Dixon, Lego, and Laurel limestone formations of the Wayne group in descending order. The Dixon formation is alternating layers of brown and green calcareous mudstone interbedded with limestone.\xa0 The Lego formation is composed of green and reddish brown limestone.\xa0 The Laurel formation is similar to the Lego formation.\xa0 There is one-foot thick Waldon shale between the Lego and Laurel formations.The formations in the quarry are highly jointed.\xa0 This creates a rugged highwall face, as shown in APPENDIX B, Photos 1, 2, and 3, and increases the likelihood of rockfalls.\xa0 The portion of the west wall at the accident site is nearly vertical with strike in the north to south direction.\xa0 The primary joint set in the accident area runs in the direction of N26°E.\xa0 Measurements indicate that the dip of the joint set was 88.6°, or nearly vertical.\xa0 One of the joint sets was traced to 48 feet on the top of the highwall and was visible in the north highwall 252 feet away as shown in APPENDIX B, Photo 4.\xa0 In addition, there were at least four additional joints parallel to the primary joint in an area 24 feet from the highwall face.\xa0 The spacing between the joints was as close as 13 feet.\xa0 The joints were visible and appeared tight well behind the highwall face, but were open as the joints got closer to the face.\xa0 A close-up view of a primary joint set near the highwall face is shown in APPENDIX B, Photo 5.Perch\nThe interviews revealed that the victim sometimes constructed a perch from the top of which he would load and separate materials.\xa0 The victim was operating the excavator on a perch that was approximately 7 feet high, 27 feet wide and 25 feet long.\xa0 The accident investigation team estimates that the top of the excavator cab was 19 feet above the pit floor.\xa0 The excavator was positioned on top of material left from a shot made on June 23, 2016.\xa0 The victim was loading and separating material shot on July 21, 2016.Highwall and Rockfall\nThe accident investigation team measured the highwall to be approximately 111 feet high from the pit floor to the top of the wall at the accident site.\xa0 The rockfall appears to have initiated at a height between 96 and 102 feet above the pit floor, approximately 80 feet above the excavator cab, and left a V shape cavity in wall.\xa0 The excavator was located near the highwall with the rear of the excavator facing away from the wall.\xa0 This placed the operator\'s cab directly adjacent to the highwall. \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0One piece of rock remaining on top of the excavator was examined.\xa0 This particular rock measured 3 feet high, 4 feet long, and 20 inches thick, and was calculated to weigh approximately 3,300 pounds.\xa0 The strata in this rock matched the strata at the V-shaped cavity in the highwall.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0As shown in Appendix B, Photo 1, an area adjacent to the excavator\'s location previously failed at some undetermined time.\xa0 Highwall material slid from a height of approximately 57 feet above the pit floor.\xa0 Such failures should be cause for further investigation as they are often indicative of instability.Mining Methods\nThe operator uses drilling and blasting to remove material from the highwall.\xa0 The standard shot-pattern is 19 feet by 21 feet with 6.5-inch holes.\xa0 Holes are drilled to a depth of 123 feet.\xa0 The mine does not use pre-splitting blasting methods.\xa0 Pre-splitting helps control back-break and maintain wall stability by controlling fragmentation.The direction of mining, in relation to the jointing, contributed to highwall instability due to the multiple planes of weakness present in the highwall strata at an acute angle to the face.\xa0 Blasting practices, in conjunction with the direction of mining relative to the joints, created a broken and blocky highwall susceptible to failures and rockfalls from a near-vertical face.\xa0The operator did not have equipment with sufficient reach and capability to scale the highwall at the mine.\xa0 Vulcan used an excavator to scale from the top of the highwall, but it only had the capability of scaling approximately 27 feet from the top, leaving a sizable portion of the highwall face that could not be scaled due to its height.\xa0Where loose highwall material could not be scaled, the common practice at the mine was to construct barricades using previously shot material to prevent persons from entering the hazardous area.\xa0 In such cases, active mining would move to another location until the highwall could be shot again at some time in the future to remove the hazardous conditions.\xa0 At the time of the accident, nearly the entire interior perimeter of the pit was barricaded to prevent exposure to hazardous highwall conditions.\xa0 The only location where a barricade was not present was at the active working location.\xa0 At the time of the accident, the excavator was positioned on a perch constructed of material from a previous shot, which would typically be material used to construct a barrier to prevent entry into a hazardous area.\xa0\xa0Ground Conditions\nAccident investigators observed broken, loose, and hanging rock and multiple joints on the highwall. \xa0\xa0They also observed loose material ""dribble"" off the highwall in areas near the accident site on at least two occasions while investigators were present.\xa0 These conditions were present throughout the pit. \xa0The operator had not taken down or supported the loose ground before work commenced in the area.\xa0 The active working area was not posted with a warning against entry and there was no barrier to impede entry to the area.Examinations\xa0\xa0\nUnder Vulcan policy, each miner was designated to conduct examinations of their respective work areas.\xa0 This included examinations of ground conditions where work was to be performed prior to work commencing.\xa0 Miners made records of their examinations daily.\xa0 There were no records indicating hazardous highwall conditions prior to the accident.\xa0 The examination of ground conditions at the accident site area for July 25, 2016, either had not been recorded or could not be located following the accident.\xa0The broken, loose, and hanging rock and multiple joints were obvious from the pit floor.\xa0 The extent of these conditions was even more obvious when viewed from the top of the highwall.\xa0 The joints were clearly visible and displayed signs of separation as they neared the edge of the highwall.\xa0 Due to curvature in the highwall, the broken, loose, and hanging rock materials were clearly visible when viewing the active highwall area from the side as shown in Appendix B, Photo 3.\xa0 Examinations from the top of the highwall (as shown in Appendix B, Photo 4 & 5) were not a routine part of the miners\' examinations of ground conditions before work commenced below.\xa0 Prudent examinations of highwall ground conditions include observations from multiple vantage points to ensure hazardous conditions are identified and corrected before miners are exposed to them.\xa0ROOT CAUSE ANALYSISA root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified:Root Cause:\xa0The operator\'s mining methods did not maintain wall stability in places where persons work or travel.\n\xa0Corrective Action:\xa0The operator has revised their mining methods to alter the mining direction with respect to jointing and has revised the shot pattern to reduce back-break.\xa0\xa0Root Cause: The operator failed to take down or support hazardous ground conditions before work commenced in the area.\n\xa0Corrective Action: The operator has instituted and trained all employees in a plan for taking down hazardous ground conditions with equipment that can reach all areas of the highwall face.Root Cause: The operator failed to conduct an adequate workplace examination. The operator failed to identify hazardous ground conditions in the work area prior to work commencing.\n\xa0Corrective Action: The mine has instituted written highwall inspection procedures which include conducting examinations from the top of the highwall before work commences.\xa0 All miners have been trained in these inspection procedures.\xa0CONCLUSIONThe accident occurred because Vulcan\'s mining methods did not maintain wall stability where the victim was working.\xa0 The operator failed to take down or support hazardous ground conditions before work commenced in the area, and failed to identify hazardous ground conditions during workplace examinations prior to work commencing.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0ENFORCEMENT ACTIONSOrder No. 8818895\xa0– issued July 25, 2016, pursuant to Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 (originally issued verbally and reduced to writing upon arrival of an inspector and subsequently modified to an order pursuant to Section 103(k)):An accident occurred at this operation on 07/25/2016 at approximately 0845.\xa0 As rescue and recovery work is necessary, this order is being issued under Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 to assure the safety of all persons at the operation.\xa0 This order is also being issued to prevent the destruction of any evidence which would assist in investigating the cause or causes of the accident.\xa0 It prohibits all activity at the mine\'s pit area until MSHA has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in this area.\xa0 This order applies to all persons engaged in the rescue and recovery operation and any other persons on-site.\xa0 This order was initially issued orally to the mine operator at 0940 and has now been reduced to writing.Subsequent Action No. 8818895-01\xa0– issued July 25, 2016, to modify the original 103(j) order to an order pursuant to Section 103(k) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977Citation No. 8904016\xa0– issued August 11, 2016, pursuant to Section 104(d)(1) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 for a violation of 30 CFR § 56.3130:Failure to maintain wall stability contributed to a fatal accident that occurred at this mine on 25 July, 2016, when the cab of a track-mounted excavator was crushed by a fall of material from the quarry highwall.\xa0 The excavator was being used to sort and selectively load blasted rock into a haul truck, and was working from an elevated position constructed from the remnants of a previous shot adjacent to the quarry wall.The quarry face intersects strong Geologic jointing at an acute angle.\xa0 The jointing is pervasive vertically and extensive laterally.\xa0 This condition contributes to a highly-fractured quarry wall by creating multiple planes of weakness in the rock strata.\xa0 This resulted in obvious and extensive broken, loose and hanging rock on the wall.\xa0 The operator did not employ benching, nor did the operator provide any equipment on-site with sufficient reach and capability to scale the quarry wall (the highwall is 111ft high, excavator has 40ft max horizontal, 27ft vertical downward, and 35ft vertical upward reaches).\xa0 There were no signs or barricades in place to prevent the excavator from entering an area where hazardous conditions existed.Management engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence by failing to use mining methods that maintain wall stability.\xa0 This violation is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory health and safety standard.Order No. 8904017\xa0– issued August 11, 2016, pursuant to Section 104(d)(1) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 for a violation of 30 CFR § 56.3200:Failure to correct loose ground conditions on the quarry wall contributed to a fatal accident that occurred at this mine on 25 July, 2016, when the cab of a track-mounted excavator was crushed by several large boulders.\xa0 One of the boulders measured in excess of 3000lbs, and fell from approximately 80ft above the excavator cab.\xa0 The excavator was being used to sort and selectively load blasted rock into a haul truck, and was working from an elevated position constructed from remnants of a previous shot adjacent to the quarry wall.\xa0 When the excavator was repositioned along the quarry wall in the course of the operator\'s tasks, it was struck by material falling from the highly-fractured quarry face.\xa0Management engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence by failing to take down or support loose ground and post warnings or barricade the area against entry.\xa0 This violation is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory health and safety standard.Order No. 8904018\xa0– issued August 11, 2016, pursuant to Section 104(d)(1) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 for a violation of 30 CFR § 56.3401:Failure to conduct an adequate examination utilizing multiple vantage points of the quarry wall contributed to a fatal accident that occurred at this mine on 25 July, 2016.\xa0 The cab of a track-mounted excavator was crushed by a fall of material from the quarry highwall.\xa0 The excavator was being used to sort and selectively load blasted rock into a haul truck, and was working from an elevated position constructed from the remnants of a previous shot adjacent to the quarry wall.\xa0 An examination of the quarry wall was not adequately conducted to identify hazardous ground conditions prior to the excavator being placed near the highly-fractured quarry wall where broken, loose and hanging rock was obvious and extensive.Management engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence by failing to ensure exams are adequately conducted to identify hazardous loose ground conditions.\xa0 This violation is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory health and safety standard.'}",

The crane then began the process of rigging and lifting the equipment.\xa0 Crane crews worked through the day to attempt to remove the equipment.On June 5, rescue workers determined there was too much material in the pit and efforts to pull the buried equipment with the crane stopped.\xa0 The operator decided to pump the material from the pit.\xa0 The plan would use onsite pumps, hoses, and pipes in an attempt to pump mud from the flooded pit to another impoundment onsite away from the accident location. Later that same day, the operator decided to not utilize the pumping equipment onsite and decided to bring in other pumps and equipment and personnel to perform the work.\xa0On June 6, additional pumps and crews arrived and began running the pumps.\xa0 Pumping uncovered a fair portion of the equipment and on June 7, a long reach excavator arrived onsite and was used in combination with the pumping to uncover the top of the cab of the haul truck. Upon reaching the cab, search and rescue teams assisted in the search and possibly recovery of the victims.\xa0 The search and rescue teams were able to cut and remove the top of the haul unit cab. Teams began digging by hand to make entry into the cab and search for Mr. Shorter. The entire cab was cleared but they were unable to locate Shorter.\xa0On June 8, rescue workers continued using the pumps to lower the material and locate the other known miner's location, the cab of the excavator. Rescue workers located the cab of the excavator around 3:00 p.m. and at approximately 10:00 p.m. that evening Mr. Hemphill was located in the cab of the excavator.\xa0 On June 9, Mr. Hemphill's body was recovered at 6:56 a.m.Pumping continued on June 9 and 10 to remove more material from around the machines in an attempt to locate Mr. Shorter.\xa0 Rescue crews used ground penetrating radar and cadaver dogs on June 10 to locate Mr. Shorter. The use of radar was unsuccessful given the material that had flooded the pit location.\xa0 Crews continued to wash and pump material in the area of the truck and were able to locate Mr. Shorter at approximately 10:00 p.m. on June 10.\xa0 At approximately 1:30 a.m. on June 11, MSHA, the state search and rescue team and county officials developed a recovery plan and at approximately 7:00 a.m., workers were able to recover Mr. Shorter and remove him from the pit."", 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': ""On June 20, 2016, MSHA's accident investigation team traveled to the mine to conduct a physical inspection of the accident scene, interview employees, and review documents and work procedures relevant to the accident.

The principal operating official is Rick Sears, Plant Manager. The limestone is drilled and blasted at this operation. Shot rock is then transported by truck to the primary plant where it is crushed, sized and stockpiled. The finished product is sold for use in the construction trades. The mine employs approximately fifteen persons and operates a ten-hour shift, five days per week. \xa0Martin Marietta contracted Wendling Quarries Inc.

(Jerico) was the blasting contractor at the site and was responsible for handling, loading and detonating explosives.At the time of the accident, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) was conducting a regular mandated safety inspection of the mine.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On March 21, 2016, the day before the accident, Wendling began drilling a blast hole pattern previously laid out by Martin Marietta employees, Tracy Hockemeier and David Norman, Assistant Plant Manager. \xa0Wendling completed the drilling on the day of the accident, March 22nd. \xa0Due to water levels at the mine, Martin Marietta ran a de-watering pump to a nearby pond each day as drilling was performed.On the day of the accident, Hockemeier reported to work at approximately 6:30 a.m., his normal starting time. Hockemeier met with Norman to discuss the day’s events and then proceeded to the shop to supervise a crew doing plant maintenance work.\xa0 Around 12:25 p.m., Norman received a call from Danielle Fiorini, Scale Clerk, asking him to come to the scale house. \xa0Upon arrival, he discovered Christopher Willett, MSHA Inspector, had arrived to conduct a regular safety inspection of the mine. \xa0Norman accompanied Willett on his inspection.At approximately 1:05 p.m., Jerico arrived at the mine to load the drill holes. \xa0Hockemeier met with Jerico employees Brent Edgington, Lead Blaster, and Logan Edgington and Jarod Nehring, Blaster’s Helpers.\xa0 After their on-site mine training, the Jerico employees proceeded to the Winterset section of the quarry to view the blast layout. \xa0When attempting to access the blast site, B. Edgington discovered access was impassable for the explosives trucks due to muddy conditions.At approximately 2:00 p.m., Hockemeier coordinated efforts to improve access for the explosives trucks. \xa0During this time, he discussed the general layout of the shot with B. Edgington. \xa0B. Edgington stated during the interview process, that when they entered the drilled out blast site, he recognized that there were unloadable holes.

Barnes was found inside the railcar by a co-worker, unresponsive.The accident occurred due to management's failure to properly train railcar washers in the health and safety aspects of their job. Management failed to prevent a railcar washer from being exposed to an atmosphere that was below the minimal oxygen content of 18%. Management failed to conduct exposure monitoring to determine the adequacy of control measures. Management failed to have a second miner available with backup equipment and rescue capability in the event of failure of the respiratory equipment. Finally, management failed to have a second person tend a lifeline when a miner was entering a tank.\xa0"", 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'Thiele Kaolin Company is a kaolin processing facility located in Sandersville, Washington County, Georgia. Eric Tillirson is President and Greg Frazier is Manager of Safety. The plant operates four twelve hour shifts, seven days a week. There are a total of 314 employees at this facility.Kaolin is initially processed at the mine facilities and then pumped into the plant thru pipelines for further processing. The kaolin material is classified according to particle size and brightness enhanced through chemical and mechanical means and then filtered using rotary vacuum filters to produce the final product. The finished product is then spray dried, made into slurry, or calcined. The finished product is shipped by railroad tank cars, tank trucks, hopper cars, or bags. Thiele contracts CVB Industrial Contracting, Inc. (CVB) to conduct various tasks at the plant, including bagging kaolin and washing railcars.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on June 25, 2015.', 'DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On the day of the accident, July 15, 2015, Travis Barnes (victim), contract employee with CVB, reported to work at approximately 6 a.m. his normal starting time. Barnes first reported to the track shed. At 6:05 a.m., Barnes and Tony Butts, both car washers for CVB, left the track shed to start sealing loaded railcars to prepare for shipment. At approximately 6:40 a.m., Barnes went back to the track shed to complete paperwork, wait for the train to pull out the loaded railcars and spot the empty railcars in the wash area of the plant. At 7:30 a.m., the train arrived to pull out the loaded cars but did not have any empty cars to leave. The train did not return with the empty cars until 10 a.m.At that time, the car washers left the track shed to go and wash the empty cars. Jim Dunn, Thiele Track Supervisor, saw Barnes at approximately 11:00 a.m., preparing to move five cars down the track to the washing area. Barnes was seen again on top of the accident car on track #2 by Antonio Watts, Thiele car washer, who had been on the adjacent track #3 washing cars. Watts went to track #6 to talk to Terry Gilmore, Track Leadman with Thiele. When Watts returned to the wash area, he noticed that Barnes had not started to wash the railcar. Watts was concerned that Barnes was inside the railcar longer than usual. Watts then climbed the railcar access ladder to check on Barnes. Watts saw Barnes was inside the railcar unresponsive. Barnes was not equipped with a lifeline and there was not a second person present. Watts called Dunn, who was off site at lunch. Dunn called Ronnie Adams, Production Foreman, and told him to call 911.Emergency services were called at 12:06 p.m. Willie Durden, Thiele employee and volunteer fireman, was working at the plant and received the call on his fire pager at 12:08 p.m. Durden was the first on the scene and immediately entered the railcar. Police and EMS arrived right after Durden. A rope was dropped into the railcar and Durden hooked it to Barnes’ fall protection harness. Barnes was lifted out of the railcar and CPR was immediately started. Barnes was transported by ambulance to Washington County Regional Medical Center where he was pronounced dead by E. K. May, Washington County Coroner. The cause of death was attributed to environmental suffocation.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'Trey Turner, CVB Industrial Contracting EHS Manager, notified MSHA of the accident at 12:23 p.m. July 15, 2015, by calling the Department of Labor’s National Contact Center (DOLNCC). The DOLNCC notified Judith Etterer, Staff Assistant, and an investigation was started the same day. In order to ensure the safety of all persons, MSHA issued a 103(j) order and later modified to section 103(k) of the Mine Act when the first Authorized Representative arrived at the mine. MSHA’s accident investigation team traveled to the mine and conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, conducted air sampling and reviewed training and work procedures relevant to the accident. MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine and contract management and employees.', 'PHYSICAL FACTORS': 'ACCIDENT DESCRIPTION:On July 15, 2015, a fatality occurred at Theile Kaolin Company’s (Thiele) Main Processing Plant in Sandersville, Georgia. The victim, a 25 year-old male, was found unresponsive inside of an empty rail tank car (GATX 22394) that transported a kaolin slurry product to a Chempak Transload Facility (Chempak) in Pennsylvania. The railcar initially shipped from Thiele on June 1, 2015, was off-loaded at Chempak on July 6, 2015, and arrived back at Thiele on the morning of the accident.The victim was preparing to wash residual slurry product out of Railcar GATX 22394, his first railcar of the day. The victim entered the railcar through the manway and climbed approximately 10 feet down an access ladder. The victim was later found unresponsive at the bottom of the car (Appendix A, Figures A1-A4). As shown in Figures A3 and A4, the victim’s railcar did not contain much residual product upon its return to Thiele.The victim was found wearing a full-face chemical cartridge respirator with organic vapor/acid gas cartridges. A Thiele RKI GX-2009 Portable Gas Monitor and Vertex Standard radio were also found on the victim. A fall protection harness was worn by the victim without a lanyard. Based on interviews, it is believed that the victim was alone in the railcar for at least 45-60 minutes before he was discovered. There was no evidence that the victim started washing the railcar, indicating that he may have been quickly incapacitated following entry. Data files obtained from the victim’s monitor revealed that the monitor was never turned on the day of the accident.A Thiele employee entered the victim’s railcar for approximately 20 minutes to assist in the extrication of the victim via a lifeline. Upon removing the victim from the railcar, a Thiele RKI GX-2009 monitor was placed at the top of the manway. The oxygen concentration at the opening was reported to be approximately 16.7%. During interviews, it was determined that the Thiele employee who assisted with the rescue did not test the air quality inside of the railcar prior to entry.RKI GX-2009 DATA ANALYSIS:Troy Hart, Industrial Hygienist, Physical and Toxic Agents Division, PS&HTC, Denver, CO conducted an analysis of data recovered from five Thiele RKI GX-2009 monitors. Data from the five instruments, along with additional details from the investigators, is provided in Appendix C.PRODUCT DESCRIPTION AND LOADING/UNLOADING PROCESSThiele manufactures various kaolin slurry mixtures that are shipped via railcar to customers. The product transported in the victim’s railcar was Kaogloss Plus, a kaolin slurry product manufactured for the PaperWorks paper mill in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Bulk samples of the slurry transported in the victim’s railcar were obtained from Thiele’s on-site production laboratory. The product did not have a noticeable odor.Kaolin slurry products may be held in railcars up to 30 days prior to being off-loaded; therefore, a low dose biocide (i.e., Thione) is routinely added to prevent bacteria growth. The active dose of Thione in Kaogloss Plus is approximately 70 parts per million. Methyl isothiocyanate (MITC), methylamine, and carbon disulfide are potential decomposition products of Thione. Approximately 7 pounds of xanthan gum is added to each Kaogloss Plus railcar to prevent the kaolin from settling. All slurry additives are well below the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) reporting threshold of 1%. Chemical concentrations above 1% are required to be reported on the SDS.In January 2015, PaperWorks began using Chempak to off-load the kaolin slurry from railcars into tank trucks for delivery to the paper mill in Essington, Pennsylvania. This was due to a weight limit on a railway bridge, which prevented Thiele railcars from shipping at full capacity to the PaperWorks paper mill. During the off-loading process, railcars are pressurized to convey the slurry into tank trucks via transfer lines. According to a Thiele representative, plant air and nitrogen are used at the Chempak facility; however, only compressor-supplied plant air is used during the off-loading of kaolin slurry.Thiele’s railcar wash crew employees are responsible for cleaning empty railcars that have been returned to the facility. The wash crew consists of three CVB contract employees and two Thiele employees. From the statements provided by the wash crew the following work practice was in place: Prior to cleaning a railcar, a relief valve is opened to relieve pressure from the car. A bottom drain plug is opened to drain residual product from the car. A 20 inch diameter railcar manway cover is opened using a wrench. Upon opening the manway, an RKI GX-2009 Portable Gas Monitor is used to check the railcar’s atmosphere. The monitor is equipped with sensors for oxygen (O2), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and combustible gas (LEL). A rubber band is attached to the monitor clip and the monitor is lowered into the car at arm’s length. Following the air quality check, the manway seal and hole are hosed off. The bottom of the car is also hosed to clear a spot for the wash crew employee to stand. An access ladder is placed on the manway hole and the employee climbs into the railcar. Mechanical ventilation is not used during the cleaning process. According to CVB management, washing facilitates the movement of atmospheric air into the railcar.SAMPLING PROCEDURES AND METHODSDuring the investigation, MSHA conducted air monitoring inside of the victim’s railcar and in seven empty and pressurized kaolin slurry railcars that were returned to Thiele. Four of the seven railcars had been off-loaded at Chempak, while the other three railcars were unloaded at customer locations. A summary of monitoring conducted in each railcar is provided at the end of this section in Table 2.Industrial Scientific iBRID™ multi-gas monitors with integral sampling pumps were used to sample the atmosphere inside of each railcar. The iBRIDs were fully calibrated prior to use and were configured to monitor O2, CO, carbon dioxide (CO2), H2S, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Prior to opening the railcar manway cover, the detectors were placed at the top relief valve to monitor the air relieved from the car. Immediately after the manway was opened, the detectors were placed at arm’s length in the manway opening. Remote monitoring was conducted inside of each railcar via a Tygon sampling line connected to the pump inlet of each iBRID. Monitoring was conducted near the bottom of each railcar and at breathing zone height (BZH) for at least 60 minutes. The average concentration of each gas over a ten second period was recorded on each monitor.If an oxygen deficient atmosphere was detected inside of a railcar, air from the railcar was collected into SKC FlexFoil® 1 liter bags using an SKC sampling pump and Tygon® sample line. Prior to sample collection, the sampling line was purged with air from the railcar for approximately 10 minutes. Additionally, each sample bag was filled and purged three times. Some air samples were also collected into 50 mL glass sample bottles. Gas chromatography analysis of the sample bags and bottles was conducted by the Pittsburgh Safety and Heath Technology Center’s (PS&HTC) Physical and Toxic Agents Division.Sorbent tube sampling was conducted by MSHA for organic vapors, MITC, methylamine, and carbon disulfide in the victim’s railcar (GATX 22394) and inside of railcar GATX 29235. Air samples were collected onto sorbent tubes attached to calibrated SKC low flow sampling pumps. MITC samples were collected at a flow rate of 100 cubic centimeters per minute (cc/min) onto charcoal tubes and analyzed in accordance with OSHA Method ID 7. Methylamine samples were collected at a flow rate of 200cc/min onto XAD-7 tubes and analyzed in accordance with a modified OSHA Method ID 40. Carbon disulfide samples were collected at a flow rate of 200cc/min onto charcoal tubes and analyzed in accordance with NIOSH Sampling and Analytical Method 1622 Draft. Organic vapor samples were collected at flow rate of 100cc/min onto charcoal tubes and analyzed in accordance with MSHA Method P-30.Each sampling train was pre-calibrated with a Bios Defender® primary calibrator using representative sample media in-line. The ends of the sorbent tubes were opened and attached to each sampling train at the beginning of the sampling period and immediately capped at the completion of sampling. A post flow-rate check was conducted at sampling completion. Samples were refrigerated and shipped overnight to the laboratory. MITC, methylamine, and carbon disulfide samples were submitted for analysis to TestAmerica, an American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) accredited laboratory. Organic vapor samples were submitted for analysis to the PS&HTC’s AIHA-accredited Organics Laboratory in the Physical and Toxic Agents Division.To determine if heat was a potential contributing factor to the fatality, a QuestTemp™ 34 wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) monitoring device was lowered into railcar GATX 29235 to monitor temperature and humidity inside of the car. The instrument remained inside of the railcar for approximately one hour.SAMPLING RESULTSSampling results are discussed in this section and presented in Tables 3 and 4 below. Additionally, iBRID monitoring graphs are provided in Appendix B for the oxygen-deficient railcars.On July 21, the oxygen concentration inside of the victim’s railcar (GATX 22394) was 20.9%. No hazardous gases or other contaminants were detected inside of the car. A hazardous atmosphere was not anticipated inside of the victim’s railcar since the manway had remained opened following the incident on July 15.On July 21, MSHA detected an oxygen-deficient environment inside of railcar GATX 29235 immediately upon opening the manway using an iBRID and a Thiele RKI GX-2009 monitor. The oxygen concentration ranged from 4-5% after the sampling line was dropped into the bottom of the car around 12:03 p.m. The sample line remained inside of the railcar until approximately 13:15 p.m., at which time the oxygen concentration was approximately 15% (Appendix B, Figure B1). Gas chromatography analysis of two air samples collected from the railcar confirmed a low oxygen and high nitrogen atmosphere inside the railcar. The first bag sample was collected at 12:35 p.m. and had an oxygen concentration of 14.8% and a nitrogen concentration of 84.2% (Table 4). The average WBGT was 92.3ºF inside of railcar GATX 29235. Note: The average temperature on July 21, 2015, was 87ºF. The average temperature on July 15, 2015, was 83.1ºF.On July 22, monitoring was conducted in three railcars that were unloaded at customer locations (UTLX 300465, GATX 64799, and ACFX 72913). Oxygen was within normal range and no hazardous gases or compounds were detected inside of these railcars.On July 24, monitoring was conducted inside railcar ACFX 79198. Immediately upon opening the manway, an oxygen-deficient environment was detected on two different iBRIDs and a Thiele RKI GX-2009 monitor. The oxygen concentration in the car ranged from 6-7% at 11:14 a.m. to 15% at 12:32 p.m. (Appendix B, Figures B2 and B3). Gas chromatography analysis of four air samples collected from the railcar confirmed a low oxygen, high nitrogen atmosphere inside of the railcar. The first bag sample was collected at 11:22 a.m. and had an oxygen concentration of 7.8% and a nitrogen concentration of 91.2% (Table 4).On July 29, atmospheric monitoring was conducted inside railcar UTLX 300466. Immediately upon opening the manway, an oxygen-deficient environment was detected on two iBRID monitors and on a Thiele MSA Altair multi-gas monitor. The oxygen concentration in the car ranged from 7-8% at 15:24 to 16-17% at 16:36 on two different iBRID monitors (Appendix B, Figures B4 and B5). Gas chromatography analysis of six air samples collected from the railcar confirmed a low oxygen, high nitrogen atmosphere inside of the railcar. An air sample was collected in a bottle at the manway when it was opened at 15:22. The sample had an oxygen concentration of 10.9% and a nitrogen concentration of 88.0%. The first bag sample was collected inside of the car at 15:42 and had an oxygen concentration of 9.8% and a nitrogen concentration of 89.1% (Table 4).On July 30, atmospheric monitoring was conducted inside railcar UTLX 300467. Immediately upon opening the manway cover, an oxygen-deficient environment was detected on an iBRID monitor and a Thiele MSA Altair monitor. The oxygen concentration ranged from 3% at 10:11 a.m. to 20% at 16:28 (Appendix B, Figures B6 and B7). Gas chromatography analysis of nine air samples collected from the railcar confirmed a low oxygen, high nitrogen atmosphere inside the railcar. An air sample was collected in a bottle at the manway when it was opened at 10:10 a.m. The sample had an oxygen concentration of 3.3% and a nitrogen concentration of 95.6%. The first bag sample was collected inside of the car at 10:25 a.m. and had an oxygen concentration of 4.6% and a nitrogen concentration of 94.5%.', 'DISCUSSION': 'American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z88.2-2015, Practices for Respiratory Protection, defines an Oxygen-Deficiency (Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health) as less than 16% oxygen at sea level.Atmospheric air contains approximately 78.0% nitrogen and 20.9% oxygen. If the nitrogen concentration is too high, it displaces the oxygen and asphyxiation can occur. Nitrogen is safe to breathe only when it is mixed with the appropriate amount of oxygen. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers to maintain workplace oxygen levels between 19.5 and 23.5%. As shown in Table 5, the human body is adversely affected by low concentrations of oxygen. An atmosphere of only 4-6% oxygen causes a victim to fall into a coma in less than 40 seconds. Oxygen must be administered within minutes to offer a chance of survival.The testing of an atmosphere is a key element in any confined space entry. Adequate monitoring primarily involves the following: properly calibrated instruments, employee task training, representative monitoring, and proper interpretation of the results. The number of sensor and battery failures, infrequent calibrations, and general calibration problems indicate that Thiele’s GX-2009 instrument calibration and maintenance program was inadequate. Thiele had only one instrumentician responsible for the calibration and maintenance of the facility’s monitors, Rogers Anderson, Corporate Maintenance Manager. No other Thiele or CVB employees were trained on maintenance or calibration of the monitors. Anderson indicated during interviews with MSHA, that the GX-2009 monitors were being phased out due to numerous problems with oxygen sensor failures.A significant number of alarms and warnings were recorded by the GX-2009 monitors.\xa0 There is a potential for employees to disregard alarms and warnings that frequently occur.\xa0 MSHA’s technical support staff analyzed the data that was recorded and stored in the internal memory of the victim’s monitor. The victim’s monitor had the highest number of alarms and warnings.\xa0 Oxygen warnings (<19.5%) were the most prevalent.\xa0 A significant number of oxygen alarms (>23.5%) were also observed which indicates that the monitor was improperly zeroed in contaminated air that contained less than 20.9% oxygen.\xa0During the investigation, numerous respiratory protection deficiencies were observed.\xa0 Thiele and CVB wash crew employees were provided full-face chemical cartridge respirators.\xa0 Thiele and CVB did not have respiratory protection procedures in place to address employee medical clearance, fit testing, respirator maintenance, and cartridge replacement.\xa0 Several dirty respirators were observed lying around and hanging inside of the track shed lockers.\xa0 The respirators and organic vapor/acid gas cartridges were observed with kaolin slurry splatter.\xa0 Thiele and CVB employees were observed with significant facial hair and none of the employees had been fit tested or given medical clearance to wear a respirator.\xa0 Additionally, employees had not been provided with replacement cartridges.\xa0 Based on the observed condition of the respirator cartridges, breathing would have been significantly restricted when employees wore their respirators.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\n\xa0WEATHERThe weather condition around the time of the accident was clear with a temperature of 87 degrees Fahrenheit and light winds.\xa0 Weather was not considered to be a factor in the accident.SUMMARYDuring the investigation, direct-read monitoring and gas chromatography analysis of air samples confirmed the presence of an oxygen-deficient environment inside of four railcars that had been off-loaded at the Chempak facility. Chempak uses plant air and nitrogen at the facility; however only compressor-supplied plant air is used during the off-loading of kaolin slurry at this site. Other compounds were detected during monitoring; however, those compounds were not detected at concentrations considered immediately Dangerous to Life and Health.\xa0Oxygen-deficient environments can be easily detected through the use of portable gas detectors.\xa0 Analysis of data recovered from the victim’s GX-2009 monitor indicated that the monitor was not turned on when the victim entered the railcar.\xa0 Further analysis of data from the victim’s monitor, as well as four other Thiele-owned RKI GX-2009 monitors, revealed numerous problems including: battery and sensor failures, infrequent calibration, no bump testing, and numerous alarms and warnings.\xa0 The victim’s monitor had the highest number of oxygen sensor failures and oxygen alarms/warnings.\xa0 At the time of the incident, the victim’s monitor had a bad oxygen sensor that indicated it failed on July 7, 2015 and had not been replaced.\xa0Thiele was aware of the numerous oxygen sensor failures and problems encountered with the GX-2009 monitors.\xa0 The victim either forgot to turn the monitor on or intentionally chose to keep the monitor turned off due to the frequency and aggravation of the alarms.\xa0 Either way, the victim had not been trained on the importance of air monitoring prior to entering a railcar.\xa0 Appropriate maintenance of Thiele’s gas monitors and training of personnel on confined space monitoring procedures would have prevented this fatality.Training and ExperienceTravis Barnes, victim, had 6 months mining experience all at this facility.\xa0 Thiele employees were responsible for conducting the contractor’s task training.\xa0 A representative of MSHA’s Educational Field Services staff conducted an in-depth review of the contractor’s training records.\xa0 Although the training records documented that task training had been conducted, it was determined by the investigative team that the training was not adequate.\xa0 Barnes and four other contract car washers were not trained on the health and safety aspects of their job.\xa0 During the interviewing process, it was discovered that the persons responsible for air monitor training, Jim Dunn and Terry Gilmore, could not verify they had conducted the training.\xa0 When asked, Gilmore said Dunn does the training and when Dunn was asked, he said Gilmore did the training and he gave an overview of the subject.\xa0 As an example of the lack of training, the employees each day were to check off on a sheet of paper that they monitored the air for H2S, however the sheet mistakenly said H2G.\xa0 MSHA’s interviews revealed that no one knew what H2G was and were not aware it was supposed to be H2S, including Gilmore and Dunn. \xa0The employees stated that the only training they received was that they were to stick the monitor in the railcar and write down what it recorded and that no one ever told them what potential hazards could be associated with the gases they were to monitor.\xa0\xa0\xa0 MSHA issued a noncontributory 104(g)(1) Order.\xa0 Four miners were withdrawn until the required training was provided.\xa0 The lack of this task training directly contributed to the accident.\xa0', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'A root cause analysis was conducted and the following root cause was identified:Root Cause: The mine operator failed to have proper policies and procedures, including training, for miners working in the confined space of the rail car.\xa0\xa0\xa0Corrective Action: Management established procedures and controls to assure safe rail car entry.\xa0 A procedure was developed to include life line and attendants, rescue capability, ventilation, and atmospheric monitoring.\xa0 All miners will be provided adequate task training in the health and safety aspects of this task before performing rail car entry.', 'CONCLUSION': 'The accident occurred because management policies and procedures failed to address all health and safety hazards associated with cleaning railcars. All hazards were not identified to ensure that persons could safely perform the task.\xa0 Because of the inadequate policies and procedures, proper task training on the health and safety aspects of the car washing job was not given.\xa0 Rail tank cars were not treated as a confined space.\xa0 The air quality inside the tank cars was not properly monitored and an attendant manning a lifeline was not used.'}","on the day of the accident, july 15, 2015, travis barnes (victim), contract employee with cvb, reported to work at approximately 6 a.m. his normal starting time. barnes first reported to the track shed. at 6:05 a.m., barnes and tony butts, both car washers for cvb, left the track shed to start sealing loaded railcars to prepare for shipment. at approximately 6:40 a.m., barnes went back to the track shed to complete paperwork, wait for the train to pull out the loaded railcars and spot the empty railcars in the wash area of the plant. at 7:30 a.m., the train arrived to pull out the loaded cars but did not have any empty cars to leave. the train did not return with the empty cars until 10 a.m.at that time, the car washers left the track shed to go and wash the empty cars. jim dunn, thiele track supervisor, saw barnes at approximately 11:00 a.m., preparing to move five cars down the track to the washing area. barnes was seen again on top of the accident car on track #2 by antonio watts, thiele car washer, who had been on the adjacent track #3 washing cars. watts went to track #6 to talk to terry gilmore, track leadman with thiele. when watts returned to the wash area, he noticed that barnes had not started to wash the railcar. watts was concerned that barnes was inside the railcar longer than usual. watts then climbed the railcar access ladder to check on barnes. watts saw barnes was inside the railcar unresponsive. barnes was not equipped with a lifeline and there was not a second person present. watts called dunn, who was off site at lunch. dunn called ronnie adams, production foreman, and told him to call 911.emergency services were called at 12:06 p.m. willie durden, thiele employee and volunteer fireman, was working at the plant and received the call on his fire pager at 12:08 p.m. durden was the first on the scene and immediately entered the railcar. police and ems arrived right after durden. a rope was dropped into the railcar and durden hooked it to barnes’ fall protection harness. barnes was lifted out of the railcar and cpr was immediately started. barnes was transported by ambulance to washington county regional medical center where he was pronounced dead by e. k. may, washington county coroner. the cause of death was attributed to environmental suffocation."

Roell, Superintendent, age 50, was killed while operating a dredge at this sand and gravel operation.\xa0 Roell and another miner were attempting to dislodge the clamshell bucket from the bottom of a lake when the dredge capsized.\xa0 The miner was injured when he was thrown from the dredge as it capsized, but was able to swim to shore.\xa0 Divers recovered Roell from the motor control center (MCC) room in the submerged dredge eight days later.The accident occurred due to management’s failure to consult with the manufacturer or follow its recommended safe procedures when attempting to dislodge the dredge bucket from the lake bottom.\xa0 As a result, the dredge was used beyond the design capacity intended by the manufacturer.\xa0 In addition, mine management participated in the removal of the dredge’s pontoon overload sensors, knew about its unfastened pontoon hatches and did not correct these conditions before continuing to operate the dredge.\xa0 These modifications directly impacted the stability of the dredge and contributed to the cause of the accident.\xa0 Finally, mine management failed to provide task training to miners in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommended safe procedures for dislodging or recovering a dredge bucket.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'The Dry Fork Sand & Gravel mine, owned and operated by Hanson Aggregates Midwest, LLC, is located in Cleves, Hamilton County, Ohio.\xa0 The principal operating official is Denis Dolan, Regional President.\xa0 William J. Roell, Superintendent, was the person in charge of health and safety at the mine.\xa0 The mine operates one, 10-hour shift, 5 days per week and employs 6 persons.Material is dredged from the bottom of a man-made lake, screened, and then conveyed from the dredge to the shore via an attached floating belt conveyor system.\xa0 The material is then transported by truck to a plant for additional sizing and stock piled.\xa0 The finished product is sold in bulk as construction aggregates, primarily for the ready mix concrete industry.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on November 19, 2014.SIGNIFICANT EVENTS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENTFrom witness statements, the dredge involved in the accident had been used previously to mine material at the James Bunnell Inc.’s Bunnell Gravel Pit #2 (Mine I.D. No. 33-01414).\xa0 In 1999, a manufacturer’s representative provided two-weeks of hands-on task training for operating the dredge to the dredge operator, Garry L. Dowd.\xa0 Later that year, Dowd provided a one-week hands-on task training session in dredge operations to William J. Roell.\xa0 At that time, Todd J. Ernst was the plant manager and Roell was a mechanic.\xa0 In late 1999, the dredge’s clamshell bucket became stuck at the bottom of the lake.\xa0 The mine operator detached the bucket, installed a new bucket on shore and used it to dig out the buried bucket.\xa0 This method followed the manufacturer’s recommended procedures. \xa0Ernst, Dowd, and Roell all participated in the recovery of the dredge bucket.In 2000, the dredge was moved to Dry Fork Sand & Gravel, its current location.\xa0 At that time, James Bunnell Inc. owned and operated the mine.\xa0 Dowd and Roell were moved to the new operation.\xa0 Dowd continued to operate the dredge and Roell filled in during his absences.\xa0 In January 2003, Hanson Aggregates Midwest, LLC bought the mine.\xa0 In 2007, Roell was promoted to the superintendent position.On June 29, 2015, Dowd was placed on extended leave.\xa0 On the next day, Roell operated the dredge and the clamshell bucket became stuck at the bottom of the lake.\xa0 According to Dowd, Roell called him on the telephone and discussed the incident.\xa0 Roell stated that the bucket was stuck at an approximate depth of 65 feet and the hoisting breakers had tripped.\xa0 Roell asked Dowd if the breakers could be reset.\xa0 Dowd answered that it was too difficult to explain from his hospital bed and suggested that Roell call Busy Bee Electric, the mine’s electrical contractor.On July 1, 2015, Roell called James Oehlschlaeger, President of Busy Bee Electric.\xa0 As a result, Oehlschlaeger visited the mine and checked the circuits on the hoist.\xa0 He found the CR10 and CR11 breakers open, so he reset them.\xa0 While Oehlschlaeger was still onsite, Roell attempted to hoist the bucket from the lake bottom in manual mode and again tripped the breakers.\xa0Afterward, Oehlschlaeger showed Roell how to reset the breakers and discussed ways to recover the stuck bucket, including the manufacturer’s recommended method.On the same day, Roell called Ernst, now the Area Manager, and informed him that the dredge bucket was stuck.\xa0 They also discussed the method that Roell proposed to use to dislodge it from the lake bottom.\xa0 In his interview, Ernst stated that Roell was going to fill the pontoons with water, tension the hoist rope, clamp the hoist brakes and then pump the water from the pontoons.On July 2, 2015, Roell stopped at F&M Mafco, a nearby heavy equipment supplier, and purchased two industrial strength C-clamps.\xa0 When Roell arrived at the mine, he assigned Kelly J. Raver, Equipment Operator, and Craig H. Hornberger Sr., Truck Driver, to assist on the dredge.\xa0 After they boarded the dredge, they proceeded to implement the procedure that Roell had outlined to Ernst on the previous day.\xa0 Roell cautioned Raver and Hornberger that if they heard anything or felt anything unusual to jump off the dredge.\xa0 Afterward, they removed the five overload sensors from their associated housings and opened a portion of the pontoon hatches.\xa0 Then, water was pumped into the pontoons.\xa0 As the pontoons filled with water, they put the hatch covers back in place but did not secure them.\xa0 This process lowered the dredge in the water.\xa0 From witness statements, the “free board” measured 10 inches (distance from the dredge deck to the water level).\xa0 At that point, Roell operated the dredge hoist to tension the hoist rope, lowering the dredge further to 4\xa0inches of free board.\xa0 Then, as Roell had instructed, Raver and Hornberger installed the C‑clamps on the hoist brakes to keep the hoist rope from back-spooling.\xa0 Next, Raver and Hornberger began to pump water from the flooded pontoons.\xa0 Roell marked the water level in the “moon pool” (opening through the middle of the dredge) and they left the dredge.The dredge sat idle in this position for the extended holiday weekend (July 3 through July 5, 2015).\xa0 On July 6, 2015, Roell called Ernst and reported that the attempt to dislodge the bucket did not work and that he was going to let the dredge sit for a few days before attempting the same procedure again.\xa0 Ernst agreed with the plan.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On the day of the accident, July 10, 2015, William J. Roell, Superintendent (victim), and Robert E. Cooley, Truck Driver, reported to work at 7:00 a.m., their normal starting time.\xa0 Roell assigned Cooley to assist on the dredge.\xa0 Cooley had no experience at working on the dredge and had no knowledge of the previous attempt to recover the bucket.In order to repeat the process, Roell disconnected the C‑clamps from the hoist brakes.\xa0 Next, Cooley assisted Roell in flooding the pontoons with water, lowering the free board to 6 ½ inches.\xa0 Afterward, Roell instructed Cooley to reinstall the C-clamps on the hoist brakes as he tensioned the hoist cable from the operator’s compartment.\xa0 Then, Cooley and Roell began to pump water from the flooded pontoons.\xa0 At 11:15 a.m., they stopped for lunch.When they returned to the dredge, Cooley noticed water coming up over the deck.\xa0 Roell asked Cooley to take the C-clamps off the hoist brakes as he ascended the stairs to the operator’s compartment.\xa0 Cooley went to the storage room (located in the bottom blue conex) to look for a wrench to loosen the C-clamps.\xa0 At that time, the dredge was already listing to one side and the tool box had fallen over and the tools were spread out across the floor.\xa0 When Cooley finally located a crescent wrench, he left the storage room and started up the stairs toward the hoist.\xa0 As he climbed the stairs, Roell ran down past him.\xa0 Roell stopped momentarily to tell him that he had already taken the clamps off of the hoist brakes.\xa0 As Cooley continued to climb the stairs, he heard a very loud bang and the dredge capsized.\xa0 Cooley was thrown from the stairs and landed in the water.\xa0 Although injured during the fall, Cooley, wearing his life jacket, managed to stay afloat on the water for some time.\xa0 During that time, Cooley called Roell repeatedly but did not get a response, so he swam to shore.\xa0 When Cooley reached the shore, he got in Roell’s pickup truck and drove to the scale house.\xa0 When Cooley entered, he informed David A. Thierauf, Scale Clerk/Inside Sales, and Thomas R.

Pace, equipment operator, age 65, was killed while operating a front-end loader at the base of a sand bank.\xa0 Pace was trapped in the operator’s cab when a portion of the bank collapsed and engulfed the front-end loader.The accident occurred due to mine management’s failure to utilize previously established mining methods to maintain wall, bank, and slope stability in the area.\xa0 The victim was extracting material from the base of a 128 feet high bank that was not sloped to a safe angle.\xa0 In addition, management failed to adequately examine the mining area prior to commencing work and periodically throughout the shift as changing ground conditions warranted.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'CEC #4 (also referred to as Pit 46), a surface sand and gravel operation owned and operated by P.\xa0A. Landers Incorporated, is located in Plymouth, Plymouth County, Massachusetts. \xa0The principal operating official was Preston A. Landers, Owner. \xa0The mine operates one eight hour shift per day, five days a week. Three miners are employed at CEC #4.Sand and gravel is mined using a front-end loader to extract material from the base of a sand bank and feed a portable screening plant.\xa0 The material is screened, sized, and sold for use in the construction industry.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection of this operation on June 18, 2015.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On the day of the accident, Charles E. Pace (victim) reported for work at his normal start time of 6:00 a.m. He waited at the mine access gate for Peter C. Johnson, Equipment Operator, who arrived at about 6:15 a.m. and unlocked the gate. Afterward, Pace proceeded to the pit and prepared the screening plant for production. Johnson unlocked the scale house and then traveled the roadways, examining the site and looking for evidence of trespassers. Johnson then went to the mobile equipment parking area and began check-out and start-up of equipment to be used during the shift. When Johnson traveled to the screening plant, Pace was completing his daily maintenance activities. At that time, Johnson began loading customer trucks and Pace began feeding the screening plant with material extracted from the sand bank.About 10:15 a.m., Pace and Johnson took a break since there were no customer trucks in the pit. At 10:35 a.m., Johnson returned to loading customer trucks and Pace returned to feeding the plant. At approximately 10:45 a.m., Johnson drove around the plant to move material from the oversize stacker conveyor and observed Pace’s front-end loader partially buried at the bottom of the sand bank. Pace’s front-end loader was still running with its lights on and the backup alarm sounding. Johnson immediately radioed Anna Pesonen, Scale House Clerk, and asked her to call 9-1-1 for emergency assistance. Johnson then used his front-end loader to dig along the left side of Pace’s machine in an attempt to free it from the fallen material. Pesonen called 9-1-1 and remained on the line with the dispatcher until she heard the sirens from the rescue vehicles arriving onsite.Christopher D. O’Neil, truck driver, was leaving the pit after being loaded and heard Johnson’s radio request to call 9-1-1. O’Neil turned his truck around and returned to the pit. At that time, Johnson was still removing sand from the left side of Pace’s front-end loader. After exiting his truck, O’Neill ran to the right side of Pace’s front-end loader and began digging by hand until he was able to force the right side window open. Then, he began to dig sand from inside of the cab.Joseph M. Southwell, truck driver, had driven to the site to be loaded when he observed the activity around Pace’s front-end loader. Southwell exited his truck and ran to a nearby mini-excavator and trammed it into position along the right rear side of Pace’s machine to assist O’Neil. Johnson asked Southwell to leave the excavator and go get a bulldozer.Arnold J. Werra, truck driver, had his truck on the scale when Pesonen informed him of the accident and asked him to take her van to the pit to assist. Werra obliged and brought shovels with him to Pace’s front-end loader. He helped to dig sand until the local fire department arrived and then he left the mine.Stephen Nava, truck driver, was traveling to the scale house with a loaded truck when he heard the radio calls for help. He waited for the emergency service vehicles to arrive and then escorted them to the scene. After helping them to unload their equipment, Nava drove Southwell to the bulldozer.At approximately 11:00 a.m., the rescue squad took charge of the scene. At that time, Pace was unresponsive and had no vital signs. An attempt was made to pull Pace’s front-end loader out of the sand bank using a tow chain and Johnson’s front-end loader; however, it failed when the tow chain broke. Then, Johnson’s front-end loader and Southwell’s bulldozer were moved into place along the left side of Pace’s front-end loader to shore up the embankment and provide protection for the recovery personnel. At approximately 3:00 p.m., after cutting away the rear window and using a vacuum truck to extract material from inside of the cab, Pace was removed from the machine. The cause of death was attributed to compressional asphyxiation.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'MSHA was notified of the accident at 11:14 a.m. on June 30, 2015, by a telephone call from Robert Haggerty, Safety Director, to the Department of Labor’s National Contact Center (DOLNCC). The DOLNCC notified Kevin H. Abel, Assistant District Manager, and an investigation was started the same day. An order was issued under provisions of Section 103(j) of the Mine Act. This order was later modified to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act after the arrival of an Authorized Representative at the mine site.MSHA’s accident investigation team traveled to the mine and conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident. MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, employees, and State and Local law enforcement.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Location of the Accident\nThe accident occurred in the northwestern section of the mine property, which was phase 4 of the mining cycle.\xa0 Phases 1 through 3 had been mined, reclaimed, and revegetated.\xa0 There were two entrances to Pit 46 located near the southwest corner of the property.\xa0 An access road crossed a dike between two cranberry bogs and entered the working area from the east.\xa0 The top of the pit slope was situated about 500 feet north of the access road (also referred to as a bog road) and near the northern boundary of phase 4.\xa0 The bottom of the slope was less than 400 feet from the access road.\xa0 The pit bottom dipped, less than 3 percent, toward the face of the slope.The work area included an excavation into the sand bank, the portable screening plant and stacker conveyor area, and the stockpile and loadout areas.\xa0 The excavation into the sand bank was v-shaped with an entrance about 120 feet wide near the toe of the reclaimed slope and narrowing to the north.\xa0 At about 120 feet into the v-shaped excavation, the pit was about 35 feet wide.\xa0 The v-shaped excavation was approximately 170 feet deep from the entrance.\xa0 About a month prior to the accident, the excavation was about 130 feet deep from the entrance. \xa0At the time of the accident, the victim was operating a front-end loader on the pit bottom, excavating material from the base of the sand bank.\xa0 The front-end loader was facing north and was reportedly backing up when the failure occurred.\xa0 The failure occurred near the top of the slope in the northwest corner of the excavation (see Figure 1).\xa0 The failed material slid in a southeasterly direction and covered the loader.\xa0 Sand and gravel broke through the windshield and engulfed the victim.\xa0At the north end of the excavation, the slope was about 120 feet high and had an overall inclination of about 41 degrees from horizontal.\xa0 However, the upper 80 feet was steeper than 44\xa0degrees and the top 15 feet of the slope had an inclination of about 58 degrees from horizontal (see Figure 2).Post-failure measurements determined that the slope in the northwest corner was about 128 feet high and had an overall inclination of about 40 degrees from horizontal.\xa0 The top 45 feet of the failed slope had an average inclination of about 48 degrees and the top 21 feet had an inclination of about 55 degrees from horizontal.Material Description\xa0\nThe material being mined was sand and gravel.\xa0 The gravel was rounded and the sand appeared to be predominantly fine grained.\xa0 The in situ material was dense, moist, and light brown in color.\xa0 Dense, moist sand can exhibit an apparent cohesion due to surface tension and negative capillary pore water pressure.\xa0 This strength is moisture sensitive and transitory.\xa0 Dry sand and saturated sand will lose all apparent cohesion.\xa0 The sand and gravel at Pit 46 appeared to exhibit these qualities.\xa0 At its natural moisture, this material had an apparent cohesion, which was moisture sensitive.\xa0 As this material was exposed to the air and sun, it lost some of its natural moisture, lost its cohesive strength, and sloughed off.\xa0 As the sand dried, its color changed to light tan.\xa0 The dry, loose sand and gravel had an angle of repose of about 33 degrees.\xa0 The sloughed material piled at the bottom of the bank and was mined.Equipment and Mining Practice\nThe mining practice employed in this pit used two rubber-tired front-end loaders (Caterpillar 980G and Caterpillar 972M), a track-mounted bulldozer (Caterpillar D8R), and an off-road haul truck.\xa0 A portable screening plant (Roadrunner CEC) and stacker conveyor (80-foot Anaconda) were used to segregate and stow the sand and gravel.\xa0 At the time of the accident, the victim was operating the Caterpillar 972M front-end loader.The company did not have a specific mining plan; however, mining had most recently started in the phase 4 area and had been advancing in a northerly direction.\xa0 In general, the mining method employed during phase 4 consisted of excavating material from the base of the slope using a front-end loader.\xa0 Joseph Southwell indicated that failures did occur and that the failures (sloughing) usually occurred when the natural material dried, which could be during the day or overnight.\xa0 Reportedly, a front-end loader would excavate the loose material that had fallen from the sand bank.\xa0 When all the loose material was removed, the operator would excavate into the undisturbed sand bank and move along the base until more material fell to the bottom.\xa0 The front-end loader excavating the sand bank loaded the raw material into the screen.\xa0 The sand was stockpiled using a stacker conveyor directly from the screen plant.\xa0 The gravel was piled near the plant.\xa0 A second equipment operator used a front-end loader to move the gravel portion to separate stockpiles and loaded customer trucks from the sand and gravel stockpiles.Engineering Evaluation\nAt its natural moisture, this material has an apparent cohesion, which is moisture sensitive.\xa0 As the material is exposed to the air and sun it loses some of its natural moisture, loses its cohesive strength and sloughs off.\xa0 The material being mined was mostly sand with an angle of repose of about 33 degrees.\xa0 However, the slope in natural material above the loose material was steeper than 33 degrees.\xa0 The average inclination of the slope in natural material was 48 degrees or more and the slopes near the top of the bank were measured to be up to 58 degrees from horizontal.\xa0Mining from the bottom of the slope relies upon material sliding to the pit bottom as the front-end loader removes material from the toe.\xa0 In this practice a relatively controlled shallow failure is induced by oversteepening the slope through removal of material from the toe.\xa0 A hazardous condition can develop when the material does not fail and slide shortly after excavation at the toe and the slope becomes oversteepened by the mining process.\xa0 Due to the apparent cohesion of the sandy material, slopes steeper than the angle of repose can stand for a period of time, but may fail suddenly.\xa0 With increasing height and oversteepening of the slope there is a decrease in stability and an increase in the volume of material that can potentially fail, both of which increase the hazard.\xa0 It is a good practice to move to flatter sloping areas when a significant portion of the slope becomes oversteepened.In some cases, removal of loose drier material from the bottom would induce failures that expose moist material that is oversteepened near the top of the slope.\xa0 In this case, the hazard also increases with the total height above the pit bottom, due to an increase in the potential energy of the falling material, and the height of the oversteepened portion above the loose material, which increases the potential volume.\xa0 Removal of the flatter sloping material from the toe exposes more of the oversteepened slope above, subjecting the bank to larger failures, and also moves the front-end loader closer to the oversteepened slope.\xa0 At Pit 46, it was primarily the natural material that was moist and would stand oversteepened.Weather\nOn the day of the accident, weather conditions were clear with temperatures in the low 80’s.\xa0 Average wind speed was 3 mph with gusts up to 20 mph.\xa0 On Sunday, June 28, 2015, two days before the accident, the recorded total rainfall for the area was 0.84 inches.\xa0 On the previous Sunday, the area had 0.81 inches of rainfall.\xa0 The investigators determined that the resultant wet conditions present at Pit 46, due to previous rainfall in the area, likely contributed to triggering the failure.Seismicity\nThe United State Geological Survey website had no record of an earthquake greater than a magnitude M1.5 within 50\xa0miles of the site during the month of June 2015.\xa0 The investigators concluded that the failure was not triggered by an earthquake.Summary\nThe operator was relying upon the process of natural and excavation induced failures to feed material to the pit bottom.\xa0 However, prolonged excavation at the toe of the sand bank created an oversteepened slope above the front-end loader.\xa0 The height of the oversteepened slope above the pit bottom was also excessive and unsafe to work below.\xa0 The great height of the sand bank contributed to the instability, and worsened the hazard by increasing the potential volume of material that could fail and the energy it had in falling.\xa0 Rainfall likely contributed to the instability and triggered the failure event by increasing the weight of the material.\xa0 The additional moisture infiltrating the natural material may have also contributed by reducing the apparent cohesion.\xa0 The excavation into the toe of the slope was also a triggering event for the failure.The active pit area was about 170 feet long and about 120 feet wide at its open end, which narrowed to about 35 feet wide near the back end of the front-end loader.\xa0 This pit configuration created a relatively narrow work space with pit slopes on three sides of the front-end loader.\xa0 The narrow pit dimensions exacerbated the consequences of the failure by reducing the area that falling material had to fill and exposing the front-end loader operator to additional oversteepened sand bank slopes.Although the mine operator had used bulldozers in the past to push the bank material down to a flatter slope, this mining practice had not been employed during this phase of mining.', 'TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE': 'Charles E. Pace had 19 years and 8 weeks of mining experience as an equipment operator, including 11 years and 8 weeks at this mine. A representative of MSHA’s Educational Field and Small Mines Services reviewed the mine operator’s Part 46 training records for Pace. The reviewer concluded that Pace had received all required training; however, the task training provided was not documented as required. A noncontributory citation was issued during an E16 Spot Inspection for this violation.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'A root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified.Root Cause: Management failed to utilize previously established mining methods to maintain wall, bank, and slope stability in the area. The mine operator had used bulldozers in the past to push the bank material down to a flatter slope; however, this mining practice had not been employed during this phase of mining. The victim was extracting material from the base of a 128 feet high bank that was not sloped to a safe angle.Corrective Action: Management established and implemented new policies and procedures to reclaim the existing phase 4 excavation (accident area). In addition, new policies and procedures were made to address future excavations at the mine. These new policies and procedures utilize bulldozers to push material down the slope toward the face of the excavation while maintaining a uniform slope gradient of 2.5:1 to 3:1. Future excavations will have a minimum working width of 300 feet, sloped on all three sides. The slope gradients will be monitored on a daily basis. Material pushed down the slope will be windrowed or stockpiled and will be loaded and transported to the screening plant. All mobile equipment operators were trained in these new policies and procedures.Root Cause: Management failed to adequately examine the mining area prior to commencing work and periodically throughout the shift as changing ground conditions warranted.Corrective Action: Management established and implemented an examination plan for the mining area and designated an exam coordinator, responsible for ensuring adequate examinations and monitoring slope gradients. Examinations of the face of the slope and side slopes will be conducted each day prior to the start of excavation and as weather conditions dictate, particularly during and after precipitation events. The slope surfaces will be evaluated for bulging, cuts, seepage, and cracking. Any adverse conditions found will be corrected prior to the commencement of mining in the area. Mining will also cease at any time during the shift when adverse conditions are encountered until they can be evaluated and addressed. All mobile equipment operators were trained by the exam coordinator in the new examination plan relative to identifying adverse ground conditions, changing slope conditions, and remedial actions.', 'CONCLUSION': 'The accident occurred due to mine management’s failure to establish mining methods to maintain wall, bank, and slope stability in the area. The victim was extracting material from the base of a 128 feet high bank that was not sloped to a safe angle. In addition, management failed to adequately examine the mining area prior to commencing work and periodically throughout the shift as changing ground conditions warranted.'}","on the day of the accident, charles e. pace (victim) reported for work at his normal start time of 6:00 a.m. he waited at the mine access gate for peter c. johnson, equipment operator, who arrived at about 6:15 a.m. and unlocked the gate. afterward, pace proceeded to the pit and prepared the screening plant for production. johnson unlocked the scale house and then traveled the roadways, examining the site and looking for evidence of trespassers. johnson then went to the mobile equipment parking area and began check-out and start-up of equipment to be used during the shift. when johnson traveled to the screening plant, pace was completing his daily maintenance activities. at that time, johnson began loading customer trucks and pace began feeding the screening plant with material extracted from the sand bank.about 10:15 a.m., pace and johnson took a break since there were no customer trucks in the pit. at 10:35 a.m., johnson returned to loading customer trucks and pace returned to feeding the plant. at approximately 10:45 a.m., johnson drove around the plant to move material from the oversize stacker conveyor and observed pace’s front-end loader partially buried at the bottom of the sand bank. pace’s front-end loader was still running with its lights on and the backup alarm sounding. johnson immediately radioed anna pesonen, scale house clerk, and asked her to call 9-1-1 for emergency assistance. johnson then used his front-end loader to dig along the left side of pace’s machine in an attempt to free it from the fallen material. pesonen called 9-1-1 and remained on the line with the dispatcher until she heard the sirens from the rescue vehicles arriving onsite.christopher d. o’neil, truck driver, was leaving the pit after being loaded and heard johnson’s radio request to call 9-1-1. o’neil turned his truck around and returned to the pit. at that time, johnson was still removing sand from the left side of pace’s front-end loader. after exiting his truck, o’neill ran to the right side of pace’s front-end loader and began digging by hand until he was able to force the right side window open. then, he began to dig sand from inside of the cab.joseph m. southwell, truck driver, had driven to the site to be loaded when he observed the activity around pace’s front-end loader. southwell exited his truck and ran to a nearby mini-excavator and trammed it into position along the right rear side of pace’s machine to assist o’neil. johnson asked southwell to leave the excavator and go get a bulldozer.arnold j. werra, truck driver, had his truck on the scale when pesonen informed him of the accident and asked him to take her van to the pit to assist. werra obliged and brought shovels with him to pace’s front-end loader. he helped to dig sand until the local fire department arrived and then he left the mine.stephen nava, truck driver, was traveling to the scale house with a loaded truck when he heard the radio calls for help. he waited for the emergency service vehicles to arrive and then escorted them to the scene. after helping them to unload their equipment, nava drove southwell to the bulldozer.at approximately 11:00 a.m., the rescue squad took charge of the scene. at that time, pace was unresponsive and had no vital signs. an attempt was made to pull pace’s front-end loader out of the sand bank using a tow chain and johnson’s front-end loader; however, it failed when the tow chain broke. then, johnson’s front-end loader and southwell’s bulldozer were moved into place along the left side of pace’s front-end loader to shore up the embankment and provide protection for the recovery personnel. at approximately 3:00 p.m., after cutting away the rear window and using a vacuum truck to extract material from inside of the cab, pace was removed from the machine. the cause of death was attributed to compressional asphyxiation."

Daniel Acker was positioned between the saw and the ledge, when he tripped and fell. The victim and the saw went over the 4½-foot ledge, resulting in the saw falling on him.The accident occurred due to the victim’s failure to maintain control of the self-propelled concrete saw that he was operating in reverse gear while repositioning to cut stone.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'Kane’s Quarry, a surface dimension stone mine, is located near Montrose, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. The principal operating official was Daniel Acker, Owner/Operator (victim). The mine typically operates one 8-hour shift, 5 days per week. Dimensional stone is removed from multiple benches using a self-propelled concrete saw. The saw operator follows a grid pattern laid out on each bench prior to cutting. Cut blocks or slabs are removed and transported to the yard for processing or shipment. The stone is sold for use in construction and landscaping. The investigators found that Daniel Acker had operated the mine for approximately three years at this location. Mr. Acker never applied for a MSHA identification number by submitting the MSHA Form 2000-7. Therefore, MSHA had never inspected this mine. The mine had reopened about four weeks prior to the accident following a winter shutdown. Daniel Acker had not notified the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) of the commencement of operations at the site as required by 30 CFR §56.1000. A non-contributory citation was issued for this violation.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On the day of the accident, March 23, 2015, Daniel Acker and Dylan Acker (victim’s son), Miner, arrived for work at 7:00 a.m., their normal start time. Due to inclement weather and icy conditions, they left the mine and returned about 12:30 p.m. At that time, the ice had melted from the active bench; however, the lower bench or sump area was still iced over. Daniel Acker started the saw and began cutting stone. At approximately 2:30 p.m., after making four north-to-south cuts and three west-to-east cuts, Daniel Acker attempted to reposition the saw and fell over the 4½-foot ledge to the sump area below, resulting in the saw falling on him.Dylan Acker was working near the upper access road and witnessed the accident. He immediately ran down to the sump, turned the saw off, and called 9-1-1 for emergency assistance. While waiting for help to arrive, Dylan Acker administered Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). At 2:39 p.m., Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at the mine access road and cut the lock on the entrance gate to enter the mine. After checking the victim, EMS requested assistance from Anthony J. Conarton, Susquehanna County Coroner, who pronounced the victim dead at the accident site. The cause of death was attributed to exsanguination (severe loss of blood).', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'MSHA was notified of the accident at 3:46 p.m. on March 23, 2015, by a telephone call from the Susquehanna County 911 Operations Center to the National Call Center. The National Call Center notified Joseph M. Denk, Staff Assistant, and an investigation was started the same day. An order was issued under provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act after the arrival of an Authorized Representative at the mine site.MSHA’s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed the mine employee, and reviewed work procedures relevant to the accident. MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection’s Bureau of Mine Safety, the Susquehanna County Coroner’s Office, and local and State law enforcement.', 'DISCUSSION': 'GeologyThe mining product consists of bluestone rock from the Catskill geologic formation. Bluestone is a unique sandstone formation found primarily in northeastern Pennsylvania and south-central New York. As sediments fossilized into rock, minerals carried by groundwater through the rock deposits created various colored strata. Bluestone derived its name from its typical blue color. Bluestone is characterized as a strong, stable rock that is resistant to cracking and does not discolor. Bluestone is typically marketed commercially in two types: dimensional (architectural grade) used for stair steps, flooring, countertops, etc.; and flagstone used for walls, walkways, and patios.Mining MethodOverburden is removed by a track-mounted front-end loader exposing the top layer of stone. A rectangular grid pattern using “chalk lines” is laid out on each bench for use as a guide during the extraction process. A walk-behind, self-propelled concrete saw is used to cut the slabs or blocks of stone from the bench. The cutting depth typically ranges from 15 to 17 inches. The saw operator positions several steel plates on the bench floor and levels each plate using wooden wedges or broken pieces of stone. This allows the saw operator to maneuver the saw on a level surface to produce a more uniform cut. The saw operator makes a series of cuts in the same direction along the chalk lines in each row of the grid. The steel plates are advanced to the next chalk line for each cut. The saw operator then turns the saw 90 degrees and cuts along the perpendicular chalk lines to complete the rectangular shape of each block. This sequence of steps is repeated until all of the cuts are made for the grid on each bench. The blocks or slabs are then removed with a skidsteer loader and transported to a yard where they are split into approximate 1-inch-thick flagstones. The flagstones are then stacked on wooden pallets and sold to customers as construction or decorative stone.Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred in the center of the quarry pit near the sump area (see Figure 1). A 25-foot-high waste pile of rocks is located to the east of the sump area, and the quarry access road and yard processing area are located to the west of the sump area. The sump area dimensions are approximately 40 feet wide by 80 feet long. Two benches had been created within the bluestone outcrop at the south end of the sump area. The upper bench is approximately 16 feet wide and the lower bench is approximately 18 feet wide. The high-wall above the upper bench is about 15 feet high and the high-wall above the lower bench is approximately 19½ feet high. Therefore, there is a 4½-foot height difference between the two benches. The exposed edge (drop-off) is oriented north to south and is approximately 10 feet long. The drop-off has a slope angle between 45 and 55 degrees. There is no berm or barrier installed along the edge of the upper bench. Prior to the accident, the victim had made four north-to-south cuts and three west-to-east cuts along the upper bench. At the time of the accident, he was repositioning the saw for a fourth west-to-east cut across the bench. During this repositioning, with his back facing the edge, the victim slipped and fell onto the lower bench.Concrete SawThe saw involved in the accident is a MECO (Husqvarna), Model 40D, walk-behind concrete saw manufactured in 2005. The saw is a self-propelled circular saw equipped with a 42-inch-diameter water-cooled blade. An air-cooled Hatz, Model 2M41Z, 34-horsepower, diesel engine powers the blade and the hydrostatic drive system. The machine is equipped with a 12-volt electrical system and electric starter. The saw operator stands at the rear of the machine and maneuvers the saw on its four wheels using two 32-inch-long non-retractable handlebars. The approximately 1,860 pound unit is approximately 70 inches long (not including the handlebars), 48 inches high, and 35 inches wide. After the accident, the saw was found in the reverse gear, and the left handlebar was bent up slightly.WeatherThe weather on the day of the accident consisted of a high temperature of 22 degrees Fahrenheit. Sunrise was at 7:03 a.m. In the morning, the area experienced some minor snow fall and temperatures in the lower teens. Dylan Acker indicated that due to the poor weather conditions in the morning, he and his father left the mine and returned about 12:30 p.m. Weather was not considered to contribute to the accident.', 'TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE': '\nDaniel Acker had approximately 20 years mining experience with no formal training.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': '\nThe investigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified the following root cause:\xa0Root Cause:\xa0The victim failed to maintain control of the self-propelled concrete saw that he was operating in reverse gear while repositioning to cut stone. No procedures were in place for persons to safely operate the walk-behind, self-propelled concrete saw on an elevated bench.Corrective Action:\xa0The victim was a sole proprietor and; therefore, the business terminated at the time of his death. Consequently, no corrective action was taken.', 'CONCLUSION': '\nThe accident occurred due to the victim’s failure to maintain control of the self-propelled concrete saw that he was operating in reverse gear while repositioning to cut stone.'}","on the day of the accident, march 23, 2015, daniel acker and dylan acker (victim’s son), miner, arrived for work at 7:00 a.m., their normal start time. due to inclement weather and icy conditions, they left the mine and returned about 12:30 p.m. at that time, the ice had melted from the active bench; however, the lower bench or sump area was still iced over. daniel acker started the saw and began cutting stone. at approximately 2:30 p.m., after making four north-to-south cuts and three west-to-east cuts, daniel acker attempted to reposition the saw and fell over the 4½-foot ledge to the sump area below, resulting in the saw falling on him.dylan acker was working near the upper access road and witnessed the accident. he immediately ran down to the sump, turned the saw off, and called 9-1-1 for emergency assistance. while waiting for help to arrive, dylan acker administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr). at 2:39 p.m., emergency medical services (ems) arrived at the mine access road and cut the lock on the entrance gate to enter the mine. after checking the victim, ems requested assistance from anthony j. conarton, susquehanna county coroner, who pronounced the victim dead at the accident site. the cause of death was attributed to exsanguination (severe loss of blood)."

Maintenance is conducted as needed.\xa0 The mine is ventilated with nine main mine fans and two bleeder fans.\xa0 Coal is transported from the working sections to the surface via conveyor belt. \xa0Battery, trolley, and diesel powered, rail-mounted vehicles are used to transport supplies and mine personnel.\xa0 The mine liberates 12,625,615 cubic feet of methane every 24 hours.The principal officials for the McElroy mine were:\nEric Grimm................................. General Manager\nEric Koontz................................. General Superintendent\nEric Lipinski............................... Superintendent\xa0\nJeff Crowe................................... Mine Foreman\nRichard Marcavitch................... Director of Safety\xa0\nA regular MSHA Health and Safety Inspection (E01) was in progress during the time of the accident. \xa0The Non-Fatal Days Lost (NFDL) incidence rate for the mine during the calendar year 2014 was 4.19, compared to the national average of 3.28 in 2014 for mines of this type.\xa0', 'DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On the day shift, Friday, March 6, 2015, the 12-East longwall section was undergoing a power move.\xa0 The electrical and hydraulic components for the longwall face were being moved outby to allow the longwall to continue retreating. \xa0During the power move, management noticed the shields and panline, from the No. 2 shield to approximately the No. 10 shield, beginning to ramp up on top of coal and that the longwall shearer was cutting out-of-seam by mining approximately one foot of roof rock in this area. \xa0The section resumed production on the afternoon shift and attempted to realign the face to correct the out-of-seam (horizon) condition by taking cuts off the tailgate end of the longwall face.\xa0 Nick Shanks, Assistant Longwall Coordinator – East Side, arrived on the section around 10:00 p.m., Saturday, March 7, 2015. \xa0He observed the panline and shields continuing to ramp up and the shearer cutting approximately five feet of roof rock and two feet of coal. \xa0The No. 2 shield was also fouled and would no longer pull in. \xa0Shanks made the decision to halt production to correct the condition. \xa0The tailgate end of the longwall face had retreated 38 feet outby the headgate at this time.Shanks made phone calls to senior mine management officials to inform them of the situation. \xa0A plan was devised to bolt the roof between the longwall shield tips and the face, then drill and blast the coal in front of and under the panline. \xa0The goal was to remove the loose coal and material in front of the panline to allow the longwall to trend downward, back into the coal seam once mining resumed. \xa0After making the calls, Shanks talked to Ben Phillips, Shift Foreman, about getting the necessary supplies to the section.Eric Koontz, General Superintendent, and Eric Lipinski, Superintendent, arrived at the mine at approximately 6:00 a.m., on Sunday, March 8, 2015.\xa0 They travelled underground to the 12-East Longwall section to evaluate the out-of-seam condition. \xa0Matt Jarrett, Longwall Coordinator –East Side, arrived on the section shortly afterward. \xa0The necessary supplies arrived on the section and the midnight crew began roof bolting at 7:15 a.m. \xa0They started at the No. 6 shield using a hydraulic Z-drill and bolted toward the headgate until relieved by day shift.Jason Drake, Shearer Operator, and Mike Rettinger, Longwall Utility Man, continued roof bolting on day shift. \xa0During the roof bolting process, they attempted to install a 6-foot point anchor bolt (with an expansion shell and two feet of resin) in the face at the No. 4 shield. \xa0The bolt bent as it was inserted in the hole. \xa0When it was removed, the expansion shell was left in the hole. \xa0An attempt to support the face was made in the same hole using a four-foot point anchor bolt with no resin. \xa0This bolt also bent during installation. \xa0The roof bolters were told not to continue installing support in the face since both attempts to install rib bolts into the face were unsuccessful.\xa0 However, the roof of the area from No. 6 shield to the headgate was fully roof bolted by approximately 12:00 p.m.Ron Koontz, Director of Longwalls for Murray Energy, arrived at the mine shortly after the start of day shift and traveled to the section. \xa0He was in charge of the blasting work.\xa0 The crew began drilling two sets of holes in the mine floor for blasting. \xa0The first set of five holes was drilled in the area near the stage loader and the No. 3 shield. \xa0The second set of six holes was drilled in the area near the No. 5 and No. 6 shields. \xa0The miners were moved outby the longwall face, and the first set of holes were loaded and blasted.\xa0 After R. Koontz examined the area, the crew returned to the face to shovel. \xa0After approximately five minutes, the decision was made to remove the miners from the area again and blast the second set of holes. \xa0The first two blasts were completed at approximately 1:30 p.m.\xa0 The area was examined again by R. Koontz, and the crew returned to the face to shovel the blasted material onto the panline. \xa0The crew loaded the face conveyor chain and ran it multiple times to transport the material off the face.The crew continued to drill additional holes in the mine floor for blasting. \xa0A set of five holes and a set of six holes were drilled in the area near the No. 3 and No. 5 shields. The afternoon shift was scheduled to blast these holes upon arrival on the section. \xa0Lipinski, E. Koontz, and R. Koontz left the 12-East Longwall at 2:30 p.m. to meet with\xa0\nBrian Hennebert, Longwall Production Foreman, Mike Kozak, Assistant Director of Longwalls for Murray Energy, and Garloch to discuss plans for the afternoon shift.\xa0 \xa0\xa0Garloch then traveled underground to the 14-West Longwall where the mine’s other longwall was being moved. \xa0His plans were to check on the longwall move and then travel to 12-East Longwall to assist with correcting the out-of-seam condition.Kozak and Hennebert rode into the mine with the afternoon shift crew and arrived on the 12-East Longwall at approximately 4:30 p.m. \xa0Kozak was in charge of the blasting work on afternoon shift and he informed the crew of the plan to blast the coal between the panline and the face. \xa0The crew was moved outby the longwall face so the holes drilled by day shift could be loaded and blasted.\xa0 The two blasts were made at approximately 5:30 p.m. \xa0Kozak examined the area and the crew returned to the face to shovel.\xa0 A crack was observed in the face near the area of No.5 shield.\xa0 While the crew shoveled the blasted material onto the panline, the face conveyor chain was loaded and ran multiple times to transport the material off the face.\xa0The crew began drilling more holes for additional blasting. \xa0Two sets of five holes were drilled at an angle underneath the panline in the area between the No. 2 to No. 6 shields. The crew was moved outby the longwall face between 7:45 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., so the holes could be loaded and blasted. \xa0At this time, Garloch arrived on the 12-East Longwall. \xa0After the two blasts were made, Hennebert, Kozak, Garloch, and Richard Miller, Maintenance Foreman, went to examine the face area.The area was examined by Kozak, determined to be safe, and the miners traveled back to the longwall face to continue work. \xa0Charles Neitzelt, Shearer Operator, and Hennebert jack hammered under the panline at the edge of the No. 3 and No. 4 shields to remove the coal.\xa0 The remaining crew members shoveled the blasted material from the No. 2 to No. 6 shields onto the panline. \xa0Ken Torac, Loader Operator; Colby Yarbrough, Miner Bolter; and Chris Cox, Rib Bolter Operator, began installing roof bolts around the No. 7 shield and bolted toward the tailgate.At approximately 8:55 p.m., shortly after running shoveled material off the face conveyor chain, a piece of coal and rock fell from the face between the No. 4 and No. 6 shield, striking Garloch, Hennebert, Neitzelt, and Josh Roth, Shuttle Car Operator. \xa0The material was approximately 10 feet long, five feet wide, and up to two feet thick.\xa0 Roth, who was standing at the edge of the No. 5 and No. 6 shield, was struck in the left shoulder and knocked to the ground. \xa0A piece of the material pinned his leg, but it was quickly removed by crew members standing nearby. \xa0Neitzelt and Hennebert were knocked to the ground and pinned by the fallen material.\xa0 Coworkers freed Neitzelt and Hennebert when Kozak and John Beattie, Faceman, noticed that Garloch was under the rock. \xa0Kozak, Beattie, and other crew members attempted to lift the rock off of Garloch, but were unsuccessful. \xa0Beattie checked for a pulse, but none was detected.\xa0 While they continued to free Garloch, other crew members ran outby to retrieve first-aid materials and additional tools to help lift the rock. \xa0The crew members returned to the face with jacks, crib blocks and cap boards. \xa0The rock was raised up with the jacks and blocked, freeing the victim.The victim was placed on a backboard and transported to the Mac-8 emergency ride located in the last open crosscut at crosscut #29. \xa0Matt Remke, Longwall Shield Operator/Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), and Beattie placed the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) on Garloch’s chest, but no heart rhythms were detected.\xa0 The victim was transferred to a rail-mounted mantrip and transported to the Cameron Portal elevator.\xa0 The mantrip was met by Chad Lucas, EMT, who administered Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) to the victim while on the elevator.\xa0 The victim was transported from the mine site by Cameron Emergency Medical Services (EMS). \xa0Dr. Katherine Langley, M.D. with West Virginia University Hospital (WVUH) Medcom, pronounced the victim dead at 9:45 p.m., while in transport to Reynolds Memorial Hospital in Glen Dale, West Virginia.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'Richard Marcavitch, Director of Safety, notified the MSHA Call Center at 9:11 p.m., on Sunday, March 8, 2015, and reported a rib roll had occurred on the 12-East Longwall and one miner was trapped under a rock. \xa0Chad Currence, Bridgeport Field Office Supervisor, received notification of the accident from the call center at 9:19 p.m. \xa0Currence contacted the mine and issued a verbal 103(j) order at 9:30 p.m., to ensure the safety and health of the miners and to preserve the accident scene. \xa0Nicholas Blevins, Mining Engineer - Roof Control, and Michael Kelley, Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Specialist\xa0 - Roof Control, were immediately dispatched to the mine by Michael Stark, Staff Assistant. \xa0The 103(j) order was modified to a 103(k) order upon arrival at the mine.The accident investigation was conducted by MSHA personnel in conjunction with the West Virginia Office of Miner’s Health, Safety, and Training (WVMHS&T), Ohio Valley Resources, Inc., and the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). \xa0The investigation was initiated on the day of the accident. \xa0Upon arrival to the mine, the accident investigation team was briefed of the circumstances of the accident. \xa0Prior to going underground, preliminary discussions were conducted with the afternoon shift miners assigned to work on the 12-East Longwall. \xa0The investigation team travelled to the accident scene to make observations, take measurements, and take photographs. \xa0Following the initial underground investigation, the 103(k) order was modified to allow the mine operator to survey and map the accident scene (See Appendix A).On Monday, March 9, 2015, Eric Case, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, arrived at the mine on day shift to continue the investigation along with Carlos Mosley, District Manager and Stark. \xa0Additional photographs and measurements were taken and additional relevant documents obtained.On Tuesday, March 10, 2015, the miners assigned to work on the 12-East Longwall on the day shift prior to the accident were interviewed (See Appendix B).On Tuesday, March 17, 2015, and Wednesday, March 18, 2015, formal interviews were conducted at the Murray Energy Training Center located near Moundsville, West Virginia. \xa0Representatives of the victim’s family were present during the interviews (See Appendix C).Discussion12-east Longwall\xa0\nThe accident occurred on the 12-East Longwall face at the No. 4 shield, approximately 12 feet from the headgate end of the face. \xa0The longwall equipment mines the coal block between the 12-East headgate section and the 11-East tailgate section. \xa0The longwall panel is approximately 1,400 feet wide and 6,800 feet long. \xa0At the time of the accident, the headgate had retreated to survey station (spad) No. 29+48 and the tailgate had retreated to spad No. 29+10.\xa0 The last open crosscut was located at the No. 29 block, between the No. 2 and No. 3 entries. \xa0The 12-East Longwall headgate overburden thickness was 1,008 feet at the time of the accident. \xa0An Analysis of Longwall Pillar Stability (ALPS) determined the pillar stability factor in the area. \xa0The analysis showed the loading in the headgate area had a stability factor of 2.83.\xa0 The pillar design parameters present near the accident location were used in the analysis. \xa0The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended pillar stability factor for retreat longwall mining is 1.30. \xa0The pillar design was adequate for handling the overburden weight and exceeded the recommended stability factor.Face ConditionThe out-of-seam face was approximately seven feet high prior to the drilling and blasting process.\xa0 Throughout the day shift and afternoon shift, the face height increased from seven feet to approximately 12 feet, due to the removal of the material in front of and under the pan line. \xa0The face strata from the mine floor to the roof was approximately four feet of coal, one foot of rock binder, two feet of coal, and five feet of laminated shale at the time of the accident.The increased face height caused the heavier shale rock (approximately 170 lbs/ft2) to put pressure on the weaker, unconfined coal face (approximately 80 lbs/ft2). The pressure caused the coal face to slough off during afternoon shift. \xa0As the shift progressed, the movement in the shale strata created a crack in the face at the No. 5 shield. \xa0The crack grew larger, forming a separation that could only be seen from the tailgate side looking towards the headgate. \xa0The rock fell from the face from the same area where the crack was seen.\xa0 MSHA Investigators however, cannot definitively say that the crack caused the fall.\xa0 The material that fell from the face measured approximately 12 feet long, 5 feet wide, and up to 2 feet thick.\xa0 The piece broke and the material that struck the victim measured approximately 10 feet long, 5 feet wide, and up to 2 feet thick.Roof Control PlanThe last fully revised and consolidated roof control plan for this mine was approved by MSHA on March 28, 2013, with nine revisions since that time. \xa0This mine has rib bolting procedures that are to be used during continuous mining machine development. \xa0Rib bolting is also required when mining trenches for belt or overcast installations when the height exceeds 10 feet. \xa0The roof control plan had requirements when work is performed between the panline and the longwall face. \xa0The face conveyor breaker must be placed in the lock out position and the rib or face shall be tested and any loose material shall be secured or pulled down before performing such work. \xa0Where the distance between the shield tips and face exceeds five feet, temporary supports shall be installed in the work area. \xa0The distance from the tip of the shield to the face was in excess of five feet where Garloch was working when the accident occurred.\xa0 The roof from No. 6 shield to the headgate had been fully roof bolted.\xa0 However, no face supports were installed where Garloch was working.Mining MethodLongwall mining is dependent on maintaining the longwall face in the center of the gate entries as it is retreated out of the panel.\xa0 Uneven retreat of the face ends can cause the longwall mining machine to shift off the gate center.\xa0 When the longwall shifts too far to one end or the other, the shearer does not have clearance to properly cut out the solid coal block.\xa0 This will leave stumps of coal in the roof and floor.\xa0 The headgate or tailgate panline will begin to ride up on the coal stump and the shearer cannot properly clean the cuttings from in front of the panline.\xa0 This condition will worsen and create an out-of-seam condition, if not recognized and corrected.\xa0The 12 East Longwall production records for the 10 days preceding the accident were reviewed to determine the mining practices and rates of retreat.\xa0 Mine management normally operates the 12 East Longwall face with the tailgate face location retreated 15 feet further out of the panel than the headgate face location.\xa0 The midnight shift crew normally mined extra cuts off the tailgate end to maintain this differential from February 26th until March 3rd.\xa0\xa0 The extra cuts were not taken on March 3, 2015, and by the end of the shift the tailgate end was only 4 feet outby the headgate.\xa0 No extra cuts off the tailgate end were taken over the next several shifts and by the end of midnight shift on March 5, 2015, the headgate end was 24 feet outby the tailgate end.\xa0 This differential caused the longwall face to shift toward the tailgate entry.The operator directed extra cuts to be mined off the tailgate end to shift the longwall face back toward the headgate and additional clean up passes were made with the shearer to remove more material from in front of the panline.\xa0 These actions were unsuccessful.\xa0 On Day Shift, March 6, 2015, management noticed that the headgate end panline were climbing up and creating an out-of-seam condition.The afternoon shift crew continued to take cuts off the tailgate end, but the condition worsened and by the end of the shift, the panline had climbed an additional four feet and the shearer was cutting approximately five feet of rock. The No. 2 shield became fouled and would no longer pull in due to the elevated panline so management decided to halt production and take other measures to correct the condition.\xa0 The tailgate end of the longwall face was retreated 38 feet outby the headgate at this time.\xa0ExaminationsThe mine operator is required to conduct examinations of work areas for hazardous conditions and violations of mandatory health and safety standards. \xa0The mine operator is required to conduct additional examinations following blasting work to identify misfires, methane, or other hazardous conditions. \xa0Near the beginning of afternoon shift, a crack appeared in front of the No.5 shield. \xa0As the shift progressed, the crack reportedly grew larger. \xa0Two additional examinations were made as a result of blasting on afternoon shift. \xa0These examinations did not identify the crack. \xa0During the investigation, the crack was not visible in face. \xa0Therefore, investigators were not able to determine if the crack contributed to the fatal accident. \xa0A non-contributory violation was issued for 30 CFR 75.1326 because of these examinations.Experience and TrainingGarloch had 12 years and 48 weeks of total mining experience; all at this mine. \xa0A review of the training records showed Garloch was provided annual refresher training on April 2, 2014. \xa0The records also indicate Garloch was task trained for operating the longwall.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'An analysis was conducted to identify the underlying cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \xa0Causal factors were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the factors identified during the analysis and the corrective actions that were implemented to prevent a similar reoccurrence.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator failed to adequately support the roof, face, and ribs of areas where miners work or travel.Corrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator revised the roof control plan to address out-of-seam conditions. \xa0The revision stipulates the procedures and equipment needed to protect the miners from fall of roof, face, and ribs.\xa0 The affected miners were trained in the revised roof control plan.\xa0 The revised safety precautions will be reviewed with all miners prior to working in the affected area.Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not have effective policies, programs, procedures, or training programs in place to ensure that proper actions are taken to limit or prevent the longwall from shifting off of proper alignment and mining off-center.Corrective Action:The mine operator established a training program for all miners that work on the longwall.\xa0 The training program outlines the procedures or actions that should be taken to limit or prevent the longwall from mining out-of-seam.\xa0\xa0 All affected miners were trained in the new procedures.Root Cause:\xa0\xa0The mine operator did not have effective policies, programs, procedures, or controls in place to protect miners from a fall of the longwall face while miners are positioned on the panline or between the panline and the longwall face.Corrective Action:\xa0\xa0The mine operator revised the roof control plan. \xa0The revision stipulates the procedures and equipment needed to protect the miners from fall of roof and face if miners are required to be on the face side of the panline for any reason.\xa0 The affected miners were trained in the revised roof control plan.\xa0 The revised safety precautions will be reviewed with all miners prior to working in the affected area.'}","on the day shift, friday, march 6, 2015, the 12-east longwall section was undergoing a power move.  the electrical and hydraulic components for the longwall face were being moved outby to allow the longwall to continue retreating.  during the power move, management noticed the shields and panline, from the no. 2 shield to approximately the no. 10 shield, beginning to ramp up on top of coal and that the longwall shearer was cutting out-of-seam by mining approximately one foot of roof rock in this area.  the section resumed production on the afternoon shift and attempted to realign the face to correct the out-of-seam (horizon) condition by taking cuts off the tailgate end of the longwall face.  nick shanks, assistant longwall coordinator – east side, arrived on the section around 10:00 p.m., saturday, march 7, 2015.  he observed the panline and shields continuing to ramp up and the shearer cutting approximately five feet of roof rock and two feet of coal.  the no. 2 shield was also fouled and would no longer pull in.  shanks made the decision to halt production to correct the condition.  the tailgate end of the longwall face had retreated 38 feet outby the headgate at this time.shanks made phone calls to senior mine management officials to inform them of the situation.  a plan was devised to bolt the roof between the longwall shield tips and the face, then drill and blast the coal in front of and under the panline.  the goal was to remove the loose coal and material in front of the panline to allow the longwall to trend downward, back into the coal seam once mining resumed.  after making the calls, shanks talked to ben phillips, shift foreman, about getting the necessary supplies to the section.eric koontz, general superintendent, and eric lipinski, superintendent, arrived at the mine at approximately 6:00 a.m., on sunday, march 8, 2015.  they travelled underground to the 12-east longwall section to evaluate the out-of-seam condition.  matt jarrett, longwall coordinator –east side, arrived on the section shortly afterward.  the necessary supplies arrived on the section and the midnight crew began roof bolting at 7:15 a.m.  they started at the no. 6 shield using a hydraulic z-drill and bolted toward the headgate until relieved by day shift.jason drake, shearer operator, and mike rettinger, longwall utility man, continued roof bolting on day shift.  during the roof bolting process, they attempted to install a 6-foot point anchor bolt (with an expansion shell and two feet of resin) in the face at the no. 4 shield.  the bolt bent as it was inserted in the hole.  when it was removed, the expansion shell was left in the hole.  an attempt to support the face was made in the same hole using a four-foot point anchor bolt with no resin.  this bolt also bent during installation.  the roof bolters were told not to continue installing support in the face since both attempts to install rib bolts into the face were unsuccessful.  however, the roof of the area from no. 6 shield to the headgate was fully roof bolted by approximately 12:00 p.m.ron koontz, director of longwalls for murray energy, arrived at the mine shortly after the start of day shift and traveled to the section.  he was in charge of the blasting work.  the crew began drilling two sets of holes in the mine floor for blasting.  the first set of five holes was drilled in the area near the stage loader and the no. 3 shield.  the second set of six holes was drilled in the area near the no. 5 and no. 6 shields.  the miners were moved outby the longwall face, and the first set of holes were loaded and blasted.  after r. koontz examined the area, the crew returned to the face to shovel.  after approximately five minutes, the decision was made to remove the miners from the area again and blast the second set of holes.  the first two blasts were completed at approximately 1:30 p.m.  the area was examined again by r. koontz, and the crew returned to the face to shovel the blasted material onto the panline.  the crew loaded the face conveyor chain and ran it multiple times to transport the material off the face.the crew continued to drill additional holes in the mine floor for blasting.  a set of five holes and a set of six holes were drilled in the area near the no. 3 and no. 5 shields. the afternoon shift was scheduled to blast these holes upon arrival on the section.  lipinski, e. koontz, and r. koontz left the 12-east longwall at 2:30 p.m. to meet with 
brian hennebert, longwall production foreman, mike kozak, assistant director of longwalls for murray energy, and garloch to discuss plans for the afternoon shift.    garloch then traveled underground to the 14-west longwall where the mine’s other longwall was being moved.  his plans were to check on the longwall move and then travel to 12-east longwall to assist with correcting the out-of-seam condition.kozak and hennebert rode into the mine with the afternoon shift crew and arrived on the 12-east longwall at approximately 4:30 p.m.  kozak was in charge of the blasting work on afternoon shift and he informed the crew of the plan to blast the coal between the panline and the face.  the crew was moved outby the longwall face so the holes drilled by day shift could be loaded and blasted.  the two blasts were made at approximately 5:30 p.m.  kozak examined the area and the crew returned to the face to shovel.  a crack was observed in the face near the area of no.5 shield.  while the crew shoveled the blasted material onto the panline, the face conveyor chain was loaded and ran multiple times to transport the material off the face. the crew began drilling more holes for additional blasting.  two sets of five holes were drilled at an angle underneath the panline in the area between the no. 2 to no. 6 shields. the crew was moved outby the longwall face between 7:45 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., so the holes could be loaded and blasted.  at this time, garloch arrived on the 12-east longwall.  after the two blasts were made, hennebert, kozak, garloch, and richard miller, maintenance foreman, went to examine the face area.the area was examined by kozak, determined to be safe, and the miners traveled back to the longwall face to continue work.  charles neitzelt, shearer operator, and hennebert jack hammered under the panline at the edge of the no. 3 and no. 4 shields to remove the coal.  the remaining crew members shoveled the blasted material from the no. 2 to no. 6 shields onto the panline.  ken torac, loader operator; colby yarbrough, miner bolter; and chris cox, rib bolter operator, began installing roof bolts around the no. 7 shield and bolted toward the tailgate.at approximately 8:55 p.m., shortly after running shoveled material off the face conveyor chain, a piece of coal and rock fell from the face between the no. 4 and no. 6 shield, striking garloch, hennebert, neitzelt, and josh roth, shuttle car operator.  the material was approximately 10 feet long, five feet wide, and up to two feet thick.  roth, who was standing at the edge of the no. 5 and no. 6 shield, was struck in the left shoulder and knocked to the ground.  a piece of the material pinned his leg, but it was quickly removed by crew members standing nearby.  neitzelt and hennebert were knocked to the ground and pinned by the fallen material.  coworkers freed neitzelt and hennebert when kozak and john beattie, faceman, noticed that garloch was under the rock.  kozak, beattie, and other crew members attempted to lift the rock off of garloch, but were unsuccessful.  beattie checked for a pulse, but none was detected.  while they continued to free garloch, other crew members ran outby to retrieve first-aid materials and additional tools to help lift the rock.  the crew members returned to the face with jacks, crib blocks and cap boards.  the rock was raised up with the jacks and blocked, freeing the victim.the victim was placed on a backboard and transported to the mac-8 emergency ride located in the last open crosscut at crosscut #29.  matt remke, longwall shield operator/emergency medical technician (emt), and beattie placed the automated external defibrillator (aed) on garloch’s chest, but no heart rhythms were detected.  the victim was transferred to a rail-mounted mantrip and transported to the cameron portal elevator.  the mantrip was met by chad lucas, emt, who administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) to the victim while on the elevator.  the victim was transported from the mine site by cameron emergency medical services (ems).  dr. katherine langley, m.d. with west virginia university hospital (wvuh) medcom, pronounced the victim dead at 9:45 p.m., while in transport to reynolds memorial hospital in glen dale, west virginia."

Mine Foreman\nStanley Popich……………………………… Manager of Safety and HealthThe Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed a regular safety and health inspection (E01) at this min on February 18, 2015. The Non-Fatal Days Lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for this mine during the period of January through December 2014 was 3.10, compared to a national rate of 3.28 for this type of mine.\xa0', 'DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On Friday February 20, 2015, the daylight shift crew for the A Mains Section (MMU 001-0) travelled underground at 6:00 a.m in a diesel-powered mantrip to the section. \xa0The section crew arrived on the A Mains Section at approximately 6:30 a.m. \xa0After they arrived, Jeremy Mumau, Section Foreman, conducted an onshift examination of the faces and the rest of the crew conducted pre-operational examinations of the mining equipment. \xa0Arron Mumau and Trimble were the normal operators for the roof bolting machine on the A Mains Section.The roof bolting machine was located in the face area of the number 3 entry, which was not fully bolted when they arrived on the section (see Appendix A).\xa0 After performing the pre-operational examination, A. Mumau and Trimble finished bolting the number 3 entry. \xa0The continuous mining machine operator, Jim Frantz, mined 10 feet in the number 4 entry, and then trammed the mining machine into the number 2 entry.\xa0 A. Mumau and Trimble trammed the roof bolting machine from the number 3 entry to the number 4 entry. \xa0They began installing roof bolts in the number 4 entry while Frantz mined 10 feet from the face of number 2 entry.\nFrantz finished mining in number 2 entry and trammed the mining machine into the number 3 entry to trim bottom to build and install bridges. \xa0A. Mumau and Trimble finished bolting the number 4 entry and trammed the roof bolting machine from the number 4 entry into the number 2 entry (see Appendix B).In the number 2 entry, A. Mumau and Trimble installed one row of roof bolts as the primary roof supports and one row of cable bolts as supplemental roof supports.\xa0 There was approximately 10 feet between the last full row of bolts and the face in the number 2 entry. \xa0A. Mumau trammed the roof bolting machine inby and positioned the ATRS with the inby edge of the ATRS pads 5 feet inby the last full row of roof supports.At approximately 2:05 p.m., Trimble was positioned between the roof bolting machine drill mast and the ATRS. \xa0Witnesses stated that Trimble was attaching support wire to the previously installed wire roof screen and the piece of wire roof screen that would be installed. \xa0A large piece of roof rock that measured 0.25 to 1.3 feet in thickness, 3 feet in width, and 11.5 feet in length, fell from the roof. \xa0The rock fell in such a manner that the ATRS could not prevent the rock from hitting Trimble. \xa0The edge of the rock closest to Trimble struck and pinned him in an upright position against the roof bolting machine drill canopy.A. Mumau was operating the left side of the roof bolting machine.\xa0 He was looking toward the rear of the machine to ensure that the rear was not dragging on the bottom when he heard the rock fall.\xa0 A. Mumau turned around to find Trimble pinned by a rock against the drill canopy. \xa0A. Mumua rushed outby shouting for help.\xa0 J. Mumau and scoop operators Paul Polenik and Cody Engle were loading a bridge conveyor onto a scoop just outby the last open crosscut in the number 2 entry.\xa0J. Mumau went to the roof bolting machine and returned to the last open crosscut to tell Polenik and Engle to not go to the accident scene because of the extent of the victim’s injuries.\xa0 He also instructed Engle to go to the intake entry and notify Barry Houser, Mine Foreman, about the accident. \xa0Jeremiah Blake, Utility Man, was helping Frantz hang the continuous mining machine trailing cable in the number 4 entry when they heard shouting.\xa0 They went to the number 2 entry, where J. Mumau stopped them and told them to go to the intake with the rest of the crew.Engle placed the call to the surface. \xa0Paul Sieczkowski, Mine Clerk, received the call and told Houser that a man was hit by a rock. \xa0Houser took the phone and asked about the extent of Trimble’s injuries.\xa0 Cody responded that he believed Trimble was dead. \xa0Houser told Sieczkowski to notify MSHA and the State. \xa0Thomas (Sammy) Bassaro, Mine Examiner, had completed his preshift examination and was on the surface. \xa0He followed Houser to the section on a mantrip.Justin Rebuck, Second Shift Section Foreman, arrived on the section.\xa0 J. Mumau told him about the accident. \xa0Houser arrived, went to the accident scene, and walked outby to tell Bassaro to get a hydraulic pump jack from his mantrip. \xa0Bassaro returned and gave the pump jack to Houser. \xa0Houser boarded the roof bolting machine and set the pump jack against the roof bolting machine and the fallen rock. He used the jack to free the victim.Houser, Rebuck, and J. Mumau transported the victim to the number 4 entry. \xa0They placed him onto a mantrip and transported him to the surface.\xa0 Jerry L. Overman Jr., Coroner, and Steve Alexander, Deputy Coroner, arrived at the mine site where Overman pronounced the victim dead at 4:30 p.m.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'At 2:19 p.m. on February 20, 2015, Sieczkowski notified the MSHA call center of the accident. \xa0The call center notified Deborah Moberg, the District Manager’s Secretary, of the accident at 2:38 p.m. \xa0David Weakland, Indiana Field Office Supervisor, issued a verbal 103(j) order to the mine operator at 3:00 p.m.\xa0 Richard Gray, Kittanning Field Office Supervisor; John Burda, Roof Control Specialist; James Miller, Coal Mine Inspector; Kerry Miller, Roof Control Specialist and Lead Accident Investigator; and Michael Gauna, Mining Engineer from MSHA’s Approval and Certification Center (AC&C), were notified and dispatched to the mine.\xa0Gray, Burda, and J. Miller arrived at the mine and obtained preliminary statements from persons with knowledge of the facts and circumstances concerning the accident. \xa0Gray began reviewing mine tracking information.\xa0 Training records were requested and obtained from the mine operator. \xa0K. Miller, Lead accident Investigator, arrived and modified the 103(j) order to a 103(k) order to ensure the safety of all persons during the accident investigation and to preserve all evidence at the accident scene.Witness interviews were conducted on February 20, 2015, at the Heilwood Mine training area with persons that had knowledge of the facts and circumstances of the accident. \xa0The MSHA investigators traveled underground along with inspectors from the Pennsylvania State Bureau of Mine Safety and mine officials. \xa0Investigators photographed the accident scene and took measurements of the area and the roof bolting machine.Additional interviews were conducted on February 23, 2015, with all roof bolters.\xa0 MSHA personnel also conducted second interviews with J. Mumau, Houser, and A. Mumau.A list of the persons who participated in the investigation and those who were interviewed is contained in Appendix C.DiscussionAccident Scene\xa0\nThe accident occurred in the number 2 slope entry, approximately 170\xa0feet inby survey station number 4794 in the A Mains section, MMU 001-0.\xa0\xa0The mining height at the accident scene averaged 8.3 feet and the width of the number 2 entry was 19 feet.\xa0\xa0The immediate mine floor consisted of gray shale, with pockets of shale bedding that were broken out forming undulations in the mine floor. \xa0The mine ribs were in good condition, showing no signs of sloughage and consisted of shale partings throughout the mining height.The last section of wire roof screen installed was not square with the number 2 entry.\xa0 The left side of the wire roof screen extended 20 inches inby the last row of permanent roof supports.\xa0 The right side of the wire roof screen panel extended 52 inches inby the last row of permanent roof supports.\xa0 Immediately outby, in the region above the roof bolting machine, steel channels with fully grouted bolts were installed where the spacing between each bolt ranged from 3.2 to 3.8 feet.\xa0 Channels with the vertical cable bolts were positioned between the channels installed with fully grouted roof bolts.The rock that struck Trimble was found leaning against the main support of the ATRS, on the right side drill canopy and the other end on the mine floor with the inby edge approximately 5 inches outby the back edge of the ATRS.\xa0 The placement of the rock suggests that the rock did not contact the ATRS.\xa0 The rock measured 0.25 to 1.3 feet in thickness, 3 feet in width, and 11.5 feet in length. \xa0The rock weighed approximately 4,400 pounds. \xa0The rock was shaped similar to a parallelogram.The roof bolting machine had not been moved when accident investigators arrived at the scene.\xa0 A pump jack was installed between the top of the drill canopy and the rock to free the victim.\xa0 The piece of wire roof screen that the victim and A. Mumau were preparing to install measured 5 feet wide by 14 feet in length.Geological Conditions on the A Mains SectionOverburden at the accident site was approximately 690 feet.\xa0 No undermining or over mining with older workings exists in the vicinity of the slope.\xa0 The number 2 entry had been developed to the top of the Brookville Seam but had not yet reached the coal. \xa0Weak bedding contacts are where layers of roof strata may separate from each other. \xa0A 15 percent downward entry slope formed ledges in the roof as a result of the relatively horizontal bedding. \xa0Because of the weak bedding contacts, as the mining cut is advanced down slope, roof stratum can peel away from other roof stratum until the roof strata is sufficiently thick enough to remain intact and not peel away.In this manner, ledges or brows are formed in the roof. \xa0The accident site where roof bolting was being conducted was in such a transition zone as the bolting was advancing towards a ledge in the mining cut. \xa0The mine roof where roof bolts had been installed, the mine roof was the bottom of an overlying gray shale bed. \xa0A general lack of continuous mining machine cutting bit marks in this roof for the last 8-foot distance of roof support installation indicated that the underlying gray shale bed easily peeled away from the overlying shale bed at the contact.Inby the last installed roof support, a brow ran diagonally across the entry towards the inby right hand corner of the cut at roughly a 10° angle to the last installed roof support.\xa0 After the accident, the bottom exposed portion of the brow where the roof remained intact and where it was initially cut began roughly 4.5 feet from the left side rib. \xa0The top exposed portion of the brow where it was in contact with the overlying shale bed began roughly 6 feet from the left pillar rib (see Appendix D).\xa0 The exposed surface of the brow, in the right side half of the entry, dipped inby towards the end of the cut at roughly 55° from horizontal, forming a roughly 2.5-foot wide exposed face that was created by the fallen rock.Roof Control Plan and Addendum at Time of Accident\nThe last fully revised and consolidated roof control plan for this mine was approved on September 18, 2013.\xa0 A slope addendum was approved on September 17, 2014, for the procedures and precautions for development of three slopes from the lower Kittanning seam (B Seam) to the Brookville coal seam (A Seam).\xa0 The plan permitted a maximum mining width of 20 feet and required the roof to be supported with fully-grouted roof bolts at least 48 inches long in normal mining conditions.\xa0 The slope plan required the roof to be supported with fully-grouted roof bolts at least 72 inches long with stipulations that when encountering coal seams, bed separations, defective roof conditions, an obvious or predominant slip, or a visible clay vein fault, supplemental roof support will be installed.The maximum cut depth was limited to 20 feet in the slope plan.\xa0 The maximum cut depth listed in the approved roof control plan was limited to 30 feet due to adverse roof conditions in the Lower Kittanning coal seam.\xa0 At the time of the accident, the mine operator had limited the cut depth to 10 feet because of adverse roof conditions and anticipated mining into the Brookville seam.\xa0 The Brookville seam had been mined in 2 of the 3 entries.\xa0 At the time of the accident the mine was in compliance with all measurements and distances required by the roof control plan slope addendum.Roof Bolting Practices at this Mine\nThe primary roof supports on this section consisted of 6-foot long, fully grouted resin bolts, ¾ inches in diameter with a steel grade of “60” installed through a minimum T-3 channel. \xa0The roof bolts were on a bolt pattern, with a maximum of 4 feet between bolts, a minimum of 4 bolts per row, and a maximum of 4 feet between rows. \xa0The T-3 channel is a ribbed steel strap, 6-inch wide, up to approximately 18 feet long, that has holes through which roof bolts are installed.\xa0Between the primary supports, the operator was installing a row of supplemental roof supports. This consisted of cable bolts, truss bolts, and extra channels.\xa0 The operator installed the primary supports on 4 foot by 4 foot spacing, then backed the roof bolting machine up 2 feet to install the supplemental supports. \xa0The primary and supplemental support rows consisted of 6 bolts in each row.\xa0 The primary and the supplemental supports were spaced apart on maximum 2 foot by 4 foot spacing, with the bolts installed on ends close to the ribs and approximately 2 feet from ribs. \xa0The sections of wire roof screen were either contacting each other or overlapped with the supports installed through the screen.Roof Bolting Machine\nThe equipment involved in the accident was a DDR-Dual Head, Mast Feed Roof\xa0 Drill, twin head roof bolting machine, model DDR-13-B, serial number 2011019, MSHA approval number 2G -2956A-6, manufactured by J.H. Fletcher and Company. \xa0This machine has drill station canopies equipped with vertical slider extensions and also has angle drilling capability. \xa0The ATRS system is an “L” style “T” bar with one ATRS pad in the middle and one on each end.\xa0 Each ATRS outer pads measured 16 inches long by 12 inches wide and the middle pad measured 18 inches long by 12 inches wide. This system was fitted with vertical extensions for the pads that measured 12 inches, and the middle extension measured 18 inches.The width of the ATRS system is manually adjustable with four pin selections on each side, each six inches apart and measured 12 feet and 2 inches at the time of the accident. The pins were located in the second slot from the outside.Testing was performed on the ATRS by AC&C.\xa0 Although not a factor in the accident, the lack of a pre-charge in the hydraulic accumulator and the high leakage rate of the check valve increased the likelihood that the ATRS would not provide proper roof support during a roof bolting cycle longer than 20 minutes.\xa0 A non-contributing citation was issued for this condition. \xa0\xa0The investigation revealed that at the time of the accident the middle extension of the ATRS beam was flipped forward in the stowed position.\xa0 The ATRS articulated beam was positioned at a relatively flat and level area of the mine roof.\xa0 With this roof geometry, and the outside two pads having the 12 inch extensions in place, the original middle pad could not contact the mine roof.\xa0 Only the two outside pads were in contact with the mine roof, with approximately a 9.5-foot distance between the inside edges of the two outer pads.\xa0 As previously stated, the rock fell between the ATRS and the last full row of roof supports and ATRS did not contact the rock that fell. \xa0A non-contributing citation was issued for this condition.Wire Roof Screen Installation Procedure\nDuring the accident investigation interview process, it was discovered that the wire roof screen installation was not being conducted in a consistent manner by all roof bolters.\xa0 Four of the seven roof bolters stated that they walked in front of the drill mast to install support wire and felt that it was acceptable, since they said they were under the ATRS at all times.\xa0 However, during reenactment of the accident, it was determined, that the distance from the outby edge of the ATRS to the drill mast ranged from 18 to 22 inches.\xa0 At the time of the accident, the right hand canopy was approximately 4.3 feet off the mine floor and the left side canopy was approximately 4.5 feet off the mine floor.\xa0 The drill station canopies were lowered to place the wire roof screen on top of the canopies for installation.\xa0 This practice causes the drill station canopies to not be in a position to protect the roof bolters from potential roof hazards while positioning the wire roof screen. \xa0As a result of the investigation, the mine’s roof control plan, was revised to include a safer means of installing wire roof screen.Experience and TrainingTrimble received his Pennsylvania Underground Miner Certification on March 7, 2012. \xa0Based on records obtained from Rosebud Mining, Inc., Trimble had 3 years and 44 weeks of mining experience. \xa0He began working at the Heilwood Mine 1 year and 12 weeks prior to the accident and worked the entire time as a roof bolter helper.On November 18, 2013, Trimble received experienced miner training at the Heilwood Mine. \xa0Trimble received task training for the roof bolting machine for the A Mains Section, on October 29, 2014. \xa0On February 2, 2015 Trimble received annual refresher training.\xa0 No deficiencies for the victim’s training were found.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'A root cause analysis was conducted to identify the causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \xa0Listed below are root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions implemented to prevent a reoccurrence of the accident.Root Cause:\xa0The mine operator failed to prevent miners from working in an area that was not adequately supported or otherwise controlled to prevent hazards from falling roof.\xa0 The roof bolting machine operators were allowed to position themselves between the drill mast and the ATRS, with the drill station canopies lowered, while positioning the roof screen.\nCorrective Actions:\nWhen welded wire mesh is being installed in conjunction with roof bolts:\nMesh panels will be positioned on the machine only while the machine is positioned under fully supported roof,\nMesh panels will be positioned over the drill stations and secured to the machine using at least two points of contact (e.g., drill steels raised through the mesh, wire/cable ties passed through the mesh and secured through holes in the ATRS pads, or mesh clamps affixed to the ATRS bar or pads).\nIf the mesh is dislodged as the bolting machine is trammed inby or as the ATRS is raised, the machine must be trammed outby under supported roof to reposition the panel.\nIt is also acceptable to install mesh panels over fully supported roof; in this application bolt length may be less than the minimum 6 ft length minimum prescribed in #1 above.\n< >The approved Roof Control Plan was revised to provide safer wire roof screen installation procedures and ATRS procedures during slope development. \xa0\xa0All affected miners were trained in these procedures.ATRS procedures\nThe ATRS Raise Control lever must be engaged for 5 seconds after the ATRS pads contact the roof and the corresponding gage must be observed to ensure that a minimum set pressure of 800 to 1,100 psi is achieved.\nWhen bolting, the maximum distance between the outby edge of the ATRS pads and the last row of permanent supports shall not exceed 5 ft. \xa0The ATRS shall not be more than 18” from the center of the hole being drilled.\nThe distance from the ATRS to each rib must not exceed 5 ft. \xa0If due to unusual conditions, the distance between the ATRS and the rib exceeds 5 ft., the bolting machine must be positioned within 5 ft. of the rib on one side to allow safe installation of one bolt on that side while the off side operator remains in a permanently supported area.\xa0 Subsequent to bolt installation, the machine can be repositioned to complete the bolt row.\nWire roof screen installation procedures\n4.

and health inspection (E01) on December 16, 2014. \xa0An E01 inspection started on January 5, 2015, was ongoing at the time of the accident.\xa0 The Non-Fatal Days Lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for the mine in 2014 was 6.73, compared to an NFDL rate of 3.27 for mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On January 28, 2015, Rick Kline (victim) began the afternoon shift at approximately 2:30 p.m. with the rest of the Lebeau Mains production crew. \xa0The production crew consisted of Jamie Houston, Corey Marcum, Joseph Lubniewski, Shane Kennedy, Roof Bolters; Korey Harbaugh, Austin Matsko, Shuttle Car Operators; Dave Sipes, Scoop Operator; Eugene Horner, Mechanic; Troy Kunrod, Section Foreman, and Kline, who was the only continuous mining machine operator. \xa0All of the production crew members except Horner, traveled to the section at the start of the shift. \xa0Horner arrived on the section later than the other crew members. \xa0Kline operated the continuous mining machine and mined the No. 3 entry, mined a crosscut from No. 3 entry to No. 2 entry, and mined the No. 2 and No. 7 entries.\xa0 After the No. 7 entry was mined, Kline moved the mining machine to the No.6 entry to load the rock that fell in the face area. \xa0Houston and Marcum finished bolting the No. 5 entry and then backed the roof bolting machine into the last open crosscut from the No. 5 entry to No. 6 entry, and waited for Kline to back the mining machine out of the No. 6 entry (see Appendix A).Kline finished loading the rock and then began moving the mining machine from the No. 6 entry to the No. 5 entry.\xa0 He trammed the mining machine in reverse outby the last open crosscut in the No. 6 entry, continuing through the next to last open crosscut, and then just outby this crosscut in the No. 5 entry. \xa0From that point he trammed the mining machine forward towards the face of the No. 5 entry.When he passed the last open crosscut, Kunrod, Houston, and Marcum were behind the ventilation curtain in the crosscut discussing where the roof bolters were going to bolt next.\xa0 They could not see Kline or the mining machine through the ventilation curtain, but they heard the mining machine’s scrubber fan start as the mining machine was trammed in the No. 5 entry. \xa0Matsko trammed the No. 4 shuttle car through the last open crosscut from No. 4 entry to No. 5 entry and stopped at the No. 5 entry.While pausing, Matsko heard the scrubber fan running and saw the mining machine’s trailing cable and water line moving inby.\xa0 When he observed the trailing cable and waterline stopped moving, Matsko went to the mining machine and saw Kline pinned between the conveyor boom of the mining machine and the coal rib.\xa0 Kline was facing inby (towards the No. 5 face) with the conveyor boom against the left side of his chest and his right side was against the coal rib. \xa0The mining machine and scrubber fan were running and the nylon sling (rope) around the trailing cable and water line was attached to the conveyor boom.Matsko reached under the conveyor boom and retrieved the remote control box for the mining machine and swung the conveyor boom away to free Kline, turned off the mining machine, and then yelled for Kunrod. \xa0Kunrod, a certified emergency medical technician (EMT), traveled to the accident scene with Houston (EMT) and Marcum. \xa0Kunrod began administering first aid and told Marcum to call 911 and get the backboard and first aid supplies. \xa0Houston assisted Kunrod and began an initial assessment, but could not confirm vital signs. \xa0Marcum told Harbaugh to call outside to tell Colt Kniss, Outside Man, to call 911.\xa0 Marcum obtained the first aid supplies and the backboard and took them to the accident scene. \xa0Harbaugh got the mantrip and backed it up to the continuous mining machine. \xa0Kline was placed on a backboard and was given oxygen.\xa0 The automated external defibrillator (AED) was not used because Kline had a pacemaker.\xa0 He was placed on the mantrip and first aid was administered while he was transported to the surface. \xa0Northern EMS ambulance service and crew members took over first aid care and transported Kline to the Windber Hospital Emergency Room.\xa0 At 7:45 p.m., Kline was pronounced dead by Somerset County Coroner, Wallace Miller, due to blunt force trauma to the chest.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On January 28, 2015, at 7:47 p.m., James Mullen, Superintendent/Mine Foreman notified MSHA that an accident had occurred at the mine. \xa0A citation, that did not contribute to the accident, was issued for a violation of 30 CFR § 50.10 because the mine operator did not notify MSHA immediately, at once, without delay, and within 15 minutes.\xa0 Ron Hixson, MSHA District 2 Assistant District Manager, called Dennis Zeanchock, MSHA Johnstown, Pennsylvania Field Office Supervisor, at approximately 7:50 p.m.\xa0 Zeanchock contacted Dan Gonos, Brubaker Mine Safety Supervisor, and verbally issued a 103(j) order to preserve the accident scene and to prevent the destruction of evidence.Zeanchock then dispatched three MSHA inspectors from the Johnstown field office to begin an accident investigation. \xa0MSHA personnel arrived at the mine at 9:30 p.m. and modified the 103(j) order to a 103(k) order at 9:35 p.m. \xa0The accident investigation was conducted in cooperation with the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mine Safety and the mine operator.\xa0 Persons who participated in the investigation are listed in Appendix B. \xa0Interviews were conducted with ten miners on January 28, 2015, on the surface of the mine, and with four additional miners on February 10, 2015, at the LCT Energy, LP office (see list of persons interviewed in Appendix B). \xa0Preliminary information was collected, including measurements, photographs, and sketches that were made at the accident scene. \xa0The functions and operations of the continuous mining machine were tested at the accident scene and a permissibility inspection was conducted on the mining machine. \xa0The remote control unit and its battery were obtained for examination and tested under laboratory conditions at the Matric facility in Seneca, Pennsylvania.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Accident Scene\xa0\nThe accident occurred in the face area in the No. 5 entry approximately 80 feet inby survey spad No. 2035 in the Lebeau Mains section (MMU 001-0). \xa0This entry was mined 82 feet inby the last open crosscut.\xa0 The entry was approximately 19 feet and 5 inches in width and 50 inches in height. \xa0The roof had permanent roof support installed to the face and no hazardous conditions were observed in the roof and ribs in the area. \xa0The mine roof, ribs, and mine floor were relatively dry.When the investigators arrived to begin the operation and function tests on the continuous mining machine, it was in the same position that it was in at the time of the accident, except that the conveyor boom was in the position that Matsko placed it when he moved it to free Kline. The front right corner of the mining machine was 88 inches outby the face and 35 inches from the right rib facing inby. \xa0The cable anchor point located on the right rear of the mining machine when measured was 7 inches from the right rib. \xa0There was a 5 to 6 foot loop of slack trailing cable and water line along the right rear corner of the mining machine.\xa0 The gathering head (pan) of the mining machine was found in the raised position. \xa0The imprints of the mining machine tracks found on the mine floor extended 5 to 6 feet in front of where the front edge of the tracks were located.\xa0 From all indications, the continuous mining machine was being backed away from the face at the time of the accident.During on site testing, when the continuous mining machine was trammed forward a few feet from its location at the time of the accident, and then trammed back, investigators observed that the mine floor was uneven under the mining machine.\xa0 The uneven mine floor caused the front and back of the mining machine to rock up and down.\xa0 At this point, when investigators operated the tracks in opposite directions, the mining machine pivoted and turned very easily and very quickly.Equipment\nThe remote controlled continuous mining machine involved in the accident was manufactured by Joy Global Inc.\xa0 The model number is 14CM09-11AX, the serial number is JM6803, MSHA approval number 2G–4159A–00, and the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mine Safety approval number is BFE-0031-08. \xa0The remote control unit being used at the time of the accident was manufactured by Matric Ltd.\xa0 The part number is 100510082, serial number is 172205AP019, and the MSHA approval number is 2G-4096-0.During functional operation testing of the continuous mining machine performed on January 29, 2015, the stabilizer jack was inoperable.\xa0 The stabilizer jack is used to raise the back of the mining machine up and /or to stabilize the mining machine during the process of mining. \xa0\xa0Also, the conveyor gathering head had no float function, unless the selector switch on the remote was held continuously to activate the solenoid on the valve bank.\xa0 These conditions existed because\xa0the mine operator changed the configuration of the valve bank wiring and hydraulic hosing.\xa0 A noncontributing citation was issued for these conditions.All of the other functions tested during the functional operation testing of the continuous mining machine operated properly.On February 5, 2015, accident investigators inspected the permissibility of the continuous mining machine.\xa0 The right headlight lens was broken and the guard protecting it was missing two bolts. \xa0All of the lights were working. \xa0Illumination in the area was not a contributing factor to the accident.\xa0 No reflective tape was on the rear of the continuous mining machine.\xa0 A red reflector measuring 3 ½ inches by 2 inches, and yellow reflective tape measuring 1 ¾ inch by 2 ¼ inch located on the right side of the conveyor boom, were approximately 5 feet from the rear of the continuous miner.\xa0 A noncontributing citation was issued for these conditions.The remote control unit to operate the mining machine was the only unit present on the Lebeau Mains section (MMU 001-0). \xa0This remote has a unique identification code that is paired with the continuous mining machine to eliminate the possibility of cross activation by other radio frequencies.\xa0 The remote control unit testing and examination was done at the Matric facility in Seneca, PA.\xa0 The MSHA Approval and Certification Center (A&CC) participated in this testing.\xa0 Testing at Matric Ltd. did not reveal any performance deficiencies with the unit.Examinations\nThe preshift examination was conducted and no hazardous conditions were recorded.\xa0 Kunrod performed an inadequate on-shift examination on the shift that the accident occurred.\xa0 Kunrod stated that no hazards existed, however, investigators found significant ventilation (improper air flow), rock dust (total incombustible content), and loose rib hazards.\xa0 A 104(d) citation and 104(d) order were issued for these violations which were noncontributory to the accident.Training and Experience\nKline had 9 years and 1 week of underground mining experience, with 4 years and 9 weeks as a continuous mining machine operator, and 23 weeks of experience at this mine. \xa0Kline had a miner’s certificate of Qualification and Machine Operator’s Certificate from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.The mine operator could not produce records of Underground Experienced Miner Training.\xa0 Also, the mine operator had no records of Task Training for the miners.\xa0 Noncontributory citations were issued to the mine operator.During interviews, Gonos stated that the experienced miner training for the victim was never documented.\xa0 Rick Huff, Midnight Shift Section Foreman, stated that task training records were stored on the working section on the section power center with other records.\xa0 Huff stated that the training records got wet and were discarded.\nHuff stated that he task trained Kline on the Joy 14CM continuous mining machine, but then admitted that he didn’t know if he had even been trained on a Joy 14CM mining machine himself.\xa0 Management was aware that Kline was not trained by a qualified trainer, or a supervisor experienced in the assigned tasks, or other person experienced in the assigned tasks as required by 30 CFR § 48.7(e).\xa0 However, Huff stated that he discussed the hazards of red zones with Kline.\xa0 Although the victim was an experienced continuous mining machine operator, a noncontributory citation was issued to the mine operator for task training.Roof Control Plan\nThe approved roof control plan in effect at the time of the accident contains the following statement\xa0on page 15, under the heading “Safety Precautions for Operating Remote Control Continuous Mining Machine and ATRS Roof Bolter using Haulage or Shuttle Cars.” \xa0During mining and the place changing with remote-control miners, no person shall position themselves where they can be contacted by the miner during the mining or tramming process.The intent is to prevent the hazardous exposure of all persons in the working place from dangers associated with roof hazards and the movement of mining equipment.Kline positioned himself where he was contacted by the continuous mining machine that he was tramming with a remote-control unit. \xa0The mine operator’s administrative controls, policies, and training in place at the time of the accident were not adequate to ensure that the safety precautions in the approved roof control plan were being followed.\xa0 The mine operator also had no commercially available proximity detection systems installed on the continuous mining machines being used at the mine.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'An analysis was conducted to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 During the analysis, root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.\xa0\nListed below are root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions implemented to prevent a recurrence of the accident:Root Cause: The provisions of the approved roof control plan to prevent the hazards associated with the movement of mining equipmentwere not followed.\nCorrective Action: The mine operator has implemented the following written procedures:\nNo one will walk in close proximity of the continuous mining machine when tramming.\nThe continuous mining machine pump motor will be de-energized when loading or unloading\xa0miner cable.\nA spotter will be used to assist the mining machine operator to move the continuous mining machine from place to place, setting up to mine coal and moving into and out of the cut.\nWhen tramming the continuous mining machine into a fresh cut, with the assistance of a spotter, the operator will tram the machine in on the left side of the cut, de-energize the machine, drop the cable and set the mining machine up to begin mining as required on the air side.\nThe company established a written plan to install the Strata proximity detection system on all the continuous mining machines the company currently owns beginning with the mining machine involved in this accident. \xa0All miners will receive proper training on the proximity system, prior to their exposure to the system.', 'CONCLUSION': '\xa0The continuous mining machine operator received fatal crushing injuries when he was caught between the continuous mining machine and the coal rib. \xa0The accident occurred because the victim operated (trammed) the machine, while located between the right side of the conveyor boom and the coal rib, in violation of the approved roof control plan.\xa0 The mine operator’s administrative controls, training, and policies in place at the time of the accident were not adequate to prevent the practice of operating continuous mining machines from an unsafe location. \xa0Approved By:\n_________________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 _________________\xa0\nThomas E.

victim was walking across the No. 6 unit when he was struck by a coal hauler.The accident occurred because management failed to provide adequate engineering controls, administrative controls, and acceptable work practices, to protect miners from the hazards of being struck by mobile equipment.\xa0 \xa0', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'The Highland 9 Mine, I.D. 15-02709, is located in Waverly, Union County, Kentucky on French Road, approximately two miles west of US HWY 60. \xa0At the time of the accident, the mine employed 474 people, of which 450 worked underground. \xa0The mine is accessed via an intake slope. \xa0The mine also has one intake and two return air shafts. \xa0The mine is ventilated by two exhausting main fans, which are connected to the mine via vertical shaft openings from the coal seam to the surface. \xa0The mine operates 3 shifts per day, 6 days a week in the KY No. 9 coal seam. \xa0The seam averages 5½ feet in height.\xa0 The mine produces 24,000 tons per day during two ten-hour production shifts and one eight-hour maintenance shift. \xa0The miners are represented by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA).\xa0\nCoal is extracted from the working faces with Joy continuous mining machines using battery-powered coal haulers and Flexible Conveyor Trains (FCT) to a conveyor belt that carries coal to the surface. \xa0An overland conveyor belt transports the coal from the Highland 9 Mine to the Camp 9 preparation plant where it is processed and then transported by an overland conveyor belt to the Patriot Coal Company Ohio River Terminal.Although there was an ongoing inspection at the time of the accident, the last regular health and safety inspection, E01, by the Mine Safety and Health Administration was completed on September 23, 2014. \xa0The Non-Fatal Days Lost, (NFDL) rate for this mine in 2014, was 6.49. \xa0The NFDL rate for the Nation, for mines of this type in 2014, was 3.27.\nThe principal officers at the Highland 9 Mine at the time of the

Carlisle...........................................Chief Maintenance Supervisor\nRandy Duncan..........................................Safety Director\nAndy Fields..............................................Regional Safety Director, Patriot Coal Corp.', 'DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'Eldridge started his shift on Tuesday, December 16, 2014, at approximately 7:00 a.m. at the Highland 9 Mine. \xa0He attended the morning safety meeting conducted before miners traveled underground. \xa0He then traveled underground at 7:15 a.m., via the slope mantrip with his regular crew. \xa0Eldridge departed from the slope bottom at 7:24 a.m., operating a diesel service truck to the No. 6 section, arriving at the coal producing unit at 7:47 a.m. \xa0This unit is located at the Sixth Panel South off the Third Main East.\xa0 The remainder of the No. 6 unit crew traveled separately on a diesel mantrip to the section, arriving at 7:45 a.m.Neil Caudill, Section Foreman, conducted an examination of the work areas on the unit.\xa0 He determined that work started by the previous shift on ventilation controls and rib support had to be completed before coal production could begin.\xa0 Caudill assigned specific work tasks to miners. \xa0These tasks included completing a brattice (ventilation control) at 3+20 between the No. 5 and No. 6 entries and installing rib bolts in the No. 6 entry, between crosscuts 2+40 and 3+20. \xa0After completion of these tasks, mining on the section began in the No. 6 left entry with the No. 1 left side continuous mining machine.At approximately 8:45 a.m., Eldridge assisted Jim Courtney, Maintenance Foreman and Danny Young, Maintenance Foreman, in repairing the No. 2 continuous mining machine located on the right side of the section. \xa0After repairs were completed, the right side continuous mining machine was moved to the No. 7 right entry.When mining was completed in No. 6 left entry with the No. 1 continuous mining machine, Eldridge and Caudill assisted Brian Looney, Left Side No. 1 Continuous Mining Machine Operator, move the machine to the No. 3 left entry. \xa0Eldridge then changed a defective water spray nozzle in the continuous mining machine drum before leaving the area.The right side No. 2 continuous mining machine then began mining in the No. 7 right entry at approximately 10:35 a.m. Each coal hauler received a load of coal, except the No. 26 coal hauler operated by Wesley Coots. \xa0Coots was parked in the crosscut, between the No. 6 and No. 7 entries at crosscut 4+40, waiting for the No. 27 coal hauler, operated by Patrick Baker, to travel outby before he could pull into the No. 7 entry and proceed to the continuous mining machine (See Appendix C Figure 2).While the coal haulers were waiting, Eldridge walked to the No. 29 coal hauler, operated by David Dukes, and asked if the tire had been changed. \xa0It was learned during the investigation that this tire needed to be replaced due to torn tread. \xa0This had been reported to Eldridge on a prior occasion. \xa0After a brief conversation, Eldridge proceeded through the ventilation curtain and Dukes lost sight of him.\xa0 \xa0Eldridge stopped and sat on the off-side of the No. 26 coal hauler, to ask Coots if he had any problems or oil leaks on his coal hauler. \xa0While Eldridge was sitting and writing notes in his book, the No. 27 coal hauler traveled back toward the dumping point. \xa0Coots told Eldridge that he had to go get a load. \xa0As Eldridge traveled by the battery end of the coal hauler, heading inby in the No. 7 entry, he asked Coots if he was going down (outby) the No. 7 entry. \xa0Coots said he was. \xa0At this point, Coots lost sight of Eldridge and pulled his coal hauler outby in the No. 7 entry. \xa0Coots, then stopped, changed directions, and began traveling inby in the No. 7 entry with loading end first to the No. 2, right side continuous mining machine. \xa0Coots traveled inby approximately 10 feet when he heard an unusual sound. \xa0He immediately stopped the coal hauler using the service brakes. \xa0Realizing that Eldridge had been struck by the coal hauler, Coots began yelling for help.\xa0 Terry Steeley, No. 28 Coal Hauler Operator, and Dukes traveled on foot to the accident scene and saw Eldridge’s leg from beneath the No. 26 coal hauler.Steeley and Coots ran to the mine phone located near the power center and Steeley called outside for help. Carlos Ewing, No. 2 Continuous Mining Machine Operator; Mike Jones, No. 1 Scoop Operator; Shawn Howard, No. 8 Roof Bolting Machine Operator; and Brian Looney arrived at the accident scene. \xa0Dukes asked Looney to go get the section foreman and Brandon LaMond, Production Coordinator, who was already on the section as part of his normal routine. \xa0At approximately 10:58 a.m., Howard checked Eldridge for a pulse and reported to the group that he could not detect a pulse.LaMond and Caudill arrived at the accident scene at approximately 11:05 a.m. \xa0From observation and report of no pulse, they realized Eldridge was deceased.\xa0 \xa0LaMond asked Caudill and the rest of No. 6 unit miners to leave the area. \xa0LaMond went to the mine phone to notify mine management of the accident and to have them call for EMS personnel and notify MSHA.\xa0 At approximately 11:40 a.m. LaMond sent Coots outside with another miner to aid him. \xa0At approximately 11:45 a.m., LaMond, Darrin Browning, Maintenance Foreman, and Young pulled Eldridge from beneath the coal hauler and placed him on a stretcher. \xa0Eldridge was then transported out of the mine. \xa0At 12:23 p.m. Eldridge arrived on the surface and was loaded into the awaiting ambulance.The Union County Coroner determined that the victim died instantly when the accident occurred at 10:55 a.m.\xa0', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'At 11:09 a.m., on Tuesday, December 16, 2014, Andy Fields, Regional Safety Director, Patriot Coal Corp., notified Ron Burns, Technical Assistant District Manager, an accident had occurred at the mine property on the No. 6 unit. \xa0Fields stated that an employee has been hit by a coal hauler and an ambulance was on the way to the mine. \xa0Fields said he did not know the extent of his injuries. At 11:15 a.m., Burns issued a verbal 103(j) order to Fields, to insure the safety of the miners, and to preserve evidence. \xa0Burns dispatched an investigation team to the mine.Jeff Winders, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, was underground at the mine conducting inspections at the time of the accident. \xa0Winders was notified of the accident by mine management at approximately 11:25 a.m. \xa0Winders traveled to the accident scene with Josh Gibson, Highland Safety Department. \xa0After Winders arrived at the accident scene he issued a 103(k) order to Gibson, secured the accident scene, and took pictures and measurements of the accident scene. \xa0The 103(k) order issued by Winders was later vacated because Burns had already issued the 103(j) order.\xa0 The 103(j) order was later modified to a 103(k) order by Carlisle when he arrived at the mine.Various MSHA personnel including Bill Barnwell, Enforcement Assistant District Manager; Curtis Hardison, Field Office Supervisor; and Archie Coburn and Adam Carlisle, Accident Investigators, traveled to the mine. \xa0Carlisle and Coburn, along with inspectors from Kentucky Division of Mine Safety (KDMS) conducted interviews with witnesses of the accident. \xa0The investigation party was comprised of Carlisle, Coburn, Barnwell and Hardison, along with the Kentucky Office of Mine Safety personnel, the company officials, and union representatives of the miners (see Appendix A). \xa0The investigation party traveled underground to begin the scene investigation.On Wednesday, December 17, 2014, Carlisle and Tim Fugate, Chief Accident Investigator, Kentucky Division of Mine Safety, conducted formal interviews of the witnesses at the Kentucky State Office building in Madisonville, Kentucky. \xa0Also present during the formal interviews were representatives of Highland Mining Company, the UMWA, and Malia Holzberger, Solicitor for MSHA (see Appendix B).On December 18, 2014, Carlisle, Coburn, and Abe DeLeon, Supervisory Inspector, returned to the mine to take additional photos of the area and to recreate the accident seen.On December 21, 2014, Carlisle, Coburn, and DeLeon, returned to the mine and accompanied Dustin Hinchman and Justin A. Daniels, Engineers from MSHA Approval and Certification Center. \xa0The group performed an equipment illumination survey and an electrical examination on the coal hauler involved in the accident.DiscussionCoal Haulage\nOn the coal producing units that utilize battery-powered coal haulers, a unique system of haulage is used to facilitate loading and minimize routes of travel. \xa0The coal hauler operator’s seat is on the battery end of the coal hauler. Typically, the coal hauler will travel in the direction of the battery end. \xa0Each coal hauler runs in a circular route that begins at the dumping point and continues to the continuous mining machine where it is loaded with coal and then returns to the dumping point. \xa0The coal is unloaded at the dumping point, and then carried by belt conveyor to the surface. \xa0In this circular route of travel, the coal hauler operator must change the direction of travel prior to receiving or dumping a load of coal. \xa0This puts the machine loading end either at the continuous mining machine to load coal or at the dumping point to unload coal. \xa0To accomplish this task, the coal hauler operator travels through a crosscut, battery end first into the connected entry, turns and then proceeds to the continuous mining machine.\xa0 Once loaded, the operator will tram the coal hauler to the dumping point, battery end first, into a crosscut and back into the entry with the loading/dumping end toward the dumping point (see Appendix C, Figure 1).Accident Scene\nThe accident occurred on the right side of the No. 6 unit (MMU 067-0) in the No. 7 entry, approximately 6 feet inby the inby left corner of crosscut 4+40 (see Appendix C, Figure 3). \xa0The mine floor in the area of the accident scene had irregularities.\xa0 This was created when the continuous mining machine cut into the mine floor when developing the right crosscut. \xa0Although the coal height was 5½ feet, the actual mining height fluctuated up to 84 inches because of loose roof, soft mine floor, and cutting by the continuous mining machine operator. \xa0The uneven floor began in the No. 7 entry intersection at crosscut 4+40 and extended into the right crosscut toward the No. 8 entry. \xa0This uneven floor presented itself as a very large pot hole with sloping side walls. \xa0The hole was sloped from the left to right side in the No. 7 entry, and extended into the right crosscut. \xa0At the location of the accident, the No. 7 entry measured 18’ 6”wide and 7’ in height.When investigators arrived at the accident scene, the No. 26 coal hauler was located in the intersection of the No. 7 entry at crosscut 4+40. \xa0The loading end of the coal hauler was located twenty five inches from the left inby rib (see Appendix C, Figure 4). \xa0The battery end of the coal hauler was angled toward the right outby rib corner into the hole cut in the mine floor. \xa0The right corner of the coal hauler machine batteries were located thirteen inches from the rib corner.The investigators determined the accident occurred as the coal hauler was traveling out of the left crosscut into the No. 7 entry to align the loading end for travel to the continuous mining machine.\nThe coal haulers were traveling through the hole cut into the mine floor in the No. 7 entry intersection. \xa0This caused the machine to tilt to the right on the operator’s side, raising the left corner of the bed as the coal hauler traveled through the intersection (see Appendix D). \xa0The elevated position of the bed contributed to the hazard and limited visibility for the coal hauler operator. \xa0After it was determined that the coal haulers had difficulty passing through the area, further grading was performed in the area of the intersection to reduce the slope of the grade.\xa0 No other corrections had been made to reduce the hazard of reduced visibility in the intersection.Equipment\nThe No. 26 battery-powered coal hauler involved in the accident was manufactured by Caterpillar, model number LAR816, serial number 816-1151 and had MSHA approval number 18-A060013-0. \xa0The coal hauler was put into service at Highland 9 Mine on August 6, 2012, after being transferred from a mine in West Virginia. \xa0The coal hauler measured 38 feet and 10 inches in length, 12 feet wide, and a maximum canopy height of 84 inches.Testing and Examination\nThe No. 26 coal hauler was examined by the investigation team and functional tests of the braking and steering systems were performed at the accident scene. \xa0No operational irregularities or deficiencies were observed or detected during the functional testing.Strobe Light\nInformation obtained during the accident investigation revealed that the victim had a personal strobe light. \xa0The strobe light was attached to the front lower portion of his belt suspenders. \xa0The interviews indicated that the victim did not have his strobe light turned on at the time of the accident. \xa0The strobe light worked properly when it was tested. \xa0During the investigation, it was determined that the location of the victim’s strobe light would have been ineffective to warn the coal hauler operator due to the raised position of the bed when the victim was struck.Previous Accident\nThis fatal accident involving the No. 26 coal hauler is the second serious accident, and the first fatality, where a battery-powered coal hauler was being operated on an active mining section at the Highland 9 Mine. \xa0The first injury accident occurred on December 5, 2013, when a miner, while walking beside a de-energized coal hauler, walked through a ventilation curtain where the coal hauler was parked beneath the curtain. \xa0Not realizing that the miner on foot had not cleared the coal hauler, the coal hauler operator started the coal hauler and engaged the steering, which pinned the miner between the machine’s bed and coal rib, breaking his leg.Training and Experience\nEldridge had 15 years of underground mining experience. \xa0Eldridge received his Kentucky underground mining card on July 8, 1999. \xa0He received his Kentucky underground mine foreman certification on October 28, 2010. \xa0He had also received his electrical worker certification from the State of Kentucky. \xa0A non-contributory citation was issued to the mine for not having a record showing that Eldridge had received task training as a unit repairman. \xa0An examination of the company training records indicated Eldridge last received the required 8-hour annual refresher training for underground miners on November 18, 2014. \xa0Eldridge had been employed at the Highland No. 9 mine for 35 weeks. \xa0He received his mine specific training on March 17, 2014.Coots earned his underground miners certification on September 21, 2004. \xa0He had 8 years of underground mining experience at the time of the accident. \xa0Coots began his employment at Highland Mine on December 16, 2013, and received his mine specific training December 16, 2013. \xa0Coots’ received annual refresher training for underground miners on November 11, 2014.The investigation revealed that the mine had no record of the required task training on the safe operation of the coal hauler. \xa0After questioning Coots, the section foreman, and other miners on the section, it was determined that Coots had been task trained properly on the coal hauler and had demonstrated that he could operate that piece of equipment safely. \xa0Coots had been the operator of a coal hauler for approximately 2 months on this section, at the time of the accident. \xa0Coots had previous coal hauler and shuttle car operating experience on other sections at Highland 9 Mine as well as at other coal mines.\xa0 A citation was issued for the mine operator not having a record of task training for Coots. \xa0Also, a citation was issued to the mine operator for seven other miners assigned to the section for not having a record of task training.\xa0 These citations were considered non-contributory to the accident.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'An analysis was conducted to identify the underlying cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \xa0Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corrective actions implemented to prevent recurrence of the accident.Root Cause: The mine operator did not have effective engineering controls, policies, programs, or procedures to protect miners on the working section from the hazards of being struck by battery-powered coal haulers and the mine operator had not trained the miners on engineering controls, policies, or procedures.Corrective Actions:\xa0Commercially available and permissible engineering controls, such as proximity detection devices, cameras, or other engineering controls, will be installed on the coal haulers to protect the miner from the hazards of battery-powered haulage equipment operating on the working sections.\xa0 The miners will be trained on the installed engineering controls.Root Cause: The mine operator did not have effective policies, programs, or procedures that assure all miners properly utilize the personal strobe light issued to the miners and that the miners were trained.Corrective Actions:\xa0All miners will be provided a personal strobe light. \xa0The strobe lights shall be worn when traveling by foot inby the loading point on all working sections. \xa0The strobe light shall be positioned on the rear of the miners’ hard hat or the upper third of the miners back to ensure maximum visibility. \xa0The strobe lights shall be turned on while miners are traveling by foot inby the tail piece and shall be properly maintained at all times. \xa0All miners were trained on the use of personal strobe lights.Root Cause: \xa0The mine operator did not have effective policies, programs, or procedures that assure all miners on the working section had an effective means to communicate their presence on the unit, intended activities, and routes of travel and that the miners were trained.Corrective Actions:\xa0The mine operator provided all miners working or traveling inby the loading point\xa0with two-way radiosto use to communicate their presence on the unit, their intended activities, and route of travel.\xa0 All miners were trained in the use of the two-way radios.Root Cause:\xa0The mine operator did not have effective policies, programs, or procedures that assure all miners on the working section operating mobile equipment adequately communicated to other miners their intentions to move the equipment or change direction of travel and that the miners were trained.Corrective Actions:The mine operator has instituted a policy that all rubber-tired equipment operators on the working section shall sound an audible warning device before tramming the equipment in any direction. \xa0All affected miners were trained on the use of the audible warning devices established by the mine operator for use.\xa0', 'CONCLUSION': 'The accident occurred because the mine operator failed to provide adequate engineering controls, administrative controls, and acceptable work practices to protect miners from the hazards of being struck by mobile equipment.In addition, the mine operator failed to maintain the condition of the mine floor free of preventable bottom irregularities. \xa0The bottom irregularities present in the intersection of the No. 7 entry greatly reduced the coal hauler operator’s field of view, until the coal hauler was clear of the bottom irregularities.\xa0Approved

tuesday, december 16, 2014, at approximately 7:00 a.m. at the highland 9 mine.  he attended the morning safety meeting conducted before miners traveled underground.  he then traveled underground at 7:15 a.m., via the slope mantrip with his regular crew.  eldridge departed from the slope bottom at 7:24 a.m., operating a diesel service truck to the no. 6 section, arriving at the coal producing unit at 7:47 a.m.  this unit is located at the sixth panel south off the third main east.  the remainder of the no. 6 unit crew traveled separately on a diesel mantrip to the section, arriving at 7:45 a.m.neil caudill, section foreman, conducted an examination of the work areas on the unit.  he determined that work started by the previous shift on ventilation controls and rib support had to be completed before coal production could begin.  caudill assigned specific work tasks to miners.  these tasks included completing a brattice (ventilation control) at 3+20 between the no. 5 and no. 6 entries and installing rib bolts in the no. 6 entry, between crosscuts 2+40 and 3+20.  after completion of these tasks, mining on the section began in the no. 6 left entry with the no. 1 left side continuous mining machine.at approximately 8:45 a.m., eldridge assisted jim courtney, maintenance foreman and danny young, maintenance foreman, in repairing the no. 2 continuous mining machine located on the right side of the section.  after repairs were completed, the right side continuous mining machine was moved to the no. 7 right entry.when mining was completed in no. 6 left entry with the no. 1 continuous mining machine, eldridge and caudill assisted brian looney, left side no. 1 continuous mining machine operator, move the machine to the no. 3 left entry.  eldridge then changed a defective water spray nozzle in the continuous mining machine drum before leaving the area.the right side no. 2 continuous mining machine then began mining in the no. 7 right entry at approximately 10:35 a.m. each coal hauler received a load of coal, except the no. 26 coal hauler operated by wesley coots.  coots was parked in the crosscut, between the no. 6 and no. 7 entries at crosscut 4+40, waiting for the no. 27 coal hauler, operated by patrick baker, to travel outby before he could pull into the no. 7 entry and proceed to the continuous mining machine (see appendix c figure 2).while the coal haulers were waiting, eldridge walked to the no. 29 coal hauler, operated by david dukes, and asked if the tire had been changed.  it was learned during the investigation that this tire needed to be replaced due to torn tread.  this had been reported to eldridge on a prior occasion.  after a brief conversation, eldridge proceeded through the ventilation curtain and dukes lost sight of him.   eldridge stopped and sat on the off-side of the no. 26 coal hauler, to ask coots if he had any problems or oil leaks on his coal hauler.  while eldridge was sitting and writing notes in his book, the no. 27 coal hauler traveled back toward the dumping point.  coots told eldridge that he had to go get a load.  as eldridge traveled by the battery end of the coal hauler, heading inby in the no. 7 entry, he asked coots if he was going down (outby) the no. 7 entry.  coots said he was.  at this point, coots lost sight of eldridge and pulled his coal hauler outby in the no. 7 entry.  coots, then stopped, changed directions, and began traveling inby in the no. 7 entry with loading end first to the no. 2, right side continuous mining machine.  coots traveled inby approximately 10 feet when he heard an unusual sound.  he immediately stopped the coal hauler using the service brakes.  realizing that eldridge had been struck by the coal hauler, coots began yelling for help.  terry steeley, no. 28 coal hauler operator, and dukes traveled on foot to the accident scene and saw eldridge’s leg from beneath the no. 26 coal hauler.steeley and coots ran to the mine phone located near the power center and steeley called outside for help. carlos ewing, no. 2 continuous mining machine operator; mike jones, no. 1 scoop operator; shawn howard, no. 8 roof bolting machine operator; and brian looney arrived at the accident scene.  dukes asked looney to go get the section foreman and brandon lamond, production coordinator, who was already on the section as part of his normal routine.  at approximately 10:58 a.m., howard checked eldridge for a pulse and reported to the group that he could not detect a pulse.lamond and caudill arrived at the accident scene at approximately 11:05 a.m.  from observation and report of no pulse, they realized eldridge was deceased.   lamond asked caudill and the rest of no. 6 unit miners to leave the area.  lamond went to the mine phone to notify mine management of the accident and to have them call for ems personnel and notify msha.  at approximately 11:40 a.m. lamond sent coots outside with another miner to aid him.  at approximately 11:45 a.m., lamond, darrin browning, maintenance foreman, and young pulled eldridge from beneath the coal hauler and placed him on a stretcher.  eldridge was then transported out of the mine.  at 12:23 p.m. eldridge arrived on the surface and was loaded into the awaiting ambulance.the union county coroner determined that the victim died instantly when the accident occurred at 10:55 a.m. "

Foster, Jr., District Manager\n', 'OVERVIEW': 'On December 1, 2014, Darwin O. Glover, Contract Truck Driver, age 46, was killed while operating an articulated haul truck.\xa0 Glover was traveling along the main quarry haul road and failed to negotiate a curve in the road.\xa0 The truck traveled over a berm and went into a large pond. \xa0Glover drowned in the accident and a rescue diver extricated him from the truck.The accident occurred due to contractor management’s failure to ensure that the victim maintained control of the truck he was operating at all times.\xa0 An inspection of the truck did not identify any defects and the haul road and berms were in good condition. \xa0Glover was not wearing a seat belt.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'Millersville Quarry, a surface crushed limestone operation owned and operated by MGQ Aggregates Incorporated, is located in Helena, Sandusky County, Ohio.\xa0 The principal operating official is Lynn Radabaugh, President.\xa0 The mine operates one 8-hour shift per day, five days per week.\xa0 Total employment is eight persons.A surface lime facility, owned and operated by Carmeuse Lime Inc., is located on the same property.\xa0 The two operations are physically separated by Ohio State Route 635; however, they are connected by a 1.5-mile long main quarry haul road (see Figure 1).\xa0 Ponds are located to the north and south of this haul road with water depths ranging up to 45 feet deep.At the Millersville Quarry, limestone is drilled and blasted from a multiple-bench quarry.\xa0 An excavator is used to feed the broken limestone into portable plants for crushing and sizing.\xa0 A front-end loader is used to load the material into haul trucks for transport to Carmeuse Lime Inc.’s plant for further processing.\xa0 The limestone is heated in kilns and further reduced to produce hydrated lime.\xa0 The final product is sold for use in the agricultural and cement industries.\xa0Mark’s Excavating & Trucking, owned and operated by Mark Schaffer, President, is located in Norwalk, Huron County, Ohio.\xa0 The company is contracted by MGQ Aggregates Incorporated to perform stripping operations prior to mining in the quarry.\xa0 Eleven persons work at the mine on one 8-hour shift, five days per week.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this mine on April 23, 2014.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On December 1, 2014, Darwin O. Glover (victim) reported for work at 6:30 a.m., his normal starting time.\xa0 Timothy Knoll, Supervisor, instructed Glover to operate an articulated haul truck to transport overburden from the quarry to a reclamation area at Carmeuse Lime Inc.’s facility.\xa0 Glover began hauling and dumping successive loads of material as instructed.\xa0 At about 10:30\xa0a.m., Glover dumped a load of overburden at the dump site and was returning to the stripping operation. \xa0After making a 90-degree turn, Glover crossed State Route 635 to access the main quarry haul road.\xa0 He drove eastward approximately 454 feet down a grade of 5\xa0percent and onto a level area where the road turned approximately 36 degrees to the south. \xa0In this area, ponds were located on each side of the haul road.\xa0 Jeremy Briggs, Quarry Superintendent, was traveling in the opposite direction.\xa0 Briggs noticed Glover’s truck was traveling faster than normal speed and crossing over into his lane.\xa0 Briggs realized that Glover was not going to negotiate the curve.Glover’s truck did not follow the turn but traveled straight approximately 213 feet and impacted the northern berm at a 21-degree angle.\xa0 The truck then straddled the berm and skidded for approximately 64 feet before the right side wheels rode up and over the berm and the truck entered the pond.Briggs drove his haul truck to the pond and saw the submerged cab of Glover’s truck.\xa0 Briggs immediately radioed for help and then called 9‑1-1 for emergency assistance.\xa0 At 10:55 a.m., local fire and water rescue services arrived at the site.\xa0 A rescue diver entered the pond and extricated Glover from the fully submerged truck.\xa0 Emergency medical services arrived and transported Glover to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.\xa0 The cause of death was attributed to drowning.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'MSHA was notified of the accident at 11:42 a.m. on December 1, 2014, by a telephone call from Jeremy Briggs, Quarry Superintendent, to the National Call Center.\xa0 The National Call Center notified Joseph M. Denk, Staff Assistant, and an investigation was started the same day.\xa0 An order was issued under provisions of Section 103(j) of the Mine Act.\xa0 This order was later modified to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act after the arrival of an Authorized Representative at the mine site.\xa0 Part 50 citations were issued to Mark’s Excavating & Trucking and MGQ Aggregates Incorporated, for untimely reporting.MSHA’s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident.\xa0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine and contractor management and employees and local law enforcement.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred on the main quarry haul road approximately 960 feet from State Route 635 near a 36-degree curve to the south in the haul road.\xa0 The victim’s truck was traveling from west to east.\xa0 Substantial berms are constructed on both sides along the length of the haul road.\xa0 The haul road is smooth, consisting of hard-packed limestone, and is approximately 40\xa0feet wide between the berms.\xa0 The posted speed limit at the mine and on the main quarry haul road is 25\xa0mph.The berms consist primarily of limestone rocks ranging in size from 3 inches to 8\xa0inches.\xa0 The berm height in the area where the truck ran over the berm is approximately 66 inches above the adjacent roadway with a base approximately 17 feet between the roadway and pond.\xa0 Tire tracks on the berm indicate the left front tire impacted the berm at an angle of approximately 21\xa0degrees.\xa0 As the result of trucks traveling the road and periodic grading, fine limestone dust had accumulated over time between the base of the berms and the haul road.\xa0 This created an approximately 30‑inch wide and 16-inch high ramp up onto the berms.Equipment InvolvedGeneral Information:\xa0The truck involved in the accident is a 2004 Caterpillar Model 725 Articulated Haul Truck consisting of a tractor unit and a trailer unit.\xa0 The truck is approximately 32-feet long, 9-feet wide, and 11-feet high and is powered by a 6-cylinder, turbocharged diesel engine.\xa0 The transmission has six forward speeds and one reverse speed.\xa0 The operator selects the gear using a shift lever in the operator’s compartment.\xa0 The transmission has an integral hydraulic retarder activated by a lever on the right side of the steering column.\xa0 The truck has six-wheel drive, with one axle on the tractor unit and two axles on the trailer.\xa0 The truck’s rated load capacity is 26 tons and its approximate gross vehicle weight is 51 tons.\xa0 Caterpillar specifications for the truck indicate a top speed of 32.1\xa0mph in sixth gear.\nTruck Conditions Found:\xa0The truck sustained minor damage due to the accident.\xa0 Water entered the engine, transmission, and hydraulic systems.\xa0 The front windshield was broken and the fiberglass cowling behind the operator’s compartment was cracked and had pieces broken off.\xa0 The front skid plate was bent up and the adjacent engine exhaust pipe was bent in and had approximately a ⅜-inch hole in the pipe in this area.\n\tThe positions of the operator’s controls were observed and the engine start switch (key) was in the “on” (run) position. The transmission selector lever was in the “1” position.\xa0 The retarder lever was in the disengaged (off) position.\xa0 The parking brake was in the pushed-in, disengaged (off) position.\xa0 The control positions may have been affected during the accident or recovery from the pond.\xa0\n\tThe machine was equipped with 23.5R25 radial tires.\xa0 The rolling radius of the tires, with the truck unloaded, was approximately 28.75 inches and the tread width was approximately 22\xa0inches.\xa0 The tires were found to be in good to fair condition.\xa0\n\tNo significant debris or extraneous items were found in the operator’s compartment that would have interfered with the truck’s operation.\xa0 The steering wheel, accelerator, and brake pedal were operated by hand without difficulty.\nEvent (Fault) Codes at the Time of Accident:\xa0 Although the batteries were dead, the truck’s Electronic Control Modules (ECMs) and electrical circuits operated properly after the truck was re-powered.\xa0 Data from the truck’s ECMs were downloaded and the ECM time was recorded in hour increments.\xa0 The only code possibly related to the accident was for a “Low Steering Pump Pressure” event at transmission hour reading 6032 hours which corresponded to the engine hour reading of 6070 hours.\xa0 Since numerous other event codes occurred at the same time, this is considered to be the time of the vehicle entered the water.\xa0 The investigators concluded that the low steering pressure event occurred as a result of the truck entering the water.\nPre-operational Examinations and Maintenance:\xa0 Examination and Maintenance records, dating from August\xa013, 2005, were available and reviewed.\xa0 In 2014, no pre-operational examination records indicated any problems with the truck.\xa0 The only steering and braking system defects previously noted were for the parking brake system (in 2013) and steering system (in 2008, 2012, and 2013) low pressure switches.\xa0 The investigators concluded that these defects did not represent a recurring problem and were not contributing factors in the accident.\n\tThe hydraulic filters for the hydraulic (braking and steering) system were removed and inspected.\xa0 No significant accumulation of debris was observed on the filters.\xa0 Maintenance records indicated that the filters had been changed approximately four months prior to the accident.\nRepairs Made to Allow Testing:\xa0 After the truck was recovered from the water, it was hauled to the contractor’s main shop in Norwalk, Ohio.\xa0 The truck’s engine, transmission, and hydraulic systems were drained to remove water and fluids.\xa0 After new filters were installed and necessary fluids replaced, the engine was restarted to conduct operational testing.\nOperator Controls and Testing:\xa0 The gear shift lever, park brake control, hoist control, and the retarder lever sent correct signals to the ECM when moved through their various positions.\xa0 The accelerator pedal appeared to properly control the engine speed after the engine was started.\xa0 The ECM monitor for the accelerator pedal indicated that pedal’s signal to the ECM moved from 0 percent to approximately 95 percent and back to 0 percent as the pedal was fully applied and then released.\xa0 The accelerator pedal worked as designed.\nBraking Systems Design and Testing:\xa0 The truck is equipped with a dual system, hydraulic service brake and a spring-applied, hydraulic pressure-released parking brake.\xa0 The parking brake functions as a tertiary brake if both service braking systems fail.\xa0 The service braking system activates dry caliper disc brakes on the tractor axle and on the first rear axle.\xa0 Two calipers are provided on the discs at each wheel.\xa0 The second rear axle is not designed with service brakes.\xa0 The park brake system activates a dry caliper disc brake attached to the output drive shaft of the transmission. \xa0The park brake acts on both of the trailer axles.\xa0\n\tThe service and parking brake systems are supplied with hydraulic pressure from an engine driven piston pump.\xa0 The hydraulic pressure applies service brakes when the operator activates a foot pedal in the operator’s compartment. \xa0Hydraulic pressure releases the parking brake when a control button in the operator’s compartment is depressed.\xa0 The parking brake is applied by pulling the button out.\xa0 Both systems are provided with a hydraulic accumulator which reduces lag time in application of the service brake and release of the park brake.\n\tVisual inspection of the brake pads and rotors did not reveal any significant defects.\xa0 After the truck was repaired (as described above) to allow operational brake testing, hydraulic fluid was observed leaking at the front right brake line block that tees in the upper and lower calipers.\xa0 A line support clamp, approximately 18 inches from the block, was loose and allowed the line to vibrate at the block.\xa0 The investigators concluded that the slight leak did not affect the capability of the service braking system.\n\tThe service brake holding ability was checked with the service brake applied, the transmission in first gear, and the engine speed increased to 1200 rpm and the truck did not move.\xa0 The service brake met Caterpillar’s brake holding ability specifications.\n\tAccording to Caterpillar specifications, the parking brake is to be tested on a 15 percent grade.\xa0 Since the truck was taken to the contractor’s shop, it could not be tested on a grade.\xa0 However, when the truck was pulled from the pond, it was found with the parking brake disengaged.\xa0 The parking brake was subsequently set to prohibit inadvertent movement while the truck was being examined.\xa0 The investigators noted that when the truck was pulled away from the berm and loaded onto a ‘low boy’ trailer, all four rear tires skidded.\xa0 This indicated that for an unloaded truck, as was the case prior the accident, the parking brake had the capability of stopping the truck, if necessary, in the event of an emergency.\nSteering System Design and Testing:\xa0\xa0The articulated truck frame steering is provided by double-acting hydraulic steering cylinders that provide 45-degree left and right steering.\xa0 Caterpillar specifies a turning radius of 23 feet 10 inches.\xa0 Under normal operation, the steering system is provided hydraulic pressure by a piston pump connected to the engine.\xa0 In the case of loss of primary steering pressure, secondary steering is provided by a battery-driven hydraulic pump.\xa0 A secondary test switch is located on the instrument panel in the operator’s compartment.\xa0 Using this switch, the secondary steering system was tested at the accident site after installing new batteries in the truck.\xa0 The secondary steering system worked and no leaks were observed in the steering circuit.\xa0\n\tAccording to Caterpillar specifications, a steering time test was performed with the engine at high idle while measuring the average time from steering stop to stop when rotating the steering wheel at 60 rpm.\xa0 The average of 10 tests of the stop to stop times was approximately 4.8 seconds which met the Caterpillar specifications.\xa0 No damage, leakage, or operational problems were noted with the steering system.\nSeat Belt:\xa0\xa0The seat belt latched and unlatched when tested.\nWeatherOn the day of the accident, skies were clear with an average temperature of 34\xa0degrees Fahrenheit with calm winds.\xa0 Sunrise was at 7:44 a.m. \xa0The investigators determined that weather conditions and lighting were not contributing factors in the accident.SummarySubstantial berms had been constructed on both sides along the length of the entire of the main quarry haul road.\xa0 The haul road was smooth and approximately 40 feet wide between the berms.\xa0 The posted speed limit at the mine and on the main quarry haul road was 25 mph.\xa0 There were no road obstructions or adverse weather conditions.\xa0 In addition, there were no defects identified with the haul truck’s braking systems, steering system, or accelerator.\xa0 Other than excessive speed, there were no conditions present that would have restricted the ability of the driver to control the truck at the time of the accident.', 'TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE': 'Darwin O. Glover had 20 years of experience as a mobile equipment operator.\xa0 Glover worked for the contractor, primarily as a truck driver, for the past 1½ years, but had worked at the mine for only five days.\xa0\nA representative of MSHA’s Educational Field and Small Mine Services conducted an in-depth review of the contractor’s part 46 training records for Glover. \xa0The records documented that he had received all required training, including task training on the articulated haul truck that he was operating.\xa0 He received site-specific hazard training through MGQ Aggregates Incorporated and Carmeuse Lime Inc.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'The investigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified the following root causes:Root Cause: \xa0Contractor management did not ensure that the victim maintained control of the truck he was operating at all times.Corrective Action: \xa0Contractor management established procedures to ensure that mobile equipment operators maintain control of trucks at all times while operating them.\xa0 The procedures require that mobile equipment operators obey posted speed limits and maintain safe control of the equipment being operated.\xa0 All contract truck drivers were trained in these new policies and procedures.Root Cause:\xa0Contractor management policies, procedures, and controls did not ensure the victim wore his seat belt when operating the haul truck.Corrective Action:\xa0All contract truck drivers received additional training regarding the required use of seat belts when operating haul trucks. \xa0Management will monitor truck drivers to ensure seat belts are worn.', 'CONCLUSION': 'The accident occurred due to contractor management’s failure to ensure that the victim maintained control of the truck he was operating at all times.\xa0 An inspection of the truck did not identify any defects and the haul road and berms were in good condition.\xa0 Glover was not wearing a seat belt.', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'Issued to

Crane backed the haul truck to the edge of an overburden dumpsite and started to raise the truck’s bed to dump a load of material. The bank failed, causing the truck to overturn and fall 30 feet below.The accident occurred due to management’s failure to ensure examinations were conducted periodically at the dumping location throughout the shift as changing conditions warranted. Management also failed to ensure that loads were dumped a safe distance back from the undercut edge of the overburden stockpile.An excavator removed material from the toe area of the overburden stockpile as material was being dumped from the haul truck at the top. Removing material from the pile steepened the slope angle from 30 to 39 degrees, creating an unstable condition at the dump site. The loaded haul truck backed very close to the edge of the overburden stockpile where the weight from the truck caused a localized failure and loss of ground under the back wheels of the loaded truck. As the rear of the truck dropped, the downward and lateral momentum caused it to flip over onto the cab, landing approximately 30 feet down the slope of the overburden stockpile.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'South Sterling Quarry, a surface crushed sandstone operation owned and operated by Edwards Sand & Stone, is located in Greene Township, Pike County, Pennsylvania. The principal operating official is George F. Edwards Jr., President. The mine typically operates one 9 hour shift, five days per week.

A front-end loader is used to load haul trucks which transport the broken sandstone to a primary plant for processing. There the material is crushed, sized, washed and sold as construction aggregates.Stripping overburden is included as part of the mining cycle at the quarry. An excavator is used to remove overburden from an elevated bench and load it into a haul truck which transports the material to an established dump site on top of an overburden stockpile. A second excavator is used on a bench located on the downstream slope of the overburden stockpile about ten feet above the toe. It removes material from the slope directly below the dump site and feeds it into a remotely-controlled mobile screening plant located near the toe. The portable plant is used to separate the material into three sizes which are placed in respective stockpiles using a front-end loader.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on October 17, 2014.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On November 25, 2014, James P. Crane (victim) reported for work at 7:00 a.m., his normal starting time. Michael R. Nebraski, Plant Manager, instructed Crane to operate a haul truck to transport material from the overburden bench to the overburden dump site. Afterward, Crane began hauling successive loads of material as instructed. At approximately 1:15 p.m., Crane hauled a load of material from the overburden bench to the top of the overburden stockpile and backed the haul truck into the dump site. At that time, Egon E. Hussman, Excavator Operator, was feeding material into the portable screening plant located at the base of the overburden stockpile. Hussman noticed Crane’s haul truck was not approaching the dump point squarely. He sounded the excavator’s horn and raised its bucket, attempting to stop Crane; however, Crane’s truck continued to back up. The bank collapsed and Hussman turned the excavator and trammed it away from the falling haul truck.Ronald C. Heffner, Front-end Loader Operator, was stockpiling sorted material from the portable screening plant when he saw Crane’s haul truck falling over the dump site. Heffner immediately radioed for assistance and parked his machine. When Hussman swung his excavator around, he saw Heffner running toward the overturned haul truck. When Heffner arrived at the truck, he found Crane attempting to crawl out of the window of the cab and helped him get out of the cab.When Mark L. Courtright, Front-end Loader Operator, heard Heffner’s call for help, he radioed the mine office and asked George F. Edwards III, Asphalt Plant Manager, to call 9-1-1 for emergency assistance. Courtright drove to the overburden stockpile where he and Heffner assisted Crane until emergency medical services arrived at 1:23 p.m. At 2:24 p.m., Crane was transported by a life flight helicopter to a hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Crane died en route to the medical facility. The cause of death was attributed to multiple blunt force trauma injuries.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'MSHA was notified of the accident at 2:34 p.m. on November 25, 2014, by a telephone call from George F. Edwards Jr., President, to the National Call Center. The National Call Center notified Kevin T. Hardester, Staff Assistant, and an investigation was started the same day. An order was issued under provisions of Section 103(j) of the Mine Act. This order was later modified to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act after the arrival of an Authorized Representative at the mine site.MSHA’s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident. MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, employees, and local and State law enforcement.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred at an overburden dump site. Stripping overburden is included as part of the mining cycle at the quarry (see Figure 1). An excavator is used to remove overburden from an elevated bench and load it into a haul truck on a bench below (see Figure 2). The loading area is approximately 800 feet from the established dumping location. The first 525 feet is predominantly level and the remaining 275 feet is sloped downward between 16.5 and 21.5 percent toward a dumping area (see Figure 3).As a haul truck approaches the dump site, it must turn at least 90 degrees to the right, reverse direction, back to the edge, and dump (see Figures 4 and 5). The haul truck has to back to the dump point on a radius of approximately 25 feet (as measured from tire rutting shown in Figure 5) and then begin to dump material. The immediate approach to the dump site is sloped downward approximately 1.5 percent toward the edge.A second excavator is used on a bench located on the downstream slope of the overburden stockpile about ten feet above the toe. It removes material from the slope and feeds it into a remotely-controlled mobile screening plant located near the toe (see Figure 6). The plant is used to separate the material into three sizes (cobbles, gravel, and fine soil). After separation, the materials are placed in stockpiles using a front-end loader (see Figure 7).The overburden material consists primarily of cohesive soil material. Cobbles and gravel comprise relatively smaller fractions of the material. Though loose and cohesive, the materials on the slopes of the stockpile naturally repose to an angle of approximately 30 degrees. Where it had been loaded out the toe area, the slope had steepened to about 39 degrees extending to the immediate dump site (see Figures 8 and 9).The material directly beneath the back tires of the haul truck at the dump point failed, sliding away approximately 6 to 8 feet back from the edge, 18 feet across the dump, and 10 feet down the steepened slope (see Figure 10). The weight of the loaded haul truck triggered this localized failure beneath the haul truck’s back wheels, causing the haul truck to overturn and land on its roof approximately 30 feet down the slope at a slight angle, with the operator side slightly further downslope.The remaining berms on each side of the dump site were approximately 18 inches high. The material comprising the berms (which was the same as the loose overburden material being dumped) was soft, loose, and cohesive. On the day before the accident, the area had received approximately 1.4 inches of rain. Deep tire rutting at the surface of the dump area indicated the overburden material was still wet. Tire imprints remaining on the surface of the dump area clearly indicated the material used to construct the berms had little strength and could be easily penetrated by the tires of the moving truck. A noncontributory citation was issued. Cracking of the ground surface in the dump area was also evident (see Figure 11).EquipmentGeneral Information:\xa0The haul truck involved in the accident was a 1994 Euclid Model R35 324TDC, rigid frame, off-highway truck. The truck was powered by a 6-cylinder, Cummins 18.8 liter, turbocharged diesel engine. The truck was 26-feet 11-inches long, 12-feet 1 inch wide and 13-feet 5-inches high. The rated maximum gross machine weight was 146,000 pounds, the empty weight was 65,100 pounds, and the payload capacity was 80,900 pounds.\nTruck Conditions Found:\xa0Immediately after the truck was up righted, the control positions were noted. The transmission selector lever was in D (Drive). The emergency and load/dump brake toggle switch was found in the “brake applied” position. The park brake, which was designed to automatically apply when the air pressure dropped below 40 psi, was found in the “brake applied” position. The service brake pedal, retarder pedal, and throttle pedal operated freely.\nRepairs Made to Allow Testing:\xa0The truck had an electronically controlled, automatic transmission with six forward speeds, neutral, and two reverse speeds. The shift control lever provided automatic shifting up to the gear position selected by the operator, but no higher. In the “D” position, the transmission started in first gear and automatically upshifted as the speed increased. When tested, the transmission gear selector operated to shift the truck into forward and reverse gears as described in the operator’s manual.\nSteering System Design and Testing:\xa0Two double-acting cylinders acted to steer the front wheels. Supplementary steering was provided by an automatic, electric-battery driven pump circuit that supplied hydraulic pressure to steer the front wheels if engine power was lost. A supplementary steering on-off switch was provided inside the operator’s cab. The operator’s manual instructed the operator to turn this switch to the “on” position immediately after starting engine and to turn it to the “off” position just prior to shutting the engine down when parking the truck. The truck was maneuvered through a number of left and right turns and no steering deficiencies were found. The supplemental steering system functioned when tested and operated as described in the operator’s manual.\nThrottle Pedal Testing:\xa0The throttle pedal operated freely and returned to the low idle position when released.\nBraking System Overview:\xa0The truck was equipped with a service brake, an emergency and load/dump brake, a parking brake, and a retarder.\nService Brake System Design and Testing:\xa0A foot-operated valve controlled a dual circuit, air-over-oil service brake system. It had one circuit for the front dry disc brakes and another circuit for the rear axle wet disc brakes. The service brake pedal moved freely throughout its range of motion and returned to the brake released position when foot pressure was released. When tested, the service braking performance was above the minimum acceptable performance level and was in the preferred performance range as specified by Euclid for an R35 truck with dry caliper-disc front brakes and wet disc rear brakes. The brake linings on the dry disc front brakes exceeded the minimum lining thickness specified by Euclid. Both of the front axle brake discs exceeded the minimum Euclid disc thickness specification. No braking system leaks were found. The brake discs were dry and clean with no oil contamination. No service brake deficiencies were found when the truck was operated and numerous stops were made. An additional test showed the service brake had the ability to stop and hold the empty truck on a 15% test slope.\nEmergency and Load/Dump Brake Design and Testing:\xa0The truck was equipped with an on-off toggle switch for the emergency and load/dump brake. This switch was designed to apply the rear brakes at full pressure. The Euclid operator’s manual stated that this switch should be used to hold the attended machine stationary for loading, dumping, and waiting. The emergency and load/dump brake control functioned to apply and release the emergency and load/dump brake. When tested, the emergency and load/dump brake had the ability to hold the empty truck on a 15% test slope.\nParking Brake Design and Testing:\xa0The parking brake was a spring actuated, air released, driveline drum brake mounted on the rear of the transmission. A push-pull hand control for the parking brake was located on the dashboard. The parking brake was also designed to automatically actuate if the air pressure dropped to 40 +/- 5 psi. The parking brake control functioned to apply and release the parking brake. When tested, the parking brake had the capability of holding the empty truck on a 15% test slope.\nRetarder System Design and Testing:\xa0A foot operated valve controlled the air/oil actuation of the same wet disc brakes used by the service braking system. The operator could vary the retarding force by varying how far the retarder pedal was depressed. The retarder pedal functioned to apply and release the retarder. When tested, the retarder had the capability of holding the empty truck on a 15% test slope.\nCompressor Governor and Low Air Warning Tests:\xa0The compressor cut-in and cut-out pressures, when tested, were 105 psi and 130 psi which was in the correct operating range as specified by Euclid. The truck was equipped with a wig-wag low air pressure warning device at the top of the windshield. When tested, the wig-wag arm dropped into the operator’s field of view when system pressure was reduced to 95 psi, which was in the correct operating range as specified by Euclid.\nSeat Belt:\xa0The seat belt latched and unlatched when tested. The investigators could not determine if Crane was wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident because he climbed out of the cab after the accident.\nSummaryNo problems were found with the haul truck’s transmission, steering system, throttle pedal, braking systems, or the retarder that would have restricted the ability of the driver to control the truck at the time of the accident.WeatherOn the day of the accident, weather conditions were clear with an average temperature of 46 degrees Fahrenheit. Sunrise was 6:59 a.m. Average wind speed was 14 mph with gusts up to 39 mph. On November 24, 2014, the day before the accident, the recorded total rainfall for the area was 1.42 inches. The investigators determined that the resultant wet conditions present at the overburden dump site, due to previous rainfall in the area, was a contributing factor in the accident.ExaminationsManagement failed to inspect the dump area periodically throughout the shift as changing conditions warranted. Persons responsible for visually inspecting the dump area prior to work commencing did not recognize clear evidence the ground would not support the mobile equipment. This evidence included loose, wet, cohesive material that had been significantly steepened by excavating material from the toe of the overburden dump area. Cracks were also found on the surface at the top of the dumping location. The person examining the dumping location should have recognized the instability of the dump area and should have required that loads of overburden material be dumped a safe distance back from the edge.', 'TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE': 'James P. Crane had 10½ years of mining experience as a truck driver, all at this mine. A representative of MSHA’s Educational Field Services reviewed the mine operator’s Part 46 training records for Crane. He had received all required training.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'The investigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified the following root causes:Root Cause:\xa0Management failed to inspect the dumping location periodically throughout the shift as changing conditions warranted. Material had been loaded from the stockpile directly below the dump location which steepened the slope angle and reduced the stability.Corrective Action:\xa0Management established policies and procedures to ensure that dumping locations are inspected at the beginning of the shift and during mining operations for signs of slope instability. The top of the dump area is to be examined for cracks, unstable ground, and sunken or soft areas. The load-out area is to be examined for signs of undercutting and over steepening of the slope. All mobile equipment operators were trained in these new policies and procedures.Root Cause:\xa0Management failed to ensure that loads were dumped a safe distance back from the undercut edge of the overburden stockpile.Corrective Action:\xa0Management established policies and procedures to ensure that loads are dumped a safe distance back from the edge of the overburden stockpile. A front-end loader will be used to push the material over the edge. No material will be dumped over the edge while material is being removed from the toe of the stockpile. All mobile equipment operators were trained in these new policies and procedures.', 'CONCLUSION': 'The accident occurred due to management’s failure to ensure examinations were conducted periodically at the dumping location throughout the shift as changing conditions warranted. Management also failed to ensure that loads were dumped a safe distance back from the undercut edge of the overburden stockpile.', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'Issued to Edwards Sand & Stone\nOrder No. 8803858\xa0- Issued on November 25, 2014, under the provisions of Section 103(j) of the Mine Act.\xa0 An Authorized Representative modified this order to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act upon arrival at the mine site:An accident occurred at this mine on November 25, 2014, at approximately 14:30 hours.\xa0 As rescue and recovery work is necessary, this order is being issued, under Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety Act of 1977, to assure the safety of all persons at this operation.\xa0 This order is also being issued to prevent the destruction of any evidence which would assist in investigating the cause or causes of the accident.\xa0 It prohibits all activity at the entire mine area and mine site until MSHA has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in this area.\xa0 This order applies to all persons engaged in the rescue and recovery operation and any other persons on-site.\xa0 This order was initially issued to the mine operator at 14:43 and has now been reduced to writing.\xa0\nThe initial order is modified to reflect that MSHA is now proceeding under the authority of Section 103(K) Order of the Federal Mine and Health Act of 1977.\xa0 This Order is intended to protect the safety of all persons on-site, including those involved in the rescue and recovery operations or investigation of the accident.\xa0 The mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an Authorized Representative of the Secretary for all actions to recover and / or restore operations in the affected area.\xa0 Additionally, the mine operator is reminded of its existing obligations to prevent the destruction of evidence that would aid in the investigating the cause or causes of the accident.\nThe order was terminated December 6, 2014, when conditions that contributed to the accident no longer existed.Citation No. 8807912\xa0-\xa0Issued under the provisions of 104(a) of the Mine Act for a violation of 30 CFR §\xa056.9304(a):A fatal accident occurred at this operation on\xa0November 25, 2014, when a truck driver was fatally injured while dumping a load of material at the overburden dump site.\xa0 At the time of the accident,\xa0material was being excavated from the toe of the overburden stockpile directly beneath the dump site.\xa0 Removing material from the pile in this manner had steepened the slope angle from 30 to 39 degrees, creating an unstable condition at the dump site.\xa0 Consequently, the\xa0edge of the over-steepened stockpile collapsed under the weight of the truck causing the truck to overturn.\xa0 The mine operator failed to inspect the dumping location\xa0over the course of the shift as changing ground conditions warranted.\nCitation No. 8807913\xa0-\xa0Issued under the provisions of 104(d)(1) of the Mine Act for a violation of 30 CFR §\xa056.9304(b):A fatal accident occurred at this operation on\xa0November 25, 2014,\xa0when a truck driver was fatally injured while dumping a load of material at the overburden dump site.

The team then travelled underground to the accident site where observations, measurements and photographs of the scene were made. During the day shift on November 11, 2014, Kelley Surveying PLLC prepared a sketch and mapped the accident site (See Appendix B).\xa0 On November 12, 2014, the accident investigation team made a follow up visit to the site. \xa0The No. 2 roof bolting machine was inspected and additional measurements and photographs were obtained.\xa0 No deficiencies were found with the roof bolting machine. \xa0Formal interviews were conducted on Monday, November 17, 2014, at the MEPCO, LLC corporate office located near Star City, West Virginia. \xa0A representative of the victim’s family was present during the interviews.\xa0 A list of persons who participated in the investigation is contained in Appendix C.\xa0 Appendix D contains a list of persons interviewed.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Accident LocationThe accident occurred at block 239 in the No. 2 entry of the 2-North section.\xa0 This was an extended cut measuring approximately 33 feet that had been previously mined this shift.Roof Bolting MachineThe equipment involved in the accident was a Roof Ranger II twin head roof bolting machine, model RRB – B-A, serial number 2008-026, company No. 2 manufactured by J.H. Fletcher and Co.\xa0 The machine is provided with drill station canopies equipped with slider extensions.\xa0 The ATRS system is an “L” style - “T bar” with one ATRS pad on each end of the unit measuring 16 inches long by 12 inches wide.\xa0 The width of the ATRS system is manually adjustable with four pin selections on each side, each 6 inches apart.\xa0 The pins were located in the second slot from the inside.\xa0 At this setting in an 18-foot wide entry, the left pad was measured to be 58 inches from the rib.\xa0 This is within the allowable maximum distance of 60 inches.Twin Boom Roof Bolting Machine ControlsThere are two sets of controls on the roof bolting machine that control different functions.\xa0 The “inch tram” controls are located near the center of the machine and control movement of the roof-bolting machine.\xa0 The controls for the ATRS are also located at this location.\xa0 The roof drilling controls are the second set of controls. \xa0An attached canopy is located over the roof drilling controls and provides protection for the roof bolting machine operator.\xa0 The canopy and roof drilling controls move/swing as one unit.\xa0 The distance between the last installed bolt and the canopy increases or decreases depending on the location of the roof drilling controls.\xa0 This machine is not provided with controls at the “inch tram” control station to move/swing the roof drilling controls.\xa0 These controls are located with the roof drilling controls.Normal Roof Bolt Installation ProcedureWhen the roof bolting machine is advanced to install the new row of bolts, the ATRS system is set against the roof, providing temporary support.\xa0 The current approved roof control plan allows the ATRS system to be 6 feet from the last row of permeant support and 5 feet from the closest rib.\xa0 When the roof bolting machine was positioned to reconstruct the accident, the distance between the ATRS pad and the last row of bolts measured 60.5 inches and the distance between the ATRS pad and the left rib measured 58 inches. \xa0The placement of the temporary support provided by the ATRS system was in compliance with the current approved roof control plan.\xa0 The roof drilling controls are located on the outside of the machine close to the ATRS. \xa0This location places the roof bolting machine operator between the coal rib and drill station to operate the controls. \xa0The normal roof bolting sequence is to first install the outside bolt in the row.\xa0 \xa0The inside bolt is installed last (Refer again to Appendix A for roof bolt installation sequence).\xa0 This installation sequence leaves the roof drilling controls and canopy adjacent to the machine when the row is completed.\xa0 The roof drilling controls are normally left in the inside bolting position to advance the roof-bolting machine for installing the next row of roof bolts.\xa0 The canopy over the drilling station was not in optimal position to deflect the rock that fell in the area between \xa0the coal rib, the last row of installed support and the ATRS pad.\xa0 Savage was located in this area between the roof drilling controls and the “inch tram” controls, when the accident occurred.\xa0GeologyThe rock fell from a contact location where two different types of rock intersected. \xa0The rock separated from beneath a compaction slickenside, which represented a plane of low cohesion while disrupting the lateral continuity of the strata.\xa0 The compaction zone represents a narrow sand channel that meanders northeast/southwest across the section, but lobes of the sand channel were only exposed in the mining horizon in the No. 2 entry/Crosscut No. 239 intersection.\xa0 The small pods of sandstone are very hard and dense; producing sparks when struck with a hammer, and define a keel shape that protrudes from the roof.\xa0 Shale of the immediate roof was compacted around the obdurate sandstone, forming meandering slickensides that follow the trend of the keel-shaped sandstone.\xa0 The compaction slickensides represent low-angle folds, dipping from 8-11 degrees away from a central axis that follows the trend of the sandstone.\xa0 The fatal rock represents a slickenside-bounded block of shale that destabilized.Examination of the SectionPossible adverse roof conditions were identifiable across the section.\xa0 These areas were bolted by experienced roof bolters and examined (preshifted) by a certified foreman.\xa0 The adverse roof was present in the outby cross cut between the No. 2 to No. 1 entries and extended into the No. 2 entry where the accident occurred.\xa0 However, the adverse roof in the cross cut was not as pronounced being broad and shallow, allowing the condition to go undetected.\xa0 \xa0Roof Control PlanThe last fully revised and consolidated roof control plan was approved on September 5, 2014. \xa0The plan permitted a maximum mining width of 18 feet and required the roof to be supported with fully-grouted roof bolts at least 48 inches long in normal mining conditions. \xa0Roof bolts are spaced no more than 4 feet apart, side to side, and a maximum distance of 4 ½ feet apart between rows.\xa0 When mining over or within 100 feet of a “Pittsburgh break” zone, two cables bolts are required to be installed between every row of support. \xa0If torque tension bolts are used as primary support, two cable bolts are required to be installed between every other row of bolts.\xa0 A “Pittsburgh break” zone refers to areas of old workings, partial mining, or barrier pillars left in the Pittsburg coal seam which lies 80 feet beneath the Sewickley seam. \xa0The 2-left section had just crossed a “Pittsburgh break” zone in the No. 6, 7, and 8 entries at cross cut 239.\xa0 The roof supports being used at the time of the accident in all entries were 6-foot torque tension roof bolts in conjunction with two - twelve foot cable bolts installed between every other the row of supportThe extended cut section of the roof control plan also required the depths of the cut to be reduced to a length sufficient to effectively control the mine roof when adverse roof conditions are encountered. \xa0Adverse conditions are classified as clay veins, slips, mud seams, excessive water coming from the roof washouts or other irregularities. \xa0Where these conditions are encountered, longer bolts with boards, or larger plates, and if needed crossbars are to be installed.At the time of the accident all measurements and distances required by the roof control plan were complied with.The mine operator was following the provisions of the roof control plan pertaining to the “Pittsburgh break” zone across the entire section. \xa0Entries 6, 7, and 8, were still within the zone.Experience and TrainingThe victim had over 29 years mining experience, 24 years at this mine with 19 ½ years as a roof bolting machine operator. \xa0He received task training as a roof bolting machine operator on October 5, 2012, along with experienced miner training.\xa0 The victim’s annual refresher training was received on October 31, 2014, and was current at the time of the accident. \xa0', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'An analysis was conducted to identify the most basic cause of the accident that was correctable thought management controls.\xa0 Causal factors were identified that if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated the consequences.\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\nListed below are causal factors identified during the analysis and their corrective actions implemented to prevent a reoccurrence of the accident.1. Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator did not assure there was adequate protection provided between the ATRS, the rib, and the last row of supports. \xa0The ATRS had not been extended outward enough for the pads of the unit to come in contact with a rock that fell from the left rib line. The ATRS system on this machine is manually adjusted with four settings.\xa0 At the time of the accident, it was set in the second setting from the inside leaving a distance of 58 inches from the outside edge of the pad to the rib.\xa0 If the setting had been in one of the outside slots, the pad would likely have been in contact with the fallen rock and possibly prevented the accident.Corrective action:\xa0\xa0The approved roof control plan was revised to require that one of the two most outside slots be used during roof bolt installation. \xa0\xa0The miners were trained in the provisions of the revised roof control plan.2. Root Cause:\xa0\xa0The mine operator did not assure there was adequate protection provided between the ATRS, the rib, and the last row of supports. After the second roof bolt (middle) is installed in each cycle, the roof drilling controls and canopy remained adjacent to the machine while the machine was advanced to install the next row of roof bolts. \xa0This position, adjacent to the roof bolting machine, left an unsupported area between the ATRS and the last row of support. \xa0The canopy over the drilling station was not in optimal position to defect the rock that fell in the area bounded by the coal rib, the last row of installed support, and the ATRS pad.Corrective action:\xa0\nThe approved roof control plan was revised to require the drill station controls and the canopy to be moved to the outside position after the middle support is installed and before lowering the ATRS. \xa0The miners were trained in the provisions of the revised roof control plan.', 'CONCLUSION': 'The accident occurred because a roof anomaly (slickensided rock) was present, but was not identified prior to positioning the roof bolting machine and starting the roof bolting process.\xa0 The ATRS system was engaged with the roof at the time of the accident, but the pads of the ATRS were not in contact with the destabilized rock. \xa0The position of the roof drilling controls and canopy were adjacent to the machine, causing the victim to travel under the rock which fell without warning.\xa0 The mine operator did not assure that adequate protection was provided between the ATRS, the rib, and the last row of supports.', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'A 103(J) Order, Number 8060499, was issued to Red Bone Mining Company at approximately 10:30 p.m. to ensure the safety of all persons at the operation and to prevent the destruction of any evidence which would assist in investigating the cause or causes of the accident until an investigation was completed and the area deemed safe.\n\xa0\n'}","on monday november 10, 2014, savage; george ray, roof bolting machine operator; bill everly, roof bolting machine operator; and john shaffer, section mechanic, started the afternoon shift at 2:00 p.m.  savage and everly traveled into the mine together, while savage conducted an examination of the roadways.  ray and shaffer entered the mine together as ray conducted a preshift examination of the intake seals.  after arriving on the working section, shaffer serviced the continuous mining machine and ray and everly started roof bolting areas the previous shift left unsupported. 
  
the remainder of the crew arrived on the section and began normal mining activities at approximately 4:00 p.m.  during the shift, the mining cycle was determined as follows; mining in no. 2 to no. 1 crosscut, then to the no. 4 entry, then to the no. 2 entry.  the applicable page from the roof control plan can be found in appendix a.  at the time of the accident, mining was taking place in the no. 3 entry.  ray and everly were operating the no. 1 roof bolting machine (primary roof bolting machine).  the no. 1 roof bolting machine had mechanical problems, rendering the machine inoperable twice during the shift.  the first problem was a ground fault in the trailing cable while roof bolting in the no. 5 entry.  the second problem was a broken tram chain while bolting in the no. 4 entry.  shaffer repaired the machine on both occasions.   mining continued while shaffer made the repairs, increasing the number of unsupported cuts.   savage and jeff belanger, section utility man, used the no. 2 roof bolting machine (spare) to catch up on roof bolting while repairs were being made to the no. 1 roof bolting machine.  they bolted the no. 2 to no. 1 crosscut, no.4 entry, and no. 5 entry.  savage trammed the no. 2 roof bolting machine between the no. 2 and no. 3 crosscut and parked it while he conducted an examination of the section.after the examination, savage and belanger trammed the no. 2 roof bolting machine to the no. 2 entry to install roof bolts.  savage was operating the control side and belanger was operating the opposite side of the machine.  they installed the first row of roof bolts using four, 6-foot torque tension bolts and a 12-foot cable bolt from each drill head. using the inch-tram controls, savage advanced the machine to install the next row of bolts.  he set the atrs system in place and began placing roof bolts to be installed along the rib.  belanger had raised his drill steel against the roof when he heard a rock fall. belanger looked across the machine and could not see savage or his light.  belanger went around the rear of the machine and found savage face down on the floor with rocks on top of him.  he removed a small rock located on top of the savage’s head, but was unable to move a large rock across savage’s back.  belanger went to the no. 3 entry for help where brian mayle, continuous mining machine operator, and kenny barnett, shuttle car operator, were working.  belanger, barnett, and mayle went back to the no. 2 entry and attempted to remove the rock, but were unsuccessful.  mayle then traveled to the no. 4 entry where everly and ray were roof bolting with the no. 1 roof bolting machine.  he informed them of the accident and everly and ray went to the accident scene.  mayle continued to the power center and notified shaffer, emergency medical technician (emt), of the accident.  shaffer went to the accident scene.  mayle then called charles rhome, dispatcher, and instructed him to call 911.  everly was the first emt to arrive and administered care to savage, while the others were attempting to lift the rock by hand.monongalia emergency centralized communications agency (mecca 9-1-1) was contacted at 9:27 p.m. and notified of the accident.   shaffer instructed andy bankhead, section utility man, to prepare the emergency ride to transport the victim to the surface.  mayle notified outby section utility man, scott whitehair, of the accident.  whitehair was shoveling along the belt outby the tailpiece and he traveled to the accident scene.  belanger, barnett, and ray wrapped a nylon sling around the rock covering savage in an effort to lift the rock off of him.  they lowered the roof bolting machine atrs from the roof and placed the nylon sling around the atrs arm.  the atrs was used to lift the rock off of the victim.  whitehair and ray immediately went to get the section first aid kit.  everly and shaffer assessed savage, believing they detected a pulse, and repositioned him for placement on a backboard.  bankhead drove the emergency ride to the last open crosscut.  savage was secured to the backboard, administered oxygen and loaded on the emergency ride to travel outside.  bankhead, mayle, belanger, and shaffer accompanied savage on the emergency ride as they transported him to the surface.  when they left the section, savage’s pulse could no longer be detected.  belanger was giving savage breaths and shaffer started chest compressions, continuing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) while savage was transported to the surface.  once outside, the victim was transferred to the monongalia county ems unit who administered care to the victim.  the ambulance left the mine at 10:31 p.m.  savage was transported to ruby memorial hospital where he was pronounced dead at 10:53 p.m. by dr. venard adams, deputy chief medical examiner."

Hixon, Crusher Operator, age 45, was using a torch to cut a drill bit wedged in a jaw crusher, when the bit released and struck him.\xa0 Hixon was hospitalized and died on January 17, 2015, as a result of his injuries.\nThe accident occurred due to management’s failure to establish and implement policies and procedures to safely clear a jaw crusher.\xa0 The jaw crusher was not blocked against hazardous motion to protect miners from flying/falling materials resulting from its movement.Hixon did not receive task training on safe work procedures for clearing or dislodging material in a jaw crusher.\xa0 Specifically, he was not trained on the potential hazards resulting from a sudden release of stored energy from a jammed crusher.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'R&S Stone, Inc., a surface crushed granite operation owned and operated by R&S Stone, Inc., is located in Floyd, Floyd County, Virginia.\xa0 The principal operating official is Terry G. Reed, President.\xa0 The mine typically operates one 8‑hour shift, five days per week and employs seven persons.\xa0\nAt this operation, granite is drilled and blasted from a multiple-bench quarry.\xa0 An excavator is used to load a haul truck which transports and dumps the broken granite into a pan feeder.\xa0 The material is then fed into a jaw crusher for initial sizing.\xa0 When smaller sizes are needed, the material is conveyed to a cone crusher for further reduction.\xa0 After crushing and sizing, the material is stockpiled.\xa0 The finished products are sold as construction aggregates.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on September 11, 2014.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On Friday November 7, 2014, at approximately 2:45 p.m., Carl A. Hixon, Crusher Operator, went to check the partially filled primary jaw crusher because it was jammed.\xa0 Before checking on the problem, he de-energized the crusher and locked it out.\xa0 Hixon and Cherokee Gibson, Laborer, entered the crusher and began to manually lift rocks out of the machine.\xa0 They found that a 7-inch long by 5-inch diameter drill bit was wedged lengthwise between the jaw plates in the crusher. \xa0The crew discussed options for removal of the bit.\xa0 An attempt was made to remotely remove the drill bit from the crusher using a small backhoe to pull a chain wrapped around the bit, the drill bit would not move.\xa0 At the end of the shift, Hixon reported to the mine office and discussed the problem of removing the bit with Tammy Evans, Mine Foreman.\xa0 At about 4:00 p.m., everyone left the mine.During the weekend, Hixon and Reed worked together to install a septic system at a non-mining-related job site.\xa0 At that time, Hixon and Reed discussed the drill bit wedged in the jaw crusher at the mine.\xa0 Reed instructed Hixon to use the mine’s larger pit excavator and chains to remove the drill bit from the crusher.\xa0 Reed informed Evans of his discussions with Hixon and reiterated his instruction to use the pit excavator on the next attempt.On the day of the accident, Hixon picked up Kevin Faulkner and Cesar Martinez, Equipment Operators, at an off-site shop and took them to the mine.\xa0 They arrived at the mine at approximately 7:30 a.m.\xa0 Faulkner and Martinez went to fuel the mobile equipment while Hixon assisted Evans with the beginning of shift workplace examinations.\xa0 Hixon and Evans completed the examinations about 8:00 a.m., and Evans went to the mine office while Hixon returned to the plant.When Hixon arrived at the jaw crusher, he was joined by Faulkner, Martinez, and Thomas A. Fox, Equipment Operator.\xa0 Together, they attempted to use the backhoe one more time to remove the drill bit but were unsuccessful.\xa0 Martinez then left to grease the processing equipment while Hixon moved a service truck onto the crusher feed ramp and unrolled the truck’s onboard oxy-acetylene torch hoses.\xa0 At approximately 8:15 a.m., Hixon climbed down into the jaw crusher with the welding torch to cut the bit free. \xa0Faulkner and Fox watched Hixon from a work platform approximately 12 feet above the jaw crusher.\xa0 Martinez returned to the crusher and waited in the service truck nearby.\xa0 At approximately 8:27\xa0a.m., the stored energy (pressure) from the crusher ejected the bit and it struck Hixon.\xa0\xa0When Faulkner saw Hixon slumped over and apparently unconscious, he immediately radioed the office and requested emergency medical assistance (EMS).\xa0 Fox entered the crusher to check Hixon.\xa0 Martinez heard a loud noise, while in the truck and ran to the crusher to investigate.\xa0 When Martinez arrived at the crusher, Faulkner told him to close the regulators on the torch and then climbed into the crusher.\xa0 Reed heard Faulkner’s call for help and also ran to the crusher.\xa0 Martinez and Reed helped Fox and Faulkner pull Hixon from the crusher and administer first aid until EMS arrived.A life-flight helicopter transported Hixon to a local hospital where he was admitted in critical condition. On November 27, 2014, Hixon was transported to an extended care facility in Greensboro, North Carolina, where he died on January 17, 2015.\xa0 The cause of death was attributed to multiple blunt force trauma.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'MSHA was notified of the accident at 9:30 a.m. on November 10, 2014, by a telephone call from Terri R. Smith, Vice-President, to the National Call Center.\xa0 The National Call Center notified Kevin T. Hardester, Staff Assistant, and an investigation was started the same day.\xa0 An order was issued under Section 103(j) of the Mine Act.\xa0 After an Authorized Representative arrived at the mine site the order was later modified to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act.\xa0 A Part 50 citation was issued for untimely reporting.MSHA’s accident investigator traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident.\xa0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, mine employees, and the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals, and Energy.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Location of the Accident\nOn November 10, 2014, Hixon slid approximately 12 feet downward on a piece of rubber belting, and climbed into the jaw crusher (see Figure 1).\xa0 A noncontributory citation was issued for a violation of 30 CFR 56.11001.\xa0 Hixon was not protected from hazardous movement of either the crusher components or the drill bit while he was in the crusher.\xa0 While standing on a rock, Hixon used a torch to attempt to cut the drill bit free from between the jaw plates.\xa0 Soon after Hixon started to cut the bit, the bit was forcibly ejected from the crusher and struck him (see Figure 2).Drilling and Blasting\nBetween October 18 and October 29, 2014, Fox operated a company-owned Atlas Copco Model ROC F9-11 highwall drill for eight shifts to complete a 52‑hole pattern for subsequent blasting.\xa0 The blast holes were drilled in 9 rows to depths of 15 feet and 30 feet.\xa0 According to Fox, two drill bits were lost at the bottom of separate 30-foot deep blast holes.\xa0 After the drilling was completed, the excavator operator, the haul truck driver, and the crusher operator were instructed by Fox to watch out for the two missing bits.Austin Powder Company was contracted to conduct the blasting operation.\xa0 On October 30, 2014, at 1:16 p.m., the shot was initiated.\xa0 The contractor’s blasting report shows that the volume of material produced by the shot was 4,880\xa0cubic yards or 11,224\xa0tons.After the shot, one of the missing drill bits was found while the excavator was loading trucks.\xa0 The second bit lodged lengthwise in the primary jaw crusher.\xa0 This is the drill bit involved in the accident.\xa0 The drill bit was a 5-inch diameter by 7-inch long Model T51 DC Retractable bit, manufactured by Atlas Copco (see Figure 3). \xa0The drill bit weighed approximately 27 pounds.\xa0Lost drill bits are often found after they pass through the jaw crusher at this operation.\xa0 When interviewed, Reed stated that this was the first drill bit to get caught lengthwise between the jaw plates and jam the crusher.\xa0\xa0Jaw Crusher\nThe Model MS-3042 jaw crusher involved in the accident was manufactured in November 1995 by Minyu Machinery Corp., LTD, located in Taiwan, Republic of China.\xa0 The jaw crusher was the primary component of a portable rock crushing unit that included a vibrating rock feed table.\xa0 The complete unit was assembled in 1996 by Construction Equipment Corporation (CEC) of Lake Grove, Oregon. \xa0The unit was purchased by the current mine operator in 1998. \xa0\xa0Figure 4 shows a cross-section of the jaw crusher.Jaw Crusher Design\nThe jaw crusher is driven by an electric motor with a smaller multi-v-belt pulley driving a larger multi-v-belt pulley attached to the pitman arm shaft.\xa0 A large flywheel is mounted on the opposite end of the pitman arm shaft.\xa0 The pitman arm shaft is mounted to the crusher main frame using two large roller bearings, one on each end of the shaft.\xa0 The pitman arm (the moving part or “jaw” of the crusher) is mounted to the pitman arm shaft using two large roller bearings and the shaft can rotate freely within the pitman arm.\xa0\xa0The pitman arm shaft is designed as an eccentric, a circular disk that is solidly fixed to a rotating axle with its centre offset from that of the axle, and provides the action to crush and feed the material (rock) into the crusher.\xa0 By design, the diameter of the eccentric of the pitman arm shaft is larger than the diameter of the shaft mounted to the crusher frame.\xa0 As the shaft rotates, the eccentric portion of shaft rotates within the pitman arm.\xa0 Figure 5 is a representative illustration of the end view of the pitman arm shaft or the eccentric.The toggle plate acts as a fulcrum for the lower (lever) portion of the pitman arm.\xa0 The edges of the plate are not connected to the pitman arm or toggle block but are inside the groove of the toggle seats, one in the back of the pitman arm and one in the front of the toggle block.\xa0 The tension rods connected to the lower portion of the pitman arm are spring loaded to keep the toggle plate in position while the crusher is operating.\xa0The shim plates are steel plates of different thicknesses that are used to adjust the gap between the main frame and the bottom of the pitman arm.\xa0 The size of the gap changes the size of the crushed material leaving the bottom of the crusher.\xa0 The hydraulic cylinder attached to the main frame and toggle block is used only when changing the shim plates.\xa0 Once the toggle block bolts are loosened, the hydraulic cylinder is used to push the pitman arm away from the shims, allowing the shims to be installed or removed accordingly.\xa0 The cylinder can also be used to help retract the toggle block when retightening the bolts.\xa0 The investigators determined that a hydraulic cylinder was not installed in the crusher; however, a hydraulic cylinder is not needed to operate the crusher and its use is not recommended for clearing jams.Jaw Crusher Operation\nThe jaw crusher is used to crush large material into smaller material.\xa0 The large rotating mass of the large v-belt pulley and flywheel drives the pitman arm and creates the crushing action.\xa0 The motion of the pitman arm forces the material lower into the jaws with each shaft rotation as the material is reduced in size.\xa0 Once the material reaches the size dictated by the gap between the main frame and pitman arm, the material drops from the bottom of the crusher.\nThe Parts and Service Manual provided with the jaw crusher recommends placing material into a grizzly or other type of feeding unit to avoid overloading the crusher.\xa0 The manual also recommends using an electric overhead hoist to clear the crusher when it is jammed.\xa0 The design of this crusher does not allow for the jaws to be disengaged or otherwise opened to remove a clog or clear a jam.\nWhen the investigators asked if anyone attempted to open the jaw plates to allow the drill bit to fall through, Reed stated that, “this is an old-style jaw crusher and the jaw cannot be opened until it completes its full cycle of closure.”Weather\nOn the day of the accident, weather conditions were clear with an average temperature of 47\xa0degrees Fahrenheit.\xa0 Sunrise was at 6:54 a.m.\xa0 Weather and lighting were not considered to be contributing factors to the accident.SummaryNo blocking was used to protect the victim from hazardous movement of either the jaw crusher components or the drill bit.\nThe haul truck dumped rock directly into the pan feeder which fed the jaw crusher.\xa0 The mine operator did not use a grizzly or other recommended type of feeding unit to prevent unwanted items such as a drill bit from entering the crusher.\nThe rotating mass of the crusher applies a large amount of compressive force to any object stuck in the jaw.\xa0 When an object, such as a drill bit, is jammed in the crusher, this compressive force supplies enough energy to propel an object from the crusher when that object is loosened.\xa0\xa0\nTRAINING AND EXPERIENCECarl A. Hixon had 3 years 20 weeks of mining experience as a crusher operator, all at this mine.\xa0 The investigators reviewed the mine operator’s Part 46 training records for Hixon and found that he had received all required training with the exception of task training on removing objects jammed in the crusher.\xa0 There is no evidence that Hixon or any other miners received adequate task training on safe operating procedures related to dislodging objects stuck in the jaw crusher.ROOT CAUSE ANALYSISThe investigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified the following root causes:Root Cause:\xa0\xa0Management failed to establish policies or procedures to protect miners from hazardous motion of the jaw crusher components or objects stuck in the jaw crusher.\xa0Corrective Action:\xa0\xa0Management established policies and procedures to ensure that miners would not enter the jaw crusher to free any jammed material or objects and trained miners on these procedures.\xa0 The onsite Kobelco SK400 excavator, equipped with a 10,000 pound hammer, will be used to dislodge any items that become wedged through the crusher plates.Root Cause:\xa0\xa0Management failed to task train miners on safe procedures for dislodging objects stuck in the jaw crusher, and hazards resulting from a sudden release of stored energy from a jammed crusher.Corrective Action:\xa0\xa0Management has revised their Part 46 training plan to include task training for all miners on safe procedures for dislodging objects stuck in the jaw crusher, including the hazards resulting from a sudden release of stored energy from a jammed crusher.\xa0 All miners were trained according to the revised plan.\xa0CONCLUSION\xa0The accident occurred due to management’s failure to establish and implement policies and procedures to safely clear a jaw crusher.\xa0 The jaw crusher was not blocked against hazardous motion to protect miners from flying/falling materials resulting from its movement.\xa0Hixon did not receive task training on safe work procedures for clearing or dislodging material in a jaw crusher.\xa0 Specifically, he was not trained on the potential hazards resulting in a sudden release of stored energy from the jammed crusher.ENFORCEMENT ACTIONSIssued to R&S Stone, Inc.Order No. 8731261\xa0- Issued on November 10, 2014, under Section 103(j) of the Mine Act.\xa0 An Authorized Representative modified this order to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act upon arrival at the mine:An accident occurred at this operation on November 10, 2014, at 8:27 hours.\xa0 This order is being issued, under Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety Act of 1977, to prevent the destruction of any evidence which would assist in investigating the cause or causes of the accident. \xa0It prohibits all activity at the area of the plant where the accident occurred until MSHA deems that it is safe to resume normal operations in this area. \xa0This order was initially issued orally to the mine operator at 10:10 hours and has now been reduced to writing.\nThe initial order is modified to reflect that MSHA is now proceeding under the authority of Section 103(k) of the Federal Mine and Health Act of 1977.\xa0 This Section 103(k) Order is intended to protect the safety of all persons, including those involved in the rescue and recovery operations or investigation of the accident.\xa0 The mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an Authorized Representative of the Secretary for all actions to recover and / or restore operations in the affected area.\xa0 Additionally, the mine operator is reminded of its existing obligations to prevent the destruction of evidence that would aid in the investigating the cause or causes of the accident.\nThe order was terminated on November 12, 2014, after conditions that contributed to the accident no longer existed.\xa0Citation No. 8731264\xa0-\xa0Issued under Section 104(a) of the Mine Act for a violation of 30 CFR §\xa056.14105:A serious accident occurred at this operation on November 10, 2014 at 0827 hours, when an employee entered the jaw crusher to cut a lodged drill bit that seized the jaw crusher.\xa0 The power was locked out but the bit contained stored energy from the pressure of the jaw.\xa0 The employee bent over the bit with a torch when the bit sprang from the jaw and struck him in the chest and head.\xa0 The position of the employee did not protect him from the hazardous motion.\xa0 Failure to protect the employee from hazardous motion could lead to a fatal accident.\xa0 The employee died on January 17, 2015, as a result of his injuries.\nCitation No. 8915004\xa0-\xa0Issued under of Section 104(a) of the Mine Act for a violation of 30 CFR §\xa046.7(b):Management failed to task train miners on safe procedures for dislodging objects stuck in the jaw crusher, including the projectile hazard associated with a sudden release of stored energy.\xa0 This failure placed miners at risk and contributed to the serious accident that occurred at this operation on November 10, 2014, when a miner was seriously injured while using a torch to cut a drill bit that was wedged in a jaw crusher.\xa0 When the bit was freed, stored energy was released and the bit became a flying projectile that struck the miner. The victim was hospitalized and subsequently died on January 17, 2015, as a result of his injuries.\n\xa0Approved: _____________________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Date: __________________Kevin H.

Myers………………………...Director of Safety and Training\xa0\nJeff Ternes……………………………….Safety Team LeaderThe Mine Safety and Health Administration’s (MSHA) last regular safety and health inspection (E01) of this mine was started on July 9, 2014, and completed on September 25, 2014.\xa0 An E01 inspection was not ongoing at the time of the accident.\xa0 The 2014 non-fatal days lost (NFDL) incidence rate for North Antelope Rochelle Mine was 0.66. \xa0The national average for mines of this type was 0.98.\xa0 A miner who worked for another contractor was fatally injured at this mine on June 4, 2014.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On Saturday, October 18, 2014 at 6:45 p.m., Reimer, an employee of Dennis McCoy & Sons, Inc. (McCoy), arrived for the night shift.\xa0 He and the other crew members of the night shift met at area 101 of NARM.\xa0 They held their nightly meeting to discuss safety and receive their respective job assignments for the shift.\xa0 The miners performed their pre-operational checks.\xa0 On the pre-operational examination form filled out by Reimer for the Caterpillar 777B haul truck, company ID No. 77-08, serial No. 4XJ0023, he did not document any defects that affected the safe operation of the truck.The shift was proceeding normally until approximately 9:45 to 9:50 p.m., when Reimer, after completing his fifth load, pulled into the staging area. \xa0He turned out his truck lights and sat in his truck.\xa0 Two of the haul truck drivers checked on Reimer as they drove past his haul truck on their way to the loading area.\xa0 Both drivers reported that Reimer looked all right and driver Mike Orozco stated Reimer was sitting up, and waved as he drove past.\xa0 The second driver, Leroy Bohne, stated Reimer’s head was resting on his arm, his arm was positioned on the top of the steering wheel.\xa0 Bohne stated Reimer raised his head when he honked his horn while driving past.\xa0Victor Kirshner, Excavator Operator, made repeated attempts to contact Reimer by radio and have him pull forward, but Reimer did not answer.\xa0 Reimer remained in his haul truck, with the lights out, for 10 to 15 minutes.\xa0 At approximately 10:00 p.m., Kirshner radioed the McCoy night shift foreman, Craig Sadler, telling him there was a problem with one of his trucks.\xa0 Sadler radioed back that he was leaving the dump area and coming that way.\xa0 At that time, Reimer put his haul truck in gear, turned the wheels sharply to the left, and exited the staging area at a high rate of speed.The haul truck then traveled 2,296 feet through a top soil limit area, through a drainage ditch and over a 4 foot high berm.\xa0 The truck continued traveling south across the old top soil berm section, and went over a 3 foot high berm in the process.\xa0 The truck continued traveling south through the cast berm section and it broke through the cast berm which measured approximately 6 to 9 feet high and 32 feet wide.\xa0 The truck continued traveling in a southerly direction through the drill pattern section (cast section).\xa0 The truck traveled through the shot pattern, running over drill material 3 to 5 feet in height and over six loaded shot holes.\xa0 The truck then traveled over the north highwall of the East Elk Pit.\xa0 The left front side of the truck’s operator compartment struck the top bench of the highwall before falling to the pit bottom.\xa0 The victim was ejected at some point.\xa0 This portion of the event lasted approximately 4 minutes according to testimony. \xa0See Appendix A for the haul truck’s path of travel.A mayday call went out at 10:19 p.m., when Sadler, Harry Ruffing, McCoy Mechanic, and Trevor Frogge, Blasting Crew Member, Western Explosives Systems Company (WESCO), followed the truck tracks through the blasting area to the highwall.\xa0 They observed the truck wreckage in the bottom of the pit.\xa0 NARM management personnel and the Surface Mine Emergency Team (SMET) were called. \xa0They helped with the search, rescue, and recovery of the victim.\xa0 Some of the first to arrive were John Heimann, Overburden Supervisor, Matt Sudbeck, NARM Dragline Supervisor, and Josh Turner, Step up or Lead man.\xa0 \xa0Sudbeck and Brian McDermott, Equipment Operator NARM, were first to arrive at the bottom of the East Elk Pit.\xa0 They crawled over the berm blocking the roadway and noticed a small fire at the wreckage site from their position at the berm area.\xa0 They continued to the wreckage of the Caterpillar 777B.\xa0 Sudbeck and McDermott searched the wreckage area but they did not locate the victim at the scene.\xa0 They noticed reflective material (vest) on the highwall on a coal bench approximately 65 feet above the pit bottom.\xa0 The SMET team, led by incident commander (IC) Justin Malone, was dispatched to the scene at 10:24 p.m.\xa0 A rubber-tired bulldozer had been called to the scene earlier to breach the berm and allow rescue personnel into the pit area.\xa0 Malone and others searched the accident scene and confirmed no one was in the wreckage.\xa0 The Campbell County Sheriff’s office was notified at 10:36 p.m.\xa0 The county sheriff and rescue personnel arrived at the mine site at 10:57 p.m.\xa0 They arrived at the accident scene at approximately 11:15 p.m.\xa0 Search, rescue, and recovery operations were already in progress. \xa0The victim was recovered from a coal ledge on the highwall, which was approximately 65 feet above the pit floor.\xa0 The victim was transported from the scene by Campbell County Deputy Coroner, Gail Graham who pronounced him dead at 5:59 a.m., October 19, 2014.\xa0 An autopsy was performed by Campbell County Coroner Tom Eekhoff.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On October 18, 2014, at 11:53 p.m., the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) National Call Center received notification that a serious accident had occurred at NARM.\xa0 Sid Hansen, Coal District 9 Supervisory Mining Engineer – Roof Control, received notification on the District’s emergency call phone at 12:08 a.m., October 19, 2014. \xa0A verbal 103(j) order was issued to Duane Myers at 12:15 a.m., October 19, 2014.Citation No. 8483420 was issued to Duane Myers, NARM Director of Safety and Training, for a violation of 30 CFR § 50.10 for a failure to report this fatal accident immediately, at once, without delay, and within 15 minutes.MSHA Inspector David D. Hamilton from the Gillette, Wyoming, MSHA Field Office was dispatched to the mine.\xa0 After assessing the scene, the 103(j) order was modified to a 103(k) order to ensure the safety of all persons involved in the accident investigation.\xa0 MSHA accident investigator Gary J. Wilson was dispatched from the Price, Utah, MSHA Field Office, on October 19, 2014.Photos and measurements were taken of the route of travel of the Caterpillar 777B driven by the victim.\xa0 Hamilton began the investigation of existing physical conditions.\xa0 He also conducted initial interviews with mine personnel and McCoy personnel who were present at the scene.\xa0\n\xa0\nThe investigation of the physical aspects of the accident was completed on October 22, 2014. Digital photographs, relevant measurements, and sketches of the scene were developed as part of the investigation. \xa0The investigation included a review of training records, mine and contractor examination records, and contractor maintenance records. \xa0Interviews were conducted on October 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24, 2014, with individuals having knowledge of the accident.\nThe investigation was conducted in conjunction with the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services, State Mines Division.\xa0 Those persons who were interviewed are listed in Appendix B.', 'DISCUSSION': 'The path of the haul truckThe haul truck’s path according to an engineered report using global positioning satellite (GPS) plotting shows the following:The truck exited the staging area by taking a sharp left hand turn and traveled to the top soil limit area.\xa0 It went over the 3 foot cut where the excavator had removed the top soil.\xa0 Then the truck traveled north before making a turn to the west, and continued on a wide looping turn, eventually turning back to the south toward the staging area.\xa0 Next, the truck traveled 786 feet across the topsoil limit section, before it went over a ditch (clearing a 5 foot wide section of the ditch) and traveled through a 4 foot berm.\xa0 The truck continued traveling south 669 feet across the old topsoil berm section and went over a 3 foot high berm.\xa0 Afterwards, the truck continued traveling south 280 feet through the cast berm section. \xa0It then turned slightly to the west where it went through the cast berm, which is approximately 6 to 9 feet high and 32 feet wide.\xa0 The axle height of a Caterpillar 777B haul truck is 4 feet and 1 inch.\xa0 Next, the truck continued in a slight southwesterly direction of travel through the drill pattern section for 382 feet.\xa0 The truck continued on this route for 179 feet through the shot pattern, running over drill material 3-5 feet in height.\xa0 Lastly, the truck ran over six loaded shot holes before going over the north highwall of the East Elk Pit.Caterpillar 777B Haul TruckThe wreckage of the Caterpillar 777B haul truck was too severe for MSHA Technical Support evaluate the condition of the truck.\xa0 The maintenance records, pre-operational checks, and work orders for the McCoy equipment at this site were reviewed for any reported equipment problems.\xa0 The only maintenance record for this truck was the repair to a broken air line to the operator’s seat, on October 9, 2014.\xa0 The operator of this haul truck from the day shift (on the day of the accident) was interviewed.\xa0 He stated the truck was in sound condition and this truck was one of the best the contractor owned. \xa0After the truck was removed from the pit, the operator’s compartment was examined.\xa0 The seat belt was found unbuckled with no visible damage to the buckle or the latch.\xa0 The buckle was tested several times and the latch worked perfectly each time.\xa0 No visible damage was observed to the belt itself and no cutting or scarring was visible.Weather ConditionsThe weather was determined to not be a factor.\xa0 Clear weather and warmer than normal temperatures were present.\xa0 No inclement weather was experienced at the time of the accidentTraining and ExperienceReimer was an experienced haul truck operator, having 5 years, 42 weeks, and 6 days of experience; with 42 weeks and 6 days at this mine.\n\xa0\nTraining records were reviewed by MSHA Education Field Services training specialists Kathy Cattles and Edward C. Edwards.\xa0 They determined that the training for Reimer was current in accordance with 30 CFR § Part 48.\xa0 Reimer received new task training for the Caterpillar 777B haul truck on July 1, 2013, site specific hazard training on June 27, 2014, and annual refresher training on July 9, 2014.Illumination at Staging and Loading SiteLight plants were readily available but were not in use.\xa0 During interviews, several of the miners and the safety department stated they preferred the machine lights due to the glare of the light plants.Toxicology Report\xa0\nA blood ethanol test was performed and revealed Reimer’s ethanol level was 109 mg/dl, which equates to 0.093% blood alcohol content.\xa0 This is above the legal limit for driving in Wyoming of 0.08% blood alcohol content.\xa0 An empty pint whiskey bottle was found at the scene near the operator’s compartment.McCoy’s Program of OversightMcCoy’s drug and alcohol policy states, “The consumption of alcohol or drugs, (even some over the counter medications and prescriptions), can slow reactions, blur vision, reduce the ability to determine distance, and impair judgment.\xa0 It is, therefore, a violation of our safety policy for any employee to operate a vehicle with illegal drugs in his/her system or while impaired by alcohol, prescription drugs, or over-the-counter medications.\xa0 You must inform your supervisor if you are taking or using any prescription drug that bears a warning label.\xa0 Failure to follow this procedure is grounds for reprimand or dismissal.”Prior to the accident, McCoy’s policy included a pre-employment drug test and allowed for unannounced searches for illegal drugs or alcohol while on company property, work sites, facilities, and equipment.\xa0 The policy allowed for random drug testing any time during the working hours, and included testing for any employee who is involved in an accident.\xa0 There was no established frequency for these unannounced tests.\xa0 Any employee who violated this policy was subject to termination.Since the accident, the contractor has contracted with a third party (Gillette Employment Testing, Gillette, WY) to perform computer generated drug and alcohol testing.\xa0 They randomly test 20% of McCoy employees monthly for drug and alcohol usage.\xa0 The results of these tests are given to NARM on the 1st and 15th of each month.The spot checks performed by McCoy never indicated that the victim had used illegal drugs or alcohol.\xa0 On one occasion, the victim’s use of prescription drugs was detected, but he had a valid prescription for the drugs.NARM Program of Oversight of ContractorsPrior to the accident NARM’s policy under section 15.0 Drug and Alcohol Testing, on page 18 of the Contractor Services Agreement booklet stated:The Contractor and all sub-contractors will maintain a drug and alcohol free workplace by instituting and maintaining policies and procedures for pre-employment, random, and post-accident testing that are at least as extensive as the policies and procedures in place at Peabody for mine employees.\xa0 Failure to comply may result in penalties and work stoppage.\xa0 All levels of supervisory personnel shall know these policies and procedures.\n\xa0\nNARM safety personnel discussed the Contractor Service Agreement Booklet with the contractors prior to them working onsite.\xa0 The contractors were required to initial all areas addressed.\xa0 This agreement booklet addressed the MSHA Title 30 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), training, equipment, and other areas.\xa0 The agreement also required a Designated Safety Person to be at the site at all times.\xa0NARM conducted spot inspections on the contractors, and required the contractors to do random drug/alcohol testing with an independent tester. \xa0The results had to be provided to NARM on the first and fifteenth of the month.Since the fatal accident, NARM has instituted additional requirements including background checks of the contractor employees.\xa0 Also, training classes were held in Gillette, Wyoming on November 13, 2014, for contractors to address the drug and alcohol policies, detecting depression, and risk management.\xa0 Additional bi-monthly training classes in Gillette began on February 4, 2015, for other NARM contractors.\xa0 This training will be mandatory for the contractors.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'An analysis was conducted to identify the underlying causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 Listed below are root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions implemented to prevent a recurrence of the accident.Root Cause:\xa0 The drug and alcohol policy of contractor Dennis McCoy & Sons, Inc. was not adequate to prevent noncompliance.\n\xa0Corrective Action:\xa0\xa0The contractor has implemented an enhanced drug and alcohol testing program.\xa0 Management has implemented more intense hands on monitoring of work activities at all job areas by supervisors. \xa0This monitoring will be recorded.\nRoot Cause: \xa0NARM oversight of independent contractor Dennis McCoy & Sons was not sufficient to prevent violation of the drug and alcohol policy.\n\xa0Corrective Action:\xa0\xa0NARM management held a training meeting with their contractors on November 13, 2014, in Gillette, Wyoming.\xa0 This meeting was attended by 113 contractors.\xa0 The training addressed drug and alcohol policies, detecting depression, and risk management.\xa0 Additional training began on February 4, 2015. These classes will be taught twice monthly for all contractors.\xa0 All contractors are required to attend.\nRoot Cause:\xa0 The contractor failed to ensure seatbelts were used where there was a danger of overturning mobile equipment and that all employees were trained in the use of seat belts.\n \n\n\t\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\nCorrective Action:\xa0 The contractor has held extensive retraining classes for all employees on seat belt use while operating mobile equipment.\xa0 The contractor developed a written procedure to perform random spot checks.\xa0 Supervisors will perform random visual checks to ensure seat belts are being worn.\xa0 These checks include sub-contractors and all checks will be documented.\n', 'CONCLUSION': 'The victim was fatally injured when the vehicle he was operating went over a highwall.\xa0 The contractor’s drug and alcohol prevention program did not prevent the victim from driving while having a blood alcohol content that was greater than that allowed by the State of Wyoming.\xa0 In addition, the victim was not wearing his seatbelt.', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'A verbal 103(j) order was issued on October 19, 2014 at 12:15 a.m.\n \nThe 103(j) order was modified to a 103(k) Order, No. 8476781 and issued on October 19, 2014 at 3:00 a.m., to ensure the safety of miners until the investigation could be completed.\xa0\nCondition or Practice: An accident occurred at this operation on 10/18/2014 at approximately 10:05 p.m.\xa0 As recovery work is necessary, this order is being issued, under Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety and Healthy Act of 1977, to assure the safety of all persons at this operation.\xa0 This order is also being issued to prevent the destruction of any evidence which would assist in investigating the cause or causes of the accident.\xa0 It prohibits all activity at the bottom of the East Elk Pit from the East entrance to the coned and flagged area around the Cat 777 belly dump truck McCoy C/N 77-08, and the top of the highwall berm 400 feet from the highwall and the area 500 feet wide designated by cones and flagging, until MSHA has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in this area.\xa0 This order applies to all persons engaged in the recovery operation and any other person on-site.\xa0 This order was initially issued orally to the mine operator at 12:15 a.m. 10/19/2014 and now has been reduced to writing.\nA 104(a) Citation, No. 8483423, was issued on for a violation of 30 CFR § 77.403-1(g)\n\xa0Condition or Practice: A Caterpillar 777B haul truck, company ID No. 77-08, serial No. 4XJ0023, was involved in a fatal accident at approximately 10:05 p.m., on October 18, 2014, at the North Antelope Rochelle Mine, East Elk Pit.\xa0 30 CFR § 77.1710(i) requires seat belts where there is a danger of overturning and roll protection is provided. \xa030 CFR§ 77.403-1(g) states seat belts required by § 77.1710(i) shall be worn by the operator.

Upon completion of the #659 opening, the push beam and the cutter-head were retracted out of the opening.Between 9:00 and 9:30 a.m., the highwall mining machine was moved over to mine the #660 opening.\xa0 This opening was mined approximately 400 feet deep.\xa0 The highwall mining machine operator then retracted the push beams and the cutter-head out of the opening at approximately 3:00 p.m.\xa0 The entire crew serviced the mining machine, set bits, and greased and adjusted the cutter-head chains in preparation to start the #661 opening.At approximately 3:30 p.m., the #661 opening was started and mining had advanced approximately 70 feet when Cornett, who was operating the highwall mining machine, informed the crew that the right side motor had stopped cutting and the push beams and cutter-head would have to be retreated from the underground opening.\xa0 When the highwall mining machine was out of the opening, the crew noticed the right side cutter-head chain was missing.\xa0Newsome, Cornett, A. Cox, Newman, and Sexton gathered at the face of the opening. \xa0Utilizing a light, they saw the cutter-head chain lying near the right rib approximately 37 feet into the opening.\xa0 They discussed how to retrieve the chain from the mine opening. \xa0Cornett asked A. Cox if he was going in the opening to retrieve the chain.\xa0 A. Cox refused to go, but he told Cornett that Mize would go into the opening to connect to the chain so it could be removed from the opening.\xa0 While standing at the face of the opening, Cornett, Newsome, Newman, and Sexton were examining the roof when Mize stated to Cornett, Newsome, Newman, and Sexton that he would go into the opening to retrieve the chain.\xa0 Newsome, Newman, and Sexton insisted that the roof was too bad to go into the opening, but Mize remained firm that he could retrieve the chain.\xa0 Foreman Cornett and Mize told Sexton to find something that Mize could take into the unsupported opening to connect to the chain so that the chain could be pulled outside.\xa0 Sexton obtained a chain and straps from a truck nearby.\xa0 Cornett and Mize tied and taped the chain and straps together and Cornett instructed Sexton to get the loader and have it ready while Mize entered the opening.Cornett was standing at the entrance of the opening when Mize entered the highwall mining machine opening.\xa0 During the accident investigation interviews, no witness recalled Cornett taking any action to prohibit Mize from entering the unsupported highwall mining machine opening.\xa0 Approximately ten to fifteen seconds after Mize entered the opening, Cornett heard the roof fall.\xa0 Cornett shouted out to Mize, but received no response.\xa0 Cornett traveled into the opening to check on Mize and found that he was covered by the roof fall.\xa0 Cornett exited the opening and told A. Cox, Newsome, Newman, and Sexton that Mize was covered up and he needed their help to get him out.\xa0 Cornett instructed them to gather crib blocks, hammers, and a slate bar to help free Mize from the rock.\xa0 A. Cox, Newsome, and Sexton immediately dispersed to collect the materials while Cornett called 911.\xa0 Cornett instructed Newman to meet the ambulance at the bottom of the hill.\xa0 Newsome was fearful and refused to enter the opening.\xa0 Cornett, A. Cox, and Sexton entered the opening in an attempt to rescue Mize.\xa0 After reaching Mize’s location, they shouted outside and advised Newsome that they needed more crib blocks and a pneumatic jack to free Mize from beneath the rock. \xa0Sexton observed the roof of the opening as A. Cox and Cornett worked to free Mize from the fall and bring him outside.\xa0 Newsome retrieved the materials including a Mine Emergency Technician bag and medical supplies and placed them near the opening for use when Mize was brought outside.Cornett and A. Cox recovered Mize from beneath the rock and brought him outside from the mine opening.\xa0 Mize was unresponsive and the crew immediately began CPR. \xa0The Bell Country Ambulance Service arrived at 5:20 p.m., assumed care of Mize and subsequently transported him to Pineville Community Hospital.\xa0 He was later transported onto a helicopter to be air lifted to Holston Valley Medical Center in Kingsport, Tennessee.\xa0 Shortly after leaving the landing zone, Mize went into cardiac arrest and the flight paramedics were unable to resuscitate him.\xa0 The flight crew immediately returned to the landing zone of the Pineville Community Hospital where Mize was pronounced dead at 9:36 p.m. by Bell County Coroner, Jay Steele.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'Gary Smith, Vice President of Administration, called the National Call Center at 5:48 p.m. on October 7, 2014. \xa0The call center then notified Ryan O’Boyle, MSHA District 7 Roof Control Supervisor, of a serious accident. \xa0James Creech, Nally & Hamilton Safety Director, called Sam Creasy, Barbourville Field Office Supervisor, and David Faulkner, Coal Mine Inspector, to inform them that a serious accident had occurred at Commonwealth Mining LLC’s, Tinsley Branch Mine. \xa0A non-contributory 104(d)(1) order was issued to the company for failure to report the accident to MSHA immediately, at once, without delay, and within fifteen minutes as required by Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title §50.10.A 103(j) Order was issued verbally by MSHA Inspector Faulkner at 5:49 p.m. to ensure the safety of the miners and to preserve the accident scene. \xa0Faulkner traveled to the accident scene and upon arrival, modified the 103(j) order to a 103(k) order at 6:32 p.m. \xa0He gathered preliminary information and examined the accident scene. \xa0Argus Brock, Roof Control Specialist, was assigned as MSHA’s lead accident investigator and was dispatched to the accident site.The accident investigation and interview process were jointly conducted with personnel from the Kentucky Division of Mine Safety (KDMS) and MSHA.\xa0 Formal interviews were conducted on October 8, 2014 and October 9, 2014, at the MSHA District 7 Office. The persons who participated in the investigation are listed in Appendix A.\xa0 The persons who were interviewed are listed in Appendix B.', 'DISCUSSION': 'The mine operator utilizes a Superior Highwall Mining Machine on the surface to penetrate the coal seams and transfer the coal to the surface.\xa0 At this operation, the highwall mining machine openings created by the mining process are typically 9.5 feet wide, 3 feet high, and up to 400 feet deep.\xa0 Coal pillars or webs are left between each highwall mining machine opening to support the overburden.\xa0 At this location of the mine, the coal seams had previously been mined with a 24-inch auger mining machine to a depth of approximately 70 feet.\xa0 It is not known when these auger holes were mined.\xa0 The web spacing between the highwall mining machine openings is a minimum of 12.5 feet as specified in the acknowledged Ground Control Plan.\xa0 The maximum overburden height is 302.5 feet (see pictures in Appendix C).From the facts gathered during the investigation, the highwall mining machine opening where the accident occurred had only been driven 70 feet due to the cutter-head chain breaking. \xa0The cutter-head chain was located 37 feet from the surface into the opening.\xa0 Twelve to twenty inches of loose drawrock and cap coal was observed hanging from the roof of the highwall mining machine opening where the accident occurred.\xa0 Additionally, drawrock was present in the roof of the #659 highwall mining machine opening which was mined earlier in the shift.\xa0 Drawrock that had already fallen from the roof was also observed on the floor of the #659 highwall mining machine opening.When the victim crawled underground in an attempt to recover the broken cutter-head chain, no roof support or ground support was used.\xa0 Additionally, no roof support or ground support was used at any time while the foreman and the other two miners were attempting to rescue the victim.\xa0 At no time was roof support or ground support used to protect the victim or those who recovered the victim.Several miners stated in their interviews that there was no reason to enter the mine opening to retrieve the cutter-head chain because three to four additional cutter head chains were available on mine property at the time of the accident.\xa0 MSHA accident investigators confirmed these chains were available on mine property.\xa0 Although the victim should not have entered the mine opening for any reason, because other cutter head chains were available and could have been used, he did not need to enter the mine opening.Management KnowledgeMine management, specifically the foreman, knowingly allowed an employee to enter the highwall mining machine opening to retrieve a cutter-head chain.\xa0 The foreman also assisted other miners in preparing a chain and straps to connect to the cutter-head chain for retrieval from the opening.\xa0 Adverse roof conditions in the mine opening in the form of drawrock and cap coal were obvious.\xa0 Title 30 CFR § 77.1502 states that no miners are allowed to enter a highwall mining machine opening without a plan approved by the District Manager.\xa0 Such a plan did not exist at this mine.\xa0After the accident occurred, the foreman and two other miners entered the highwall mining machine opening to recover the victim without using any type of roof support and without prior approval of the District Manager. \xa0A non-contributory 104(d)(1) order was issued for a violation of 30 CFR §77.1502 for these miners entering a highwall mining machine opening without a plan approved by the District Manager.Interviews also indicated that there were previous occasions when the crew members associated with the operation of this highwall mining machine had entered mine openings.\xa0 A. Cox indicated that this was not the first time crew members had entered a highwall mining machine opening to retrieve a chain with the foreman’s knowledge.\xa0Experience and TrainingMize had 9 years and 26 weeks of mining experience, including 2 years and 31 weeks at this mine and at this work activity.During the accident investigation, MSHA examined the Experienced Miner and Annual Refresher training records of all of the mine operator’s employees including the victim’s training records. \xa0All training records were found to be current. However, revisions to the mine’s training plan were made as a result of the accident investigation.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'An analysis was conducted to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 During the analysis, a root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.\nListed below is the root cause identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective action implemented to prevent a recurrence of the accident:\nRoot Cause:\xa0Mine Management was present and allowed a miner to enter an unsupported highwall mining machine opening.\xa0 Mine management allowed a practice to exist where miners were entering unsupported highwall mining machine openings. The miners were not adequately trained on this subject.\nCorrective Action:\xa0 Mine Management revised the approved training plan by adding categories to assure that miners are specifically trained that no person shall be permitted to enter a highwall miner opening, except with prescribed conditions as approved by the District Manager.\xa0 Categories revised include:\xa0 New Miner Training, Experienced Miner Training, Annual Refresher Training, Task Training, and Hazard Training.\xa0\nAll miners were trained on October 21, 2014, on the new provisions of the revised training plan.\xa0 Mine management also implemented company policy regarding disciplinary actions to be taken for any employee, including foremen, who enter a highwall mining machine opening.\xa0\nCornett, who was the mine foreman at the time of the accident, is no longer a\n\n', 'CONCLUSION': 'Mine management permitted miners to enter a highwall mining machine opening without obtaining approval from the District Manager.\xa0 This resulted in fatal crushing injuries to a miner who entered an unsupported highwall mining machine opening.\xa0 A practice of allowing miners to enter unsupported highwall mining machine openings was permitted by mine management.', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'Order No. 8389194\xa0was issued to Commonwealth Mining, LLC on October 7, 2014, under the provisions of Section 103(j) of the Mine Act:\xa0An accident occurred at this operation on 10-07-2014, at approximately 16:40. \xa0As rescue and recovery work is necessary, this order is being issued, under Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, to assure the safety of all persons at this operation. \xa0This order is also being issued to prevent the destruction of any evidence which would assist in investigating the cause or causes of the accident. \xa0It prohibits all activity at the Highwall Miner Operation Pit Area, until MSHA has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in this area. \xa0This order applies to all persons engaged in the rescue and recovery operation and any other persons on-site. \xa0The order was initially issued orally to the mine operator at 17:49 and now been reduced to writing.Modified Order No. 8389194\xa0to 103(k) order at 18:32.104(d)(1) Citation No. 8382574\xa0was issued to Commonwealth Mining, LLC, for violation of 30 CFR § 77.1502Mine management, specifically the mine foreman, knowingly allowed an employee to enter the highwall mining machine opening to retrieve a cutter-head chain.\xa0 While the miner was in the opening, a rock fell from the roof striking and fatally injuring the miner.\xa0 As per 30 CFR 77.1502, no miners are allowed to enter a highwall mining machine opening without a plan approved by the District Manager.\xa0\xa0\nThis violation is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory standard.', 'APPENDIX A': 'Persons Participating in the InvestigationMine Company OfficialsName\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Title\nGary Smith...................................................................

Benoit, Mechanic, age 55, was killed while performing maintenance on a forklift in a mill building. Benoit was adjusting the directional solenoid on the transmission from the ground when the forklift began to move forward, pinning him between a wooden support pillar and the forklift’s Falling Object Protective Structure (FOPS).The accident occurred due to management’s failure to ensure that persons performed repairs and maintenance on a forklift with the power turned off and the equipment blocked against hazardous motion. The forklift’s engine was running when the operator left the seat and performed maintenance on the directional solenoid that controls the transmission. Additionally, the parking brake was not set and the wheels were not chocked to prevent movement. The victim was not effectively protected against hazardous motion.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'Hockley Mine, owned and operated by United Salt Corporation, is a single level room and pillar underground mine located near Hockley, Texas. The principal operating official is Mark F. Wiggins, Mine Manager. Fifty-six persons are employed at the mine. Sixteen persons work underground in two 10 hour shifts per day, 5 days per week. Forty persons work on the surface in three 8-hour shifts per day, 5 days per week. The surface of the mine consists of several buildings including a mill/warehouse (mill building), a maintenance shop, a hoist house, and other offices.Salt is mined by drilling and blasting. Rooms are 60 feet wide and 18 to 20 feet high. Pillars are 90 feet wide and 120 feet long. After blasting, the salt is loaded into a 22 ton haul truck that transports the salt to the primary crusher where it is crushed into four products; coarse salt, medium salt, stock salt, and feed mix salt. The products are stored underground until needed when it is hoisted to the surface and processed in bulk, sacks, or blocks for shipment. During the processing phase, sacked salt and salt blocks can also have additional minerals added prior to packaging. A majority of the salt is shipped in bulk trucks.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on August 28, 2014.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On the day of the accident, September 26, 2014, Mark G. Benoit (victim) clocked in at the mine at 5:50 a.m. Benoit was employed as a surface mechanic and typically inspected the forklifts at the mill building at the beginning of his shift as he did on the day of the accident.At approximately 6:45 a.m., Jose G. Lopez, Mineral Mixer Operator, told Benoit that the forklift he had operated the night before became inoperable and could not travel in either forward or reverse. The forklift was parked on the east side of the mill building, facing east. Benoit walked to the forklift to begin repairs. At approximately 6:50 a.m., he got a can of lubricant from Jose A. Rodriguez, Block Press Operator, who was working nearby. Benoit then was able to tram the forklift in reverse for approximately 86 feet. As he turned the forklift to the south, it became wedged against a wooden support pillar and the forklift stopped. Although the engine was still operating, the machine would not move.Benoit began repair work on the forklift in its wedged position against the wooden pillar. He removed the floorboard to access the directional solenoid attached to the transmission. Benoit stood on the left side of the forklift between the support pillar and the forklift’s FOPS while attempting to change the direction of the forklift by tapping on the solenoid cylinder. When Benoit tapped the cylinder in the forward direction, the forklift moved forward, pinning him between the support pillar and the forklift’s FOPS.Rodriguez was working nearby, heard a noise, and then turned to see Benoit pinned. He attempted to free Benoit but could not move the forklift. Rodriguez left to retrieve another forklift to pull the forklift backwards to free Benoit. He notified Roger Ramirez, Mineral Mixer Operator, of the accident. At approximately 7:08 a.m., Rodriguez and Ramirez pulled the forklift backwards, freeing Benoit.David Gonzales, Mill Supervisor, arrived at 7:10 a.m. and began Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) on the victim with Ramirez assisting. At approximately 7:11 a.m., Gonzalo Perez, Forklift Operator, called 911.At 7:25 a.m., the Waller County EMS arrived and took over the emergency procedures. James Jones, Waller County Supervisor, arrived and pronounced Benoit dead at 7:37 a.m. The cause of death was attributed to blunt trauma to the chest.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': ""MSHA was notified of the accident at 7:16 a.m. on September 26, 2014, by a telephone call from Mark Wiggins, Plant Manager, to the National Call Center. The Call Center notified Joseph O. Steichen, Assistant District Manager, and an investigation started the same day. To ensure the safety of all persons, an order was issued under provisions of section 103(j) of the Mine Act. This order was later modified to section 103(k) of the Mine Act after the arrival of an Authorized Representative at the mine site.MSHA's accident investigation team traveled to the mine, made a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, reviewed documents and evaluated work procedures relevant to the accident. MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees."", 'DISCUSSION': 'Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred just south of the block press in the mill building. The mill building has a flat cement floor.Operation ProceduresForklifts are located throughout the mill building. Two Toyota forklifts are primarily used to move pallets of salt. The TCM forklift involved in the accident is used as a backup machine to the other forklifts. Typically, a mechanic inspects all of the forklifts at the beginning of the shift. Equipment operators also conduct a preoperational inspection of a forklift prior to operating it. When a forklift needs any maintenance and can be safely operated, it is driven to the maintenance shop for repairs.ForkliftThe forklift involved in the accident is a TCM model FD30T7. It is a self-propelled, diesel powered, forklift truck with solid rubber tires and is used to move and stack pallets. The machine, manufactured in December 2006, has a maximum travel speed of 12 mph and can lift up to 6,000 lbs.The forklift is equipped with a parking brake and a service brake. The parking brake is controlled by a lever on the dashboard. The forklift has three pedals of standard automotive orientation. From left to right, they are: the clutch or inching pedal, the brake pedal, and the throttle pedal. The forklift has one forward gear and one reverse gear. An electric gear shifter is on the steering column with forward, neutral, and reverse settings.Operational Checks of the ForkliftThe forklift is equipped with a neutral start feature; when the gear selector is in forward or reverse, the forklift engine will not start. At the time of the investigation, once the machine was started and the brakes released, it was found that the forklift moved forward regardless of the setting of the gear shift. The investigators also found that the parking brake was out of adjustment. A noncontributory citation was issued.The investigators determined that tapping on the exposed plunger of the directional control valve allowed the forklift to move in the desired direction. Once the direction was manually changed with this method, the machine moved in this direction regardless of the setting of the gear selector. Additionally, the engine would start in forward or reverse gear after the plunger was manually manipulated, which defeated the neutral start feature. The investigators also found that a 10 amp fuse for the transmission was blown due to the defective solenoid.After a new solenoid operated directional control valve was installed, the forklift moved in the direction the shift lever was set and would not start in gear. The adjustment screw on the parking brake was adjusted and the forklift stayed in place when in neutral on the steepest slope it traversed.The steering and hydraulic controls were tested and functioned properly.Summary of Physical FactorsThe parking brake was out of adjustment. After adjustment, it held on the steepest grade it was used on when the engine was in neutral.\nThe parking brake held the machine in place in reverse but did not hold against the creep function in forward with the engine idle and the service brake released.\nThe solenoid operated directional control valve remained in the last position it was in despite the position of the gear shift.\nThe electrically actuated neutral start interlock verified the position of the gear shifter, not the actual gear setting of the transmission.\nThe solenoid operated directional control valve in the forklift at the time of the accident did not return to center, negating the neutral start feature.\nThe machine functioned properly when the blown fuse and the solenoid operated directional control valve were replaced and the parking brake was adjusted.\nWeatherThe weather on the morning of the accident consisted of clear skies with a temperature of 68° Fahrenheit. Weather was not considered to be a factor in the accident.', 'TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE': ""Benoit had approximately 1 year and 49 weeks of mining experience all at this mine. A representative of MSHA's Educational Field Services staff conducted a review of the mine operator's training plan and records. The required training for Benoit was up to date and in compliance with 30 CFR Part 48 requirements."", 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'The investigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified the following root cause:Root Cause:\xa0The accident occurred due to management’s failure to ensure that persons performed repairs and maintenance on a forklift with the power turned off and the equipment blocked against hazardous motion. The unblocked forklift exposed the victim to hazards associated with the potential movement of the machine.Corrective Action:\xa0Management developed safe work procedures for blocking mobile equipment against hazardous motion before persons perform maintenance. Miners were tasked trained to follow these new procedures.', 'CONCLUSION': 'The accident occurred due to management’s failure to ensure that persons performed repairs and maintenance on a forklift with the power turned off and the equipment blocked against hazardous motion. The forklift’s engine was running when the operator left the seat and performed maintenance on the directional solenoid that controls the transmission. Additionally, the parking brake was not set and the wheels were not chocked to prevent movement. The victim was not effectively protected against hazardous motion.', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'Issued to United Salt CorporationOrder No. 6315046\xa0- issued on September 26, 2014, under the provisions of section 103(j) of the Mine Act:An accident occurred at this operation on 09/26/2014 at approximately 7:10 a.m. This order is being issued, under section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, to assure the safety of all persons at this operation. This order is also being issued to prevent destruction of any evidence which would assist in investigating the cause or causes of the accident. It prohibits all activity around the area where the forklift involved in the in the accident is located in the mill building and the forklift itself until MSHA has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in this area. This order was initially issued orally to the mine operator at 7:40 a.m. and has now been reduced to writing.The order was modified to a 103(k) order after an Authorized Representative arrived at the mine.

mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'Andrian Kyle Abetya, Midnight Shift Supervisor, was provided a list of those miners reassigned to his shift, and Ramirez was on that list.\xa0 Based on Ramirez’s previous work during longwall extractions, he was assigned to David Lee Montoya, Longwall Support Supervisor, to operate the a Wagner ST-2DS (Wagner), No. 24-43 can setter, parked in the number two entry of the B Canyon Mains at crosscut No. 11. \xa0This is the intake access into the two entry longwall panel designated as 23rd East, 004-0 MMU (see Appendix A).At 12:26 a.m., Ramirez called Montoya, advising him that water was needed for the exhaust scrubber on the Wagner.\xa0 No other problems with the machine were relayed to Montoya.\xa0 At approximately 1:22 a.m., Jesse Egbert, Equipment Operator, drove a Tamrock 980L utility tractor and trailer into 23rd East from the B Canyon Mains with instructions to pick up expended utilities and pipe. \xa0The Wagner was blocking the entry one crosscut inby the corner.\xa0 Egbert honked the horn on the 980L tractor, but received no response.\xa0 About the same time, coming outby from 23rd East, Hamilton and Leon were in an Isuzu pick-up truck, also blocked by the Wagner.Egbert parked the 980L tractor and walked past the Wagner to the Isuzu pick-up.\xa0 Egbert noticed the Wagner was idling. \xa0Egbert did not see Ramirez when he passed on the off side of the Wagner. \xa0Egbert asked Hamilton and Leon if they knew where Ramirez was. \xa0Both Leon and Hamilton stated they had seen Ramirez moving a pallet into the storage entry earlier, but had not had contact with him since then.At 1:28 a.m., Hamilton tried to call Ramirez on the mine wide phone system and received no response. \xa0At about the same time, Egbert and Leon both noted a light shining under the Wagner and went to investigate. \xa0They found Ramirez in the articulation pinch point area, at the operator’s compartment entrance, with the machine pivoted in the closed position. \xa0Ramirez was observed partially out of the cab with his torso outside the machine frame.At 1:30 a.m., Egbert called Abetya, while Leon ran into the section and notified Montoya that Ramirez was injured in the Wagner. \xa0Abetya contacted Kim Ward, Conspec (atmospheric monitoring system) Operator, while driving to the accident scene.\xa0 Ward was instructed to contact the ambulance service and mine management that a serious accident had occurred.\xa0 Ward contacted East Carbon ambulance and East Carbon police at 1:36 a.m.\xa0 Sargent Phillip Holt, East Carbon police, arrived at 1:53 a.m. at approximately the same time as the ambulance.Leon and Montoya both ran outby from crosscut No. 4 to the Wagner.\xa0 Hamilton was instructed to support Ramirez’s upper body. \xa0Montoya could not reach the steering control from the operator’s access side so he went to the front of the machine and reached into the front canopy opening and articulated the Wagner open. \xa0The articulation released Ramirez’ body from the pinch point and Hamilton, Egbert, and Leon placed him on the mine floor. \xa0Hamilton returned into the 23rd East section and retrieved the section first aid kit, stretcher, and Automated External Defibrillator (AED). \xa0Abetya arrived at this time and no vitals were detected. \xa0Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), was started immediately.\xa0 The AED advised that no shock be given.CPR was continued from the underground accident scene to the surface. \xa0Shortly after reaching the surface, care of Ramirez was turned over to the paramedics when they arrived on-site at 2:03 a.m. \xa0CPR was halted when no vital signs could be detected.\xa0 Carbon County Sheriff, Sergeant David Brewer, acting in his capacity as Carbon County Medical Examiner, arrived at 2:52 a.m. and determined a time of death of 1:34 a.m., based on information he received regarding the time Ramirez was recovered.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'MSHA was notified at 2:14 a.m. \xa0A technical problem with the MSHA Call Center prevented the mine operator from being able to inform MSHA of this accident within 15 minutes.\xa0 Peter Saint, Electrical Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, verbally issued a 103(j) order at 2:35 a.m. to the mine operator.Saint notified James Preece, Acting Assistant District Manager, and Donald Durrant, Price Field Office Supervisor, who notified Vernon Marvidikis, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, of the accident.Durrant and Marvidikis arrived at the mine at approximately 5:30 a.m. \xa0Upon arrival, Durrant modified the 103(j) order to a 103(k) order to insure the safety of all persons during the accident investigation and to preserve all evidence at the accident scene. \xa0The investigation was conducted in cooperation with the Utah State Labor Commission, Office of Coal Mine Safety. \xa0Interviews were conducted with persons considered to have knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident. \xa0The accident area was surveyed with the mine engineering staff. \xa0A list of the persons who participated in the investigation is contained in Appendix B.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Accident Location23rd East is a two entry longwall headgate with conveyor belt entries.\xa0 Local geology showed an average seam thickness of 96 inches.\xa0 The seam had a 13 percent grade with the machine articulated upgrade.\xa0 The roof, rib, and floor conditions did not contribute to the accident.The pallets being handled by Ramirez held 44 crib blocks, which were eight by eight by thirty-six inches, with two pallets setting on the lower rib outby the front of the Wagner.\xa0 The Wagner that Ramirez was operating when the accident occurred had lift forks installed so it could remove pallets of cribs delivered to the No. 11 crosscut in the B Canyon mains.\xa0 The pallets were stored between the ventilation stopping at the head roller of the 23rd East longwall belt and intake access.Wagner ST-2DS Scooptram Load-Haul-Dump (LHD) Loader with Can Setter\nThe Wagner ST-2DS Scooptram load-haul-dump (LHD) unit was manufactured in 1989.\xa0 The Wagner was purchased as a used LHD in 2003 with two other ST-2DS’s.\xa0 In 2007, West Ridge applied for and was granted a field modification for the Wagner to have greater versatility in mine production work. \xa0It was originally equipped with a 2-yard ejector bucket, which had a hydraulically movable plate that pushes material out of the bucket.Behind the longwall face, the mine installed secondary roof supports called “cans.”\xa0 These were mild steel cylinders filled with an air-entrained concrete. \xa0Cans were manufactured in 18, 24, or 36-inch diameters, and of the length necessary to match the entry height. \xa0The Wagner had equipment that would pick-up cans, carry them to the installation site, rotate to vertical, and set the can in place. \xa0Miners then secured each can in place with caps and wedges. \xa0West Ridge adapted the Wagner with a bulk paper roll lifting clamp that was suited for the can installation requirements, made by Cascade Clamp, Mfg.The third modification option for the Wagner was a set of lift forks similar to the forks on a forklift. \xa0Prior to the accident, can setting was finished and pallets of crib block were brought into the longwall as additional roof support where cans could not be installed. \xa0The Wagner was in this configuration at the time of the accident.The Wagner consisted of two major sections with an articulation joint between them.\xa0 The front section included the can setter, forks or a 2-yard bucket, lift boom, hydraulic cylinders, front drive axle, and operator\'s compartment.\xa0 The rear section included the engine, torque converter, transmission, rear drive axle, exhaust scrubber and fire suppression system.\xa0This four-wheel drive LHD was powered by a Caterpillar 3304 PCNA, diesel engine, with a four-speed transmission for both the forward and reverse directions.\xa0 Fourth gear was blocked out.The LHD was equipped with an air actuated, hydraulic braking system at each wheel, applied with an air treadle valve mounted at the foot pedal.\xa0 There was a second braking system for emergency and parking brakes. \xa0This system was spring applied and hydraulically released.\xa0 It had multiple wet discs and was built into the transmission.The weekly examination for the LHD, required under 30 CFR § 75.1914(f), was completed at approximately 9:00 a.m. on September 15, 2014, without any defects or hazardous conditions noted.Accident investigators found the Wagner’s transmission forward/reverse control arm in the neutral position, the gear selector in the “first” gear position, the park brake set, and the headlight switch in the ""rear on"" position.Machine\'s Operator CompartmentThe operator\'s seat and compartment was oriented on the left side of the machine, adjacent to the forward wheel assembly.\xa0 The operator sat perpendicular to the direction of travel in a semi-reclined position, and looked left for forward travel, and looked right when traveling in reverse.\xa0 There was no door on the operator\'s compartment side access which was open to the articulation area.\xa0 The Wagner was not provided with a restraint system that would keep the operator within the confines of the operator’s compartment.\xa0 It is not known why the victim was partially outside of the operator’s compartment.All hydraulic controls were mounted within the compartment for steering, boom control, and can setter control.\xa0 After the modification, the boom lift and bucket levers operated similar functions for the can setter clamp.\xa0 Additional levers operated the rotation and clamping of the can setter.\xa0 All were readily accessible.\xa0A manual park brake release was included in the operator’s compartment.\xa0The operational gauges, air toggle lever, system override, diesel motor air start buttons, brake release, and a hand held fire extinguisher, were mounted on the rear section at arm’s length.\xa0 All gauges functioned as required.\xa0 The certified canopy was adjusted to its lowest setting, restricting the operator’s view to the rear.The service brake pedal was located to the left of the throttle pedal in standard automotive orientation.\xa0 Both pedals were tested and moved freely.\xa0 Spring returned them when released without obstruction.\xa0The steering was controlled by a ½ inch “Mono Control” joystick type rod with a plastic knob threaded on its end that traveled up or down in a slotted guard.\xa0 The joystick was spring-centered and caused right and left machine articulation movement with the speed of articulation being proportional to the lever displacement and motor speed.\xa0 With the joystick in the down position, the Wagner turned left in forward travel.\xa0A hinged, forked mechanical steering lock was added to the joystick guard. \xa0Its intent was to hold the joystick in the centered position.Equipment TestingTo complete the site investigation, the Wagner involved in the accident was inspected to facilitate function testing. \xa0Multiple machine mechanical and safety deficiencies required repairing, before the Wagner could be tested.Once repaired for testing, the machine was able to articulate fully to the left as it did in the accident. To articulate, the machine had to overcome the fact that the park brake was set, friction from contact with the mine floor, and turn up hill against the 13 percent grade. \xa0The Wagner was articulated to the left multiple times to show the positon and closure necessary to simulate the condition that occurred during the accident.\xa0 It took an average of 28 seconds to close to the steering stops. \xa0The gap between the operator’s compartment frame to the water tank frame, when fully articulated to the left to the steering stops, measured 3 ½ inches (see Appendix C).At some point in time, after original manufacturing and prior to West Ridge’s purchase, metal blocks were added to the original steering stops at the articulation frame that increased the closure distance between frames, so that a miner could potentially not be crushed if his body was in the articulation area. The off side steering stop plate was measured at 4 ¼ inch long by 2 ¼ inches wide and estimated to be ½ inch thick.\xa0 When examined, the operator’s side forward steering stop was missing.\xa0 This allowed the closure, frame to frame, at the pinch point where the victim became entrapped.\xa0 These steering stops were not original to the machine when manufactured (see Appendix C).After testing was completed, the Wagner was determined to be unsafe to drive out of the mine and that it needed to be towed.\xa0 Both Wagner LHDs were removed from the 23rd West sections and were taken to and secured in the mine’s surface shop.\xa0 Gary Clark, Mechanical Engineer MSHA Approval and Certification Center, and Dwayne Brown, Coal Mine Safety and Health Diesel Specialist, inspected both operating Wagner LHD’s using the Wagner/Atlas Copco inspection criteria.When examined immediately during the accident investigation, the following defects were found;The inspection/access cover on the side of the fuel tank was leaking diesel fuel. Diesel fuel was dripping from the machine onto the mine floor.\n \nThe fork lift attachment keeper pin was not installed.\xa0 The pin was sitting in front of the operator’s compartment.\n \nThe manual park brake release system would not pump up and manually release the brakes with the engine not running. \xa0The park brake tow valve did not automatically return to the park brake applied position when released as required by the equipment manufacturer.\n \nThe high engine temperature shutdown valve did not shut the machine’s engine down at 212 degrees or lower.\n \nThe low scrubber water shutdown level did not shut the machine’s engine down at the proper level.\n \nThe low engine oil pressure shutdown system did not function properly when tested.\n \nIn addition to the safety defects, accumulations of combustible materials in the form of coal, coal fines, oil, diesel fuel, oil and diesel fuel soaked coal had been allowed to accumulate on the Wagner.\xa0 When examined, oil and oil soaked coal covered the main hydraulic tank, front and side of the transmission, and the boom and front frame of the machine.\xa0 Diesel fuel and fuel soaked coal, approximately 1 inch in depth, was on and around the machine’s diesel fuel tank.\xa0 A puddle of diesel fuel was noticed under the machine.\n \nA primary defect directly related to the accident was found with the steering control joystick. \xa0Due to the loss of the original plastic steering knob, a modified handle assembly was made.\xa0 This improvisation consisted of adding at the ½ inch threaded end of the control rod a ½ to ⅜ inch pipe bell reducer.\xa0 Inserted into the ½ inch end of the pipe bell reducer was a ⅝ inch eye or ring type lift bolt.\xa0 Since the threads didn’t match, electrical tape was wrapped around the control rod and attachments to hold everything in place.\xa0 When removed, the control rod, eye bolt, pipe fitting, and tape weighed 15.2 ounces.\xa0 The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) knob weighed about 1 ounce.\xa0 As the handle assembly loosened, more tape was wrapped until it was 1.315 inch in diameter, (0.77 inch wider than the steering interlock), and extended from in the guard plate slot to the base of the ring.\xa0 The addition of multiple layers of tape created a frictional contact with the guard which, when combined with the added weight of the assembly, held the steering Mono Control rod down in the left articulating position.\n \nThe operator’s side forward steering stop was missing.\nMSHA’s specialists determined the numerous violative conditions on the Wagner were obvious and had, with a high degree of probability, been in place prior to when the accident occurred.West Ridge Equipment ExaminationsWest Ridge mine maintenance personnel received their initial 30 CFR § 75.1915(a) diesel certification training off site from Randy Tatton,\xa0owner of Mining Health and Safety Solutions, Inc.\xa0 Mine specific, follow-up training was completed by the mechanics during an on the job training (OJT) period.\xa0 The West Ridge training utilized Wagner and Atlas Copco examination check off sheets as training materials, (Atlas Copco purchased Wagner Mfg.).\xa0 Once trained, mechanics were assigned specific diesel equipment for the required the 30 CFR § 75.1915(f) inspections.\xa0 A review of diesel mechanic training records indicated the training was completed for those mechanics currently assigned to repair and perform 30 CFR § 75.1914(f) examinations and tests of the diesel fleet operating at West Ridge Mine.On September 15th at approximately 9:00 a.m., Richard Evans, Certified Diesel Mechanic, was assisting Darren Bradley, Certified Diesel Mechanic, with the changing of a carrier bearing on the second Wagner ST-2DS can setter, company number 5.\xa0 The second can setter was in the face area of the 23rd West.\xa0 The Wagner involved in the accident, number 24-43, was being operated as a fork lift in the same area.\xa0 Evans stated he was assigned to the 24-43 Wagner for weekly examinations.\xa0 When Evans saw the 24-43 unit operating near the #5 Wagner, he stopped it and performed the required 30 CFR § 75.1914(f) examination for the week.\xa0 During the interview of Evans, he stated that he did not see anything out of order on the 24-43 Wagner and recorded this in the weekly diesel record.\xa0 That examination was later recorded in the mine’s weekly diesel examination record as “ok.”\xa0 Accident investigators reviewed weekly permissibility records back to August 24, 2014, and found that the only defects noted were fire suppression caps being replaced and the scrubber being shut down so that adjustments could be made.Company policy required Wagner operators to conduct a pre-operational examinations to comply with 30 CFR § 75.1914(e). \xa0The company directed examiners to fill out a company provided examination card which would show the operating condition of the Wagner.\xa0 Once examined, the pre-operational examination card was forwarded to management. \xa0For each shift, one of these cards should have been filled out for the Wagner that was operated.West Ridge miners randomly submitted these examination cards.\xa0 The records of these pre-operational examinations were not comprehensive for the shifts that Wagners were operated.\xa0 The accident investigation team reviewed the previous six months of Wagner pre-operational examination records, (March to September 2014), including those done by Ramirez.\xa0 Those records that were available for review generally did not contain defects listed that affected safety.During the two shifts prior to the accident, the 24-43 Wagner was used to handle pallets at the same location Ramirez was assigned.\xa0 Pre-operational examination cards, filled out on the day shift and swing shift on September 15th, by mobile equipment operators Josh Patterson and Zeb Farmer, showed no defects on the machine.The mine operator’s preventative maintenance of the diesel equipment at this mine lacked comprehensive oversight.\xa0 When asked how long the steering rod had not been maintained, as described above, Travis Graves, Maintenance Manager, and Evans the diesel mechanic assigned to conduct weekly examinations on the Wagner, stated they did not know.\xa0 When asked if they could remember the modified handle assembly ever not being on the steering rod, they both replied “No.”The Wagner non-compliance should have been obvious to a trained examiner.\xa0 The observations of accident investigators showed that this mobile diesel equipment, continuously operated in a mining environment, was not maintained as well as the pre-operational examination cards and weekly permissibility records indicated.\xa0 The defects found were both contributory and non-contributory to the accident. \xa0Both Wagner can setters required several days of repair work, underground and in the surface shop, to make them compliant with 30 CFR § 75.1914.Work Experience and TrainingAlejandro Ramirez (victim) was employed as an experienced miner from Price Mine Services in 2007. His resume states he had “Qualifications” as, among other jobs, a “Can Setter.”\xa0 Ramirez initially worked at the mine before it became West Ridge in August 2008.\xa0 He received initial training on the Wagner ST-2DS on May 5, 2007, with training performed by Randy Hunt, Foreman.\n\xa0\xa0\nAt West Ridge, Ramirez received additional task training in longwall recovery support activities in 2013 and twice in 2014.\xa0 This included training on installing roof support for shield extraction, and equipment operations related to the longwall mining machine removal and installation.From March 2009 through September 2014, West Ridge moved their longwall mining machine 14 times. Records show that Ramirez operated mobile equipment, including, but not limited to, the Wagner can setters on most moves.Interviews with West Ridge management and task trainers support the fact that Ramirez was proficient when operating the can setter.MSHA Education Field Services further conducted a review of the training of all persons with involvement in the accident. \xa0ToxicologyToxicology did not indicate anything abnormal in the victim.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'A root cause analysis was conducted to identify the causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \xa0Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions implemented to prevent a reoccurrence of the accident.Root Cause:\xa0 Mine management failed to ensure that proper pre-operational examinations were completed prior to diesel equipment being placed into service. \xa0The Wagner involved in the fatal accident was found with a major steering defect after the two most recent pre-operational examinations were conducted and no defects were found.\nCorrective Action: \xa0Management has instituted a more comprehensive preventative maintenance program that addresses repair and examination requirements, including monitoring the weekly and pre-operational examinations.\xa0 The training has been completed. \xa0Accountability for the equipment inspections has been emphasized in a new, written program.\nRoot Cause: \xa0Mine management failed to ensure a proper and comprehensive weekly exam was properly performed.\nCorrective Action: \xa0Management has instituted a more comprehensive preventative maintenance program that addresses repair and examination requirements, including monitoring the weekly and pre-operational examinations.\xa0 Training has been completed.\xa0 Accountability for the equipment inspections has been emphasized in a new, written program.\n', 'CONCLUSION': 'The fatal accident occurred when the victim’s upper body was outside the operator’s compartment as the machine articulated.\xa0 Contributing to the accident was a history of significantly deficient pre-operational and weekly examinations.\xa0 If these examinations had been performed correctly, the Wagner would have been required to be removed from service and repaired prior to the accident.', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': ""A 103(k) order was issued on September 16, 2014.\nA fatal injury occurred in the 23rd East Long Wall Section, MMU 003. \xa0The miner was fatally injured by being caught in the pivot point of the ST 2DS Wagner Can setter Company # 24 -4 3, Serial # SA032l8 . A verbal 103(j) order was issued to withdraw the miners from the mine and thereby protect the health , safety and life of any person and to preserve any evidence.\xa0 This verbal issuance is now reduced to writing.\nSafeguard 8483141 was issued on October 2, 2014, pursuant to 30 CFR § 75.1403\n\xa0The Wagner ST-2DS Tractor/Scoop was not provided with a system to keep all miners body parts within the safety confines of the operators cab.\xa0 The mine had a fatal accident related to the miner's body being extended beyond the confines of the operator’s compartment and into the articulation pinch point, thereby receiving crushing injuries.\nThe Wagner ST-2DS Tractor/Scoop has multiple functions, depending on which attachment is employed, to include, but not limited: LHD Scoop with two yard bucket, Fork Lift, and Can Setter.\xa0 The units traverse or work on a grade that averages 12 percent.\nThis is a Notice to Provide Safeguards requiring all Wagner ST-2DS Tractors/Scoops, without regard to configuration, to be provided with a means to restrain equipment operators to the confines of the operators cab and all of the components must be maintained in usable and operative condition.\xa0 No one is allowed to enter or exit the cab when the pump motors are running.\nStandard 75.1403 was cited 6 times in two years at mine 4202233 (6 to the operator, 0

1:39 a.m., an underground, mobile equipment operator was fatally injured when the Wagner ST-2DS (S/N SA03P02l7, Company No. 24-43, Approval no. 31-116-1), mobile diesel can setter he was operating, articulated and crushed him.\xa0 The steering assembly in the operator's compartment was not properly maintained.\xa0 Original steering components included a ½ inch rod extended through a slotted, convex guard plate with a knob threaded on to the end of the rod.\xa0 When the knob was lost, a ½ to ⅜ inch pipe bell reducer was installed on the end of the rod.\xa0 Also, a ⅝ inch ring lift bolt was installed in the bell reducer.\xa0 The threads didn't match so plastic tape was wrapped around the control rod, bell reducer, and ring lift bolt to hold everything in place.\nAs the improvised assembly loosened, more tape was wrapped until the assembly was 1.315 inch in diameter and the tape extended from the guard plate slot to the base of the ring.\xa0 A frictional contact between the tape and convex guard was created.\xa0 This frictional contact combined with the weight of the improvised assembly, held the steering rod down in the left articulating position.\xa0 When removed and weighed, the control rod, eye bolt, pipe fitting, and tape weighed 15.2 ounces, whereas the manufacturer’s knob only weighed about 1 ounce.\xa0 This condition contributed to the accident.\nOnce the added material was removed, the steering rod was re-tested and found to function according to the manufacturer’s specifications.\nThe mine operator engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence in that he failed to conduct adequate examinations according to 30 CFR, the manufacturer's examination criteria, and the company's examination criteria.\xa0 The mine operator also accepted a condition that contributed to the accident, which existed for several weeks.\xa0 This condition was obvious to the certified mechanics who conducted the required examinations, but no measures were taken to document or remove this hazard.\xa0 Instead, miners were assigned to operate the machinery in the defective condition after the inadequate examinations were conducted.\nThis violation is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory standard.\n104(d)(1) order 8483150 was issued for a violation of 30 CFR § 75.1914(f)(1)\n\xa0An inadequate weekly examination was conducted on the Wagner ST-2DS (S/N SA03P02l7, Company No. 24-43, Approval no. 31-116-1) mobile diesel can setter for the calendar week of September 14 to 20, 2014.\xa0 The weekly examination was conducted on September 15, 2014, at approximately 9:00 a.m. and the examiner documented that no defects were found during this examination.\nThe equipment operator was fatally injured on September 16, 2014, when this mobile diesel can setter articulated and crushed him.\nDuring the fatal accident investigation, this machine was inspected and found to have a significant safety hazard (see reference

ramirez was on that list.  based on ramirez’s previous work during longwall extractions, he was assigned to david lee montoya, longwall support supervisor, to operate the a wagner st-2ds (wagner), no. 24-43 can setter, parked in the number two entry of the b canyon mains at crosscut no. 11.  this is the intake access into the two entry longwall panel designated as 23rd east, 004-0 mmu (see appendix a).at 12:26 a.m., ramirez called montoya, advising him that water was needed for the exhaust scrubber on the wagner.  no other problems with the machine were relayed to montoya.  at approximately 1:22 a.m., jesse egbert, equipment operator, drove a tamrock 980l utility tractor and trailer into 23rd east from the b canyon mains with instructions to pick up expended utilities and pipe.  the wagner was blocking the entry one crosscut inby the corner.  egbert honked the horn on the 980l tractor, but received no response.  about the same time, coming outby from 23rd east, hamilton and leon were in an isuzu pick-up truck, also blocked by the wagner.egbert parked the 980l tractor and walked past the wagner to the isuzu pick-up.  egbert noticed the wagner was idling.  egbert did not see ramirez when he passed on the off side of the wagner.  egbert asked hamilton and leon if they knew where ramirez was.  both leon and hamilton stated they had seen ramirez moving a pallet into the storage entry earlier, but had not had contact with him since then.at 1:28 a.m., hamilton tried to call ramirez on the mine wide phone system and received no response.  at about the same time, egbert and leon both noted a light shining under the wagner and went to investigate.  they found ramirez in the articulation pinch point area, at the operator’s compartment entrance, with the machine pivoted in the closed position.  ramirez was observed partially out of the cab with his torso outside the machine frame.at 1:30 a.m., egbert called abetya, while leon ran into the section and notified montoya that ramirez was injured in the wagner.  abetya contacted kim ward, conspec (atmospheric monitoring system) operator, while driving to the accident scene.  ward was instructed to contact the ambulance service and mine management that a serious accident had occurred.  ward contacted east carbon ambulance and east carbon police at 1:36 a.m.  sargent phillip holt, east carbon police, arrived at 1:53 a.m. at approximately the same time as the ambulance.leon and montoya both ran outby from crosscut no. 4 to the wagner.  hamilton was instructed to support ramirez’s upper body.  montoya could not reach the steering control from the operator’s access side so he went to the front of the machine and reached into the front canopy opening and articulated the wagner open.  the articulation released ramirez’ body from the pinch point and hamilton, egbert, and leon placed him on the mine floor.  hamilton returned into the 23rd east section and retrieved the section first aid kit, stretcher, and automated external defibrillator (aed).  abetya arrived at this time and no vitals were detected.  cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr), was started immediately.  the aed advised that no shock be given.cpr was continued from the underground accident scene to the surface.  shortly after reaching the surface, care of ramirez was turned over to the paramedics when they arrived on-site at 2:03 a.m.  cpr was halted when no vital signs could be detected.  carbon county sheriff, sergeant david brewer, acting in his capacity as carbon county medical examiner, arrived at 2:52 a.m. and determined a time of death of 1:34 a.m., based on information he received regarding the time ramirez was recovered."

The victim had been assigned to level a bench for drilling.The bulldozer operator failed to maintain full control of his equipment while it was in motion in close proximity to the edge of the highwall. The victim was not wearing his seat belt.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'The Manchester Mine is owned and operated by Black Warrior Minerals, Inc. and is located in Jasper, Walker County, Alabama. The mine has 37 employees, and operates two 10-hour shifts (6:00 am to 4:00 pm and 4:00 pm to 2:00 am), Monday through Friday.The mine has one active pit. The mine is a surface bituminous coal operation, utilizing typical drill and shoot methods to break the overburden. This operation utilizes a Hitachi 1200 Excavator and two Caterpillar 992C front-end loaders to remove the overburden. The highwall in the area of the accident ranges from 50 to 60 feet in height. Once the overburden is removed, the coal seams are excavated utilizing front-end loaders and coal haulage trucks. The primary coal seams mined are the Jefferson and Lick Creek seams, averaging a total of approximately 28 inches in thickness. The daily production averages 840 tons.The principal officials of the mine at the time of the accident were:The principal officials for the mine at the time of the accident were:Roger W. Perry........................Chairman\nRance D. Perry.......................President/Treasurer\nLeah M. Perry-Haynie..............Secretary\nRehana Perry.........................Staff Assistant\nJerry W. Aaron.......................Mine Superintendent\nThe last regular safety and health inspection was completed by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) on July 9, 2014. The mine’s Non-Fatal Days Lost (NFDL) incidence rate for 2013 was 1.71, compared to the national rate of .99 for mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On Monday, September 15, 2014 Barry N. Duncan (victim) arrived at the mine for the day shift at approximately 5:00 am and traveled directly to his work area. Duncan was assigned to continue completion of a drill bench which he had been working on his prior shift.Duncan’s method for creating the bench was to push material to the edge of the bench, in effect creating a berm, which kept his bulldozer from getting close to the highwall edge. He continued to push material to the edge of the bench, keeping a berm, while also pushing material off the bench into the pit. Typically, Duncan moved his bulldozer perpendicular to the edge of the highwall while he was pushing the material.As the remainder of the day shift employees arrived and throughout the day, Duncan carried on small talk over the citizen’s band (CB) radio with the other equipment operators. Some of the other equipment operators observed Duncan working on the bench throughout the shift, but never observed anything unusual.At approximately 12:40 p.m., the bulldozer operated by Duncan traveled over the highwall and fell approximately 50 feet to the Jefferson bench below. The bulldozer came to rest in the upright position. Johnnie Turner, Excavator Operator, noticed a cloud of dust in the area where Duncan was working and attempted to call Duncan over the CB radio several times with no response. Turner then called over the CB for mine personnel to investigate.Barry Gilbreath, Rock Truck Operator, was the first to arrive at the accident scene. He found the victim on the floor of the bulldozer cab, not wearing his seatbelt, with his head face down in the operator’s seat, unresponsive, and without vital signs. B.J. Myers and Gary Benson, Rock Truck Operators, arrived and started CPR. The coworkers called for medical assistance.First responders from the Thach Volunteer Fire Department relieved mine personnel and continued CPR on the victim. An Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) was attached to the victim and indicated that the first responders should continue with CPR. Regional Paramedics of Jasper arrived and continued the efforts to revive the victim. The paramedics applied an electrocardiogram (EKG) and determined that there were no vital signs. Efforts to revive the victim were stopped and the coroner was called.J.C. Poe, Walker County Coroner, arrived and pronounced the victim dead at 2:04 pm, September 15, 2014.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'At approximately 12:50 pm, Jerry Aaron, Mine Superintendent, notified Coal Mine Inspector, Dean Harbin, of the accident. Harbin was conducting an inspection on mine property at the time of the accident. Harbin met Aaron at the accident scene. Harbin issued a 103(k) order to ensure the safety of all persons and to prevent the destruction of evidence during the accident investigation. Harbin called Jacky Shubert, Bessemer Field Office Supervisor, and advised him of the accident. Shubert replied that he would send an MSHA accident investigator to conduct the investigation. Bessemer Field Office Supervisor, Ed Boylen and Coal Mine Inspector, James Brodeur were dispatched to the mine. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) Call Center was notified of the accident at approximately 1:24 pm, on Monday, September 15, 2014, when Aaron placed the call.Harbin conducted a preliminary examination of the accident scene. Photographs and observations were made of the bulldozer’s route of travel, resting place at the bottom of highwall, and the general condition of the highwall. Boylen and Brodeur arrived on site, began an investigation, and conducted initial interviews with mine employees. A physical examination of the Caterpillar D9L Bulldozer, company number 2 was conducted by Harbin and Brodeur.The investigation was conducted in conjunction with the State of Alabama Department of Labor Inspections Division, Thompson Tractor Company Service Department, mine management, and employees from the mine. Those persons participating in the investigation are listed in Appendix A. Persons interviewed are listed in the Appendix B.The investigation of the physical site of the accident was completed on September 17, 2014. Digital photographs, sketches, and relevant measurements, including a topographic survey of the accident area prepared by Perc Engineering Company, were developed as part of the investigation. The topographic survey is shown in Appendix C. The investigation also included a review of training records, mine and equipment and mine examinations records, and maintenance records. Additional interviews were conducted with persons who had knowledge of the accident on September 16 and 30, 2014. The interviews revealed that there were no eyewitnesses to the accident.The physical examination and function tests performed on the Caterpillar Bulldozer were completed on September 30, 2014. Operational pressure tests for machine speed, brakes, and steering were performed by Morris Campbell, Thompson Tractor Company Service Technician. Thompson Tractor Company, Inc., the regional Caterpillar distributer, is contracted by the mine to provide mine site service and maintenance support of the mine’s equipment.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Accident Site ObservationsThe accident scene consisted of a highwall in which the upper bench was being prepared for the drilling phase of the mining cycle. The lower pit level had already been mined. The highwall measured 55 feet in the area where the bulldozer traveled off the highwall. There were no cracks in the bench floor or areas where the highwall had broken. The inspection of the highwall revealed no evidence of ground failure. The weather conditions did not contribute to the accident. The day was a mostly cloudy with a temperature of 84 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The bench area was dry.The upper level of the highwall was in the construction phase. The investigation showed that normal mining practices were used in clearing and leveling the bench for drilling. A portion of the berm was not left on the edge of the bench, which was the area where the bulldozer traveled over the highwall.On the push by the bulldozer when the accident occurred, there was a gouge in the bench floor close to the edge of the highwall. The bulldozer blade was dropped down when it should have been level or been raised prior to the bulldozer backing up for another push. The last push was the only location on the bench that showed evidence of this occurrence and was a change in the method of bulldozer’s operation during the last push, as compared to the rest of the bench.EquipmentThe bulldozer was a Caterpillar D9L Bulldozer, serial no. 14Y3133. The bulldozer weighs approximately 126,600 pounds and has a turbocharged 12-cylinder engine with approximately 460 horsepower at the flywheel. The bulldozer has three forward gears and three reverse gears. The speed of the bulldozer going forward is as follows: 2.5 miles per hour (mph) in first gear, 4.5 mph in second gear, and 7.5 mph in third gear. The speed of the bulldozer going in reverse is as follows: 3.1 mph in first gear, 5.4 mph in second gear and 9.3 mph in third gear. The bulldozer was in neutral with the engine running when coworkers arrived at the accident site.The bulldozer is equipped with Roll-Over Protective Structure (ROPS). Although there were no eye witnesses to the accident, the post-accident condition of the bulldozer showed evidence of a rollover. There was damage to the exhaust stack, air pre-breather, lights around the cab, and dents in the cab frame. All windows were either broken out or damaged, and dirt was impacted inside of the operator’s cab. Additionally, the seat belt in the bulldozer was in the retracted position and was partially covered with dirt. There was no evidence to indicate that the victim was wearing the seat belt at the time of the accident.Pre-operational Equipment Checks and MaintenanceThe mine operator requires that a pre-operational check list be filled out by all equipment operators on every shift. All pre-operational check lists for the two weeks prior to the accident were reviewed. There were no hazards or problems reported for the bulldozer. During the investigation of the accident site and bulldozer, the bulldozer pre-operational check record for Monday, September 15, 2014 could not be located. There were no mechanical problems with the bulldozer listed in any record that was reviewed.A review was conducted of approximately the previous six months of the service/repair records for the bulldozer involved in the accident, and there was no evidence of any hazards or problems.Field Testing of BulldozerThere were no problems identified with the bulldozer steering, brakes, transmission, or engine decelerator control system. This bulldozer model had no electronic control module which would store diagnostic information. Manual diagnostic tests were performed by a service technician of Thompson Tractor Company, Inc. Pressure gauges were connected to the bulldozer ports to test the oil pressures of the speed clutch, forward and reverse direction clutches, brake pedal, left and right brake levers, and left and right steering clutch levers. Test results are attached in Appendix D. There was no evidence that an operational issue existed with the bulldozer at the time of the accident.Work Experience and TrainingThe victim was an experienced bulldozer operator, having approximately 28 years of mining experience, with 15 years at this mine (see Appendix E).An examination of training records revealed Duncan received required training in accordance with 30 CFR Part 48. Duncan received annual refresher training on May 10, 2014. Duncan received task training for a D9L bulldozer in 2002.Additional InformationThe Walker County Coroner listed the cause of death on the Alabama Certificate of Death as blunt force open head trauma due to a mining accident. No autopsy was performed on the victim.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'A root cause analysis was conducted to identify the most basic causes of the accident, which could have been corrected through reasonable management controls. The following root causes, if corrected, could have prevented the accident or mitigated the outcome:Root Cause:\xa0The mine operator failed to ensure that the bulldozer operator maintained full control of his machine while in motion and while working in close proximity to the edge of an existing highwall.Corrective Action:\xa0The mine operator retrained all personnel on maintaining full control of their machine at all times and on the proper techniques of preventing over travel of a highwall or any areas of the mine where the machine may fall and/or turnover. A record of the training conducted was provided to MSHA.Root Cause:\xa0The mine operator failed to ensure that seatbelts were used where there is a danger of overturning equipment.Corrective Action:\xa0The mine operator retrained all personnel on wearing the machine’s seat belt at all times where there is a danger of overturning equipment when the machine is in motion. A record of the training conducted was provided to MSHA.', 'CONCLUSION': 'The accident occurred because the bulldozer operator failed to maintain full control of his equipment while it was in motion in close proximity to the edge of an existing highwall. In addition, the victim was not wearing his seat belt where there was a danger of the equipment overturning.', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'Violation Type:\xa0103(k) Order:Condition Description:\xa0A fatal accident occurred at this operation on September 15, 2014, at approximately 12:45 p.m. As rescue and recovery work is necessary, this order is being issued under Section 103(k) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 to assure the safety of all persons at this operation.

He was attempting to retrieve wooden planks from the rafters in a bag storage building.The accident occurred due to management’s failure to establish and implement procedures for persons to safely access materials stored in the bag storage building. Additionally, Dibble did not receive task training addressing safe work procedures for accessing overhead areas and the potential hazards associated with the task.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'Gardenscape of New York, a surface crushed limestone operation owned and operated by Gardenscape of New York, is located in Gouverneur, St. Lawrence County, New York. The principal operating officials are David G. Kasmoch, President, and Kevin Dibble, Plant Manager (victim’s cousin). The mine typically operates two 10 hour shifts, five days per week. Total employment is 20 persons. Most of the miners work on dayshift from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. while a 3-person night shift works from 3:45 p.m. to 1:15 a.m.Limestone is drilled and blasted from a multiple-bench quarry. A front-end loader is used to load a haul truck which transports the broken limestone to a primary feed hopper for processing. The primary crushing plant consists of a grizzly-type vibrating feeder and a jaw crusher with an under jaw discharge conveyor. The crushed material is conveyed to a scalping screen. The undersized material flows to a conveyor and the oversized material falls into a cone crusher at the secondary plant for additional crushing. When the material exits the secondary plant, it is conveyed to the mill for further reduction. The material is stored in bulk or dried for subsequent bagging. Finished products are sold as bulk or bagged agricultural lime.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this mine on July 23, 2014.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On the day of the accident, Monday August 25, 2014, Glenn F. Dibble (G. Dibble, victim) reported for work at 7:30 a.m., his usual starting time. G. Dibble was instructed by Kevin Dibble (K. Dibble), Plant Manager, to haul five to six loads of sand from a nearby mine. During the morning, coworkers observed G. Dibble hauling several loads of material in an over-the-road dump truck.At approximately 12:30 p.m., Murlyn Harris, Front-end Loader Operator, loaded G. Dibble’s truck with crusher run material to be delivered off site.At about 2:00 p.m., the secondary crushing plant shut down with a full load of material in the cone crusher. The cone crusher needed to be emptied before the plant could be restarted. Derek Collier, Crusher Operator, Jeff Jenkins, Plant Operator/Shift Supervisor, and Harris decided to use chains and slings connected to a front-end loader in an attempt to lift the crusher and allow material to flow through.At approximately 3:00 p.m., Harris observed G. Dibble return to the mine and park his dump truck. About 3:15 p.m., G. Dibble stopped by to assist with the work on the cone crusher. G. Dibble stated that they would need several wooden planks to prevent material from flowing from the stone hopper into the crusher. G. Dibble then stated that he knew where the planks were and left in a pickup truck and traveled toward the bag storage building.At 3:45 p.m., the 3-person nightshift crew gathered in the breakroom, punched their timecards, and traveled to the milling plant. The crew consisted of two bagging machine operators and an operator/machine tender.When the work on the cone crusher was completed, Collier, Jenkins, and Harris went to the breakroom to punch out for the shift. Harris noticed that G. Dibble had not returned and assumed that K. Dibble had sent him on some errands. The dayshift crew left the mine at 4:00 p.m.On Tuesday, August 26, 2014, at 1:25 a.m., the nightshift crew returned to the breakroom at the end of the shift. At that time, they noticed that G. Dibble’s motorcycle helmet was on the table in the breakroom. Darren House, Bagger, looked outside and saw that G. Dibble’s motorcycle was parked behind the breakroom. Nicholas Trapp, Bagger, noticed that the pickup truck was not parked near the shop as it normally was during nightshift. At that time, Steven Spano, Operator/Machine Tender, checked G. Dibble’s timecard and noticed he had not punched out at the end of dayshift. According to interviews, they assumed G. Dibble’s motorcycle did not start and he had taken the pickup truck home. The nightshift crew left the mine at 1:45 a.m.Harris arrived at the mine at 5:12 a.m. and waited in the breakroom for the rest of the dayshift crew to arrive. While waiting, he noticed G. Dibble’s motorcycle helmet was still on the table in the breakroom. At 6:00 a.m., Harris and Collier punched their time cards and decided to look for G. Dibble. They saw the pickup truck sitting near the bag storage building, went inside, and found G. Dibble lying between two loaded pallets. He was unresponsive and had no vital signs. They immediately called the local authorities and K. Dibble to report the accident. The New York State Police and the St. Lawrence County Coroner responded to the mine. At 7:30 a.m., the victim was pronounced dead at the scene by Kevin Crosby, St. Lawrence County Coroner. The cause of death was attributed to blunt force trauma.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'MSHA was notified of the accident at 6:19 a.m. on August 26, 2014, by a telephone call from Derek Collier, Crusher Operator, to the National Call Center. The National Call Center notified Victor Lescznske, Supervisory Special Investigator, and an investigation was started the same day. An order was issued under provisions of Section 103(j) of the Mine Act. This order was later modified to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act after the arrival of an Authorized Representative at the mine site.MSHA’s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident. MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, employees, and state law enforcement.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred in the bag storage building on the east end of the mine. The structure is a three-sided enclosure built to store and shelter stacked pallets of new bags and other materials needed for the mine (see Figure 1). The earthen floor is covered with fine gravel and free of debris. Wire mesh bag support columns for the onsite dust collectors and wooden planks are stored in the building’s rafters approximately 12 feet from ground level.WeatherOn the day of the accident, weather conditions were clear with an average temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit and wind approximately 6 mph. Sunrise was at 6:18 a.m. The investigators determined that the weather conditions and lighting were not contributing factors in the accident.Physical FactorsThe evidence gathered during the investigation indicated that the victim had climbed approximately 8 feet on top of two stacked pallets and reached for wooden planks in the rafters above him (see Figures 2 and 3). Each wooden plank was approximately 2 inches thick by 12-inches wide by 12 feet long and weighed 30 pounds. The victim had taken down two wooden planks before falling to the ground.', 'TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE': ""Glenn Dibble had 1½ years of mining experience as a truck driver, all at this mine. A representative of MSHA's Educational Field Services reviewed the mine operator’s Part 46 training records for G. Dibble. Although the records documented that G. Dibble had received all required training, including task training and annual refresher training, he did not receive task training addressing safe work procedures for accessing overhead areas and the potential hazards associated with the task."", 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'Root Cause:\xa0Management failed to provide a safe means of access for miners retrieving stored materials from the overhead rafters in the bag storage building.Corrective Action:\xa0All materials were removed from the overhead rafters and stored in a safe manner. In addition, management established written policies and safe work procedures, including the use of ladders for any work being performed overhead. Miners were trained in the new policies and procedures.Root Cause:\xa0Management failed to provide the victim, an over-the-road truck driver, sufficient task training addressing safe access and safe work procedures while performing additional duties at the mine.Corrective Action:\xa0Management has revised their Part 46 training plan to include task training for over-the-road truckers who may perform additional duties at the mine. All truck drivers were trained in accordance with the revised plan.', 'CONCLUSION': 'The accident occurred due to management’s failure to establish and implement procedures for persons to safely access materials stored in the bag storage building. Additionally, G. Dibble did not receive task training addressing safe work procedures for accessing overhead areas and the potential hazards associated with the task.', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'Issued to Gardenscape of New YorkOrder No. 8802348\xa0- Issued on August 26, 2014, under the provisions of Section 103(j) of the Mine Act.

the Pocahontas No. 3 Seam.\xa0 The seam averages 6 feet in height.\xa0 Four fans exhausting 2.4 million cubic feet of air per minute provide ventilation.\xa0 Laboratory analysis of return air samples shows a methane liberation rate of 9.3 million cubic feet per day through the main mine fans.\xa0 The development units are ventilated using a split system with exhausting line curtains or auxiliary fans and ventilation tubing.\xa0\nThe mine employs a total of 402 underground and 65 surface miners working three shifts per day, two production shifts and a maintenance shift, five days per week.\xa0 The evening shift is designated as a maintenance shift.\xa0 The mine produces an average of 17,600 tons of raw material daily from six continuous mining machine units and one longwall unit.\xa0 Six continuous mining machine Mechanized Mining Units (MMUs) comprise three super sections where two units operate side-by-side and dump coal at the same section loading point.\xa0 Coal is transported from the faces by battery-powered ram cars, freedom cars (battery-powered shuttle cars), and a longwall face conveyor.\xa0 The coal is then transported to the production shaft bottom by belt conveyors, stored in underground bunkers, and hoisted to the surface by skip hoist cars.\xa0 Employees and materials are transported in and out of the mine via man hoists and underground travel is facilitated by a diesel-powered track haulage system.\xa0\nThe super sections support longwall mining.\xa0 Longwall panels are developed 750 feet wide by 11,500 feet long.\xa0 At the time of the accident, mining was ongoing on the 3 super sections and the longwall.\n\xa0\nPrior to the accident, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular health and safety inspection of the mine on June 26, 2014.\xa0 A regular safety and health inspection started on July 1, 2014, and was ongoing at the time of the accident.\xa0 The Non-Fatal Days Lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for the mine in 2013 was 0.56 compared to a National NFDL rate of 3.28 for mines of this type.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On August 20, 2014, the mine was conducting normal mining operations.\xa0 Coal production started on the 24 Right super section (013 and 014 MMUs) on the midnight shift and continued into the day shift.\xa0 The 24 Right day shift crew arrived on the section at approximately 8:20 a.m.\xa0 Rick Koger, Section Electrician, started his daily routine of placing calibration gas on the methane monitor for the right side continuous mining machine.\xa0 Koger then went to the right side roof bolting machine located in the No. 3 entry inby survey station No. 31596 to test the methane sensors on the roof bolting machine.\xa0 The roof bolting machines at this mine are equipped with a methane monitor that has dual sensors; one sensor is located underneath each operator’s drill canopy.\xa0 According to Koger, both the right side continuous mining machine and the right side roof bolting machine functioned properly when calibration gas was applied to the methane monitor sensors.\xa0 After he completed the checks on the roof bolting machine, Koger started to walk away.\xa0 One of the roof bolting machine operators called for him to come back. \xa0Koger was told that the roof bolting machine would not start.\xa0 Koger started troubleshooting the roof bolting machine.\xa0 Koger stated that he took the cover off the largest explosion proof enclosure (see Appendix A) on the roof bolting machine in order to troubleshoot the electrical circuits.\xa0 Koger found a blown fuse and a broken resistor wire.\xa0 He determined that the blown fuse and broken resistor wire did not correct the startup problem.\xa0 At no time did Koger or anyone else deenergize the power for this roof bolting machine at the power center.Some outby maintenance supervisors are also assigned to oversee a mining section as part of their normal duties.\xa0 Those maintenance supervisors travel to the sections on a regular basis to assist the section electricians.\xa0 Justice, a Maintenance Supervisor, was assigned to the 24 Right section (see Appendix B).\xa0 On the day of the accident, Justice traveled to the section as part of his normal duties.\xa0 Justice entered the mine at approximately 7:52 a.m.\xa0 He walked to the maintenance area and traveled by diesel powered man bus (track) to the 24 Right section.\xa0 Justice arrived on the section at approximately 9:20 a.m.\xa0 When Justice arrived on the section, he learned that the roof bolting machine was not operating.\xa0 Justice traveled the No. 3 entry to the right side roof bolting machine to assist Koger with troubleshooting and electrical work on the roof bolting machine.\xa0 Koger told Justice what he had done and they both discussed the next steps to be taken.\xa0 Justice then directed Koger to get an IS relay from the parts sled for the emergency stop circuit.At this time, Justice performed electrical work, instead of troubleshooting, when the IS relay was removed and a new relay was installed.\xa0 After replacing the IS relay, it was determined that the relay was not the problem.\xa0 Justice instructed Koger to go to the methane monitor power supply and open the electrical enclosure for further troubleshooting.\xa0 The methane monitor power supply electrical enclosure was located in the center toward the front of the walk-through roof bolting machine.\xa0 At some point, Justice placed the circuit breaker, which was inside the largest explosion proof enclosure of the roof bolting machine, in the “off” position and replaced the IS relay with the original relay he had taken out earlier (see Appendix C).It is believed that Justice was trying to put the relay retainer bands in place when he came into contact with the loose strands of the red phase lead or the connection lug on the line side of the breaker.\xa0 This contact put 346 VAC from the tip of his left hand ring finger through his body to ground.\xa0 The 346 VAC is the phase-to-ground voltage of a 600 VAC three-phase circuit.Koger walked to the methane monitor power supply and was preparing to remove the cover of the electrical enclosure.\xa0 He heard Justice make a noise.\xa0 Koger stated he turned and ran out of the walkway to the back of the roof bolting machine and observed that Justice appeared to be in contact with an energized electrical circuit.\xa0 According to Koger, Justice was on his knees and appeared to have both hands inside the panel board of the roof bolting machine.\xa0 Koger ran to Justice and kicked him, to knock him away from the energized circuit of the roof bolting machine.\xa0 Koger stated that when kicked, Justice was not knocked away from the machine, but Koger believed that Justice had been freed from the energized circuit.\xa0 Koger then grabbed Justice by the shoulders and pulled him to the ground.\xa0 Koger stated that he did not feel an electrical shock when he grabbed Justice.Greg Burress, Roof Bolting Machine Operator, was also near the roof bolting machine when the accident happened. \xa0Burress yelled for help.\xa0 Terry Hamilton, Section Foreman, and Luke Stull, Geologist, were located just outby the roof bolting machine in the intersection and heard Burress.\xa0 Hamilton came to the accident scene and started first aid.\xa0 Tim LaForce, Continuous Miner Coordinator, was notified of the accident by Stull, and they arrived at the scene shortly after Hamilton.\xa0 Burress left to get first aid supplies.\xa0 Todd Keen, Roof Bolting Machine Operator, went to the mine phone to request an ambulance. \xa0On his way back to the accident scene, Keen met Roby Thomas, Left Side Continuous Mining Machine Operator, with the Automatic External Defibrillator (AED).\xa0 Keen took the AED to the accident scene. \xa0While first aid was being rendered, the AED was placed on Justice.\xa0 The AED recommended one shock, which was given.\xa0 The AED did not recommend any further shocks.\xa0 Jackie Horn, Right Side Continuous Mining Machine Operator, Burress, LaForce, and Keen continued administering first aid.\xa0 Daniel Smith, Roof Bolting Machine Operator, went to obtain track clearance and prepare a man bus to transport the victim to the surface.\xa0 LaForce instructed Hamilton to go to the mine phone at the power center, notify management,\xa0 \xa0and make sure the track was clear from the 24 Right section to the Horn Mountain shaft bottom. \xa0Hamilton met Anthony Cook, Scoop Operator, and directed him to make sure the roadway between the No. 3 entry and the supply hole was clear and to take the scoop to the No. 3 entry where the victim was located. \xa0Justice was secured on a backboard, loaded into the bucket of the scoop, and transported to the man bus. \xa0Justice was then transported on the man bus to the Horn Mountain shaft bottom.\xa0 LaForce, Keen, Burress, and Horn continued performing CPR on the victim during transport while Smith operated the man bus.\xa0Mercy Ambulance Service was notified of the accident at approximately 10:29 a.m.\xa0 The ambulance arrived at the mine site at approximately 10:55 a.m.\xa0 At approximately 11:20 a.m., the man trip arrived on the shaft bottom with Justice and the EMTs from the ambulance service took over resuscitation efforts.\xa0 They continued CPR and transferred Justice to the top of the shaft and into the ambulance.\xa0 They left the mine at approximately 11:53 a.m. and transported Justice to Clinch Valley Medical Center, Richlands, Virginia, arriving at approximately 12:16 p.m.\xa0 The emergency room physician, Dr. Ben Kerny, pronounced Michael Justice dead at 12:29 p.m.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On August 20, 2014, at 11:03 a.m., Quintin Justice, Mine Engineer, called the MSHA toll free number to inform MSHA of the accident.\xa0 A citation was issued because MSHA was not notified immediately, at once, without delay, and within 15 minutes.Personnel from the MSHA Hotline contacted Scott Beverly, Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, at 11:10 a.m.\xa0 A copy of the MSHA Escalation Report was sent to Beverly.\xa0 Information concerning the accident was gathered and an accident investigation team was assembled.\xa0 The team consisted of Dennis Shortt, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector (Electrical Specialist); Mark Deel, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector (Health Specialist); and Jason Hess, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector (Ventilation Specialist).\xa0 Shortt was designated the lead accident investigator.\xa0Cornelius Simmons, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector and Shortt were underground at the Buchanan Mine when the accident occurred. \xa0Shortt was located at 23 Right longwall belt drive area and Simmons was on the 25 Right section. \xa0Simmons traveled to the 24 Right section and assisted with the investigation.\xa0\nJames Kiser, Assistant District Manager; Delmer Hess, Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector; Michael Colley, Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, along with Simmons, were located on the 25 Right section at the time of the accident. \xa0D. Hess was informed by Ray Kinder, Mine Foreman that a miner was found unresponsive on 24 Right section.\xa0 D. Hess directed Danny Atwell, Mine Superintendent, to locate Shortt and have Shortt meet D. Hess at the mouth of 24 Right.\xa0 Atwell called Eric Vandyke, Maintenance Supervisor, who was traveling with Shortt, and informed Shortt that there had been an accident and requested Shortt meet D. Hess at the mouth of 24 Right section.\xa0 At 11:00 a.m., Shortt issued a 103(k) order verbally to Ray Kinder, Mine Foreman.\xa0 The order was issued to ensure the health and safety of persons in the affected areas of the mine until the accident investigation could be completed.\xa0 J. Hess arrived at the mine and traveled underground to the accident scene with personnel from the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy (DMME).Officials from CONSOL Buchanan Mining Company LLC, DMME, and MSHA participated in the accident investigation at the mine (see Appendix D).\xa0 On August 20 and 25, 2014, the investigation team collected information, examined the accident scene, and took photographs of the affected area.\xa0 The accident investigation team obtained the circuit breaker associated with the fatal accident to examine and test it under laboratory conditions. \xa0\xa0Fred Martin, Educational Field Services (EFS) examined the victim’s training records.MSHA and DMME conducted joint interviews with 15 miners on August 21 and 22, 2014, at the CONSOL office located at Oakwood, Virginia.\xa0 Those persons interviewed are listed in Appendix D.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Physical FactorsThe accident occurred in the No. 3 heading approximately 127 feet inby survey station No. 31596 on the 24 Right section off 3 East Mains, 014-0 MMU.\xa0 The section consisted of 4 entries.\xa0 Entries No. 2 and 3 provide intake air to ventilate the section.\xa0 Entries No. 1 and No. 4 are used for air returning from the section.The section, including the area around the accident site was dry to damp.\xa0 The accident site was relatively flat and level with a roof height of approximately 7.8 feet.\xa0 The roof and ribs in this area were generally smooth.The victim’s work gloves were located on top of the area light at the operator’s deck of the roof bolting machine.\xa0 The Fluke multimeter located at the accident scene belonged to Koger.\xa0 The multimeter was set on “Ohms” to measure resistance, and was not being used at the time of the accident. \xa0A Fluke non-contact voltage tester was also located at the scene.During the investigation, it was determined that the roof bolting machine’s onboard circuit breaker had wiring deficiencies.\xa0 The connection of the red phase lead (closest to the IS relay) to the line side of the circuit breaker had several strands of copper wire protruding out of the connection lug and one strand of the wire protruding toward the IS control relay on which the victim was working.\xa0 The IS relay was located approximately 1½ inches from the copper strand.\xa0 Also, the white phase lead (farthest from the IS relay) was not properly installed in the connection lug.\xa0 There were strands of wire protruding around the connection lug and the lead was loose in the lug which caused heating and damage to the insulation (See photographs in the Appendices).It is believed that Justice was trying to put the relay retainer bands in place when he contacted the energized circuit because this was the next step in the process of installing the IS relay. \xa0These bands were very close to the energized circuit, and this was what the victim was working on according to Koger and evidence at the scene of the accident.When the new circuit breaker was installed, approximately 7 to 10 inches of the white phase lead had to be removed in order to access the portion of the lead that was not damaged by heating.\xa0 The protruding wire strands of the red phase lead were one possible contact point. \xa0The autopsy indicated two thermal injuries to the tip of the ring finger of Justice’s left hand – a 2 centimeter blister and one 0.9 centimeter blister.\xa0The investigation further determined that the original cause of the electrical problem was a defective panic strip located at the left side of the roof bolting machine operator’s position.\xa0 MSHA electrical specialist, Lincous Gary Perkins, oversaw the post-accident troubleshooting and repair.Troubleshooting and Electrical Work\xa0\nTroubleshooting or testing is the process of locating electrical problems and verifying that proper repairs have been made.\xa0 In contrast, electrical work is installing, repairing, or replacing electrical equipment, components, or conductors.\xa0 Electrical work requires the electrician to first perform lock out and tag out procedures.Justice began troubleshooting and reportedly thought that the IS relay was defective.\xa0 According to interviews, the victim removed the original IS relay and installed a replacement IS relay.\xa0 He then removed the replacement IS relay and installed the original IS relay.\xa0 It is believed that when the accident occurred, the victim had just re-installed the original IS relay and was attempting to place the relay retainer bands over the IS relay and continue with the troubleshooting process.\xa0Before the victim secured the IS relay in place, by placing the relay retainer bands over the IS relay, he should have traveled to the section power center (located approximately 563 feet outby the roof bolting machine in the No. 3 entry), de-energized the circuit breaker, removed the cable coupler or plug from the receptacle on the power center to establish visually that the circuit was de-energized and disconnected, and locked out and tagged out the visual disconnect (cable coupler).\xa0 When the victim broke the plane of the explosion proof enclosure for the purpose of securing the IS relay, he was no longer troubleshooting but was doing electrical work.Each time the victim broke the plane of the explosion proof enclosure to replace the IS relay, he should have first de-energized the circuit breaker, removed the cable coupler, and locked out and tagged out the cable coupler at the section power center prior to doing this electrical work.\xa0 He should have repeated this process each time he removed and replaced the IS relay.EquipmentThe roof bolting machine involved in the accident was manufactured by J.H. Fletcher & Co., type DDR-15-A, serial number 2009101, with MSHA Approval No. 2G-2956A-6.\xa0 The nominal input voltage to the roof bolting machine is 600 volts, 3-phase, and 60 hertz. \xa0A No. 2 American Wire Gage (AWG) trailing cable was used to supply power to the walk thru roof bolting machine.\xa0 During operation, the roof bolting machine utilizes a cable reel to spool cable on and off the roof bolting machine. \xa0The roof bolting machine is equipped with metal track-type crawlers to move.\xa0 The explosion proof box cover, which covers the electrical components in the box, is 16 ½ inches tall and located on the right side (off side) with the bottom approximately 22 inches above the mine floor.\xa0 The original equipment manufacturer provides a 250 amp circuit breaker with a trip range of 500 to 1,000 amps.\xa0 The circuit breaker that was in the roof bolting machine at the time of the accident was a 250 amp circuit breaker with a trip range of 875 to 1,750 amps.\xa0 The IS relay being worked on by the victim was located approximately 36 inches above the mine floor.\xa0Testing\nExamination of the onboard circuit breaker was conducted on September 16 and September 17, 2014, at the MSHA Approval and Certification Center (A&CC) in Triadelphia, West Virginia.\xa0 The examination of the circuit breaker did verify eight deficiencies; however, none of the deficiencies found indicated that the circuit breaker contributed to the accident.\xa0 The examination verified that there were several conductor strands of #26 AWG that were not captured in the terminal lug closest to the IS control relay on which the victim was working.\xa0Mine Examinations\nThe pre-shift and on-shift records for the 24 Right section (013 and 014 MMUs) were found to be up-to-date.\xa0 No significant entries were recorded for the midnight shift pre-shift examination on the day of the accident related to the accident scene.The last weekly electrical examination record for the right roof bolting machine was up-to-date.\xa0 The “Examination of Electrical Equipment” record book showed the right roof bolting machine was last examined on August 19, 2014.\xa0 The record book lists a Hazardous Condition of “Place in cable needed additional tape.” The Action Taken for correction showed “Taped.”\xa0Experience and TrainingMichael Justice was hired on July 26, 2010 and received experienced miner training at Buchanan Mine #1 on August 2, 2010. \xa0He had nineteen years, three weeks, and four days of mining experience.\xa0 He had four years, two weeks and four days with CONSOL Buchanan Mining Company, LLC, and two years, fifteen weeks as a Maintenance Supervisor at the mine. \xa0Justice’s training was current and he was properly certified by the DMME and qualified by MSHA to perform duties as an underground electrician. \xa0He completed Underground Electrical Repairmen retraining on September 30, 2013. \xa0In addition to the required training, CONSOL Buchanan Mining Company, LLC had a program in place at the time of the accident to evaluate electricians on their skill and knowledge of regulations, including “Lock and Tag Out.”\xa0 The victim had a Certificate of Task Training and Observation Form completed for a “Full Cycle Observation “on June 2, 2014, for “Lock and Tag Out.”\xa0 Company records show at least 21 different Certificates of Task Training and Observation Forms had been completed for him since he was hired for “Lock and Tag Out.”\xa0In 2014, Justice trained three electricians in proper lock and tag out procedures, and observed the lock and tag out practices of these electricians.\xa0 Koger was one of these electricians. \xa0Training and Observation forms were completed for these sessions.Before the fatal accident, the company did not have a written policy clearly defining the difference between performing electrical troubleshooting and performing electrical work.\xa0 The company has since modified its training program to clearly define the difference between electrical troubleshooting and electrical work.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'An analysis was conducted to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 During the analysis a root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective action implemented to prevent a recurrence of the accident:Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator failed to follow well established and well known safe electrical work requirements. Additionally, the mine operator’s programs, policies and procedures were not sufficient to prevent miners from working on energized electrical equipment without first locking and tagging out the equipment before electrical work is started.Corrective Action:\xa0 The mine operator modified its training program to clearly define the difference between performing electrical troubleshooting and performing electrical work.\xa0 All miners were retrained on the differences between performing troubleshooting and electrical work.\xa0 Troubleshooting training included glove requirements at specific voltages.\xa0 Electrical work training included lock out, tag out procedures. \xa0The mine’s Part 48 training program was revised to include specific training of the items above in the Task Training section.In addition, a managerial oversight program was implemented by the mine operator to ensure that the mine operator’s policies, procedures and programs are followed by the miners.', 'CONCLUSION': 'The victim did not de-energize, lock out, and tag out the visual disconnecting device on an electrical circuit prior to performing electrical work on that circuit.\xa0 The non-workmanlike and deficient installation of the conductors on the circuit breaker may have been an indirect cause of the accident.\xa0 The victim was performing electrical work inside the energized explosion proof enclosure when he came in contact with either the line side connection lug for the red phase lead to the circuit breaker or with strand(s) of No. 2 AWG wires protruding from that connection lug.\xa0 The company’s programs, policies, and procedures that were in place at the time of the accident failed to prevent this accident.\xa0Approved:\xa0\xa0\xa0______________________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0

operations.  coal production started on the 24 right super section (013 and 014 mmus) on the midnight shift and continued into the day shift.  the 24 right day shift crew arrived on the section at approximately 8:20 a.m.  rick koger, section electrician, started his daily routine of placing calibration gas on the methane monitor for the right side continuous mining machine.  koger then went to the right side roof bolting machine located in the no. 3 entry inby survey station no. 31596 to test the methane sensors on the roof bolting machine.  the roof bolting machines at this mine are equipped with a methane monitor that has dual sensors; one sensor is located underneath each operator’s drill canopy.  according to koger, both the right side continuous mining machine and the right side roof bolting machine functioned properly when calibration gas was applied to the methane monitor sensors.  after he completed the checks on the roof bolting machine, koger started to walk away.  one of the roof bolting machine operators called for him to come back.  koger was told that the roof bolting machine would not start.  koger started troubleshooting the roof bolting machine.  koger stated that he took the cover off the largest explosion proof enclosure (see appendix a) on the roof bolting machine in order to troubleshoot the electrical circuits.  koger found a blown fuse and a broken resistor wire.  he determined that the blown fuse and broken resistor wire did not correct the startup problem.  at no time did koger or anyone else deenergize the power for this roof bolting machine at the power center.some outby maintenance supervisors are also assigned to oversee a mining section as part of their normal duties.  those maintenance supervisors travel to the sections on a regular basis to assist the section electricians.  justice, a maintenance supervisor, was assigned to the 24 right section (see appendix b).  on the day of the accident, justice traveled to the section as part of his normal duties.  justice entered the mine at approximately 7:52 a.m.  he walked to the maintenance area and traveled by diesel powered man bus (track) to the 24 right section.  justice arrived on the section at approximately 9:20 a.m.  when justice arrived on the section, he learned that the roof bolting machine was not operating.  justice traveled the no. 3 entry to the right side roof bolting machine to assist koger with troubleshooting and electrical work on the roof bolting machine.  koger told justice what he had done and they both discussed the next steps to be taken.  justice then directed koger to get an is relay from the parts sled for the emergency stop circuit.at this time, justice performed electrical work, instead of troubleshooting, when the is relay was removed and a new relay was installed.  after replacing the is relay, it was determined that the relay was not the problem.  justice instructed koger to go to the methane monitor power supply and open the electrical enclosure for further troubleshooting.  the methane monitor power supply electrical enclosure was located in the center toward the front of the walk-through roof bolting machine.  at some point, justice placed the circuit breaker, which was inside the largest explosion proof enclosure of the roof bolting machine, in the “off” position and replaced the is relay with the original relay he had taken out earlier (see appendix c).it is believed that justice was trying to put the relay retainer bands in place when he came into contact with the loose strands of the red phase lead or the connection lug on the line side of the breaker.  this contact put 346 vac from the tip of his left hand ring finger through his body to ground.  the 346 vac is the phase-to-ground voltage of a 600 vac three-phase circuit.koger walked to the methane monitor power supply and was preparing to remove the cover of the electrical enclosure.  he heard justice make a noise.  koger stated he turned and ran out of the walkway to the back of the roof bolting machine and observed that justice appeared to be in contact with an energized electrical circuit.  according to koger, justice was on his knees and appeared to have both hands inside the panel board of the roof bolting machine.  koger ran to justice and kicked him, to knock him away from the energized circuit of the roof bolting machine.  koger stated that when kicked, justice was not knocked away from the machine, but koger believed that justice had been freed from the energized circuit.  koger then grabbed justice by the shoulders and pulled him to the ground.  koger stated that he did not feel an electrical shock when he grabbed justice.greg burress, roof bolting machine operator, was also near the roof bolting machine when the accident happened.  burress yelled for help.  terry hamilton, section foreman, and luke stull, geologist, were located just outby the roof bolting machine in the intersection and heard burress.  hamilton came to the accident scene and started first aid.  tim laforce, continuous miner coordinator, was notified of the accident by stull, and they arrived at the scene shortly after hamilton.  burress left to get first aid supplies.  todd keen, roof bolting machine operator, went to the mine phone to request an ambulance.  on his way back to the accident scene, keen met roby thomas, left side continuous mining machine operator, with the automatic external defibrillator (aed).  keen took the aed to the accident scene.  while first aid was being rendered, the aed was placed on justice.  the aed recommended one shock, which was given.  the aed did not recommend any further shocks.  jackie horn, right side continuous mining machine operator, burress, laforce, and keen continued administering first aid.  daniel smith, roof bolting machine operator, went to obtain track clearance and prepare a man bus to transport the victim to the surface.  laforce instructed hamilton to go to the mine phone at the power center, notify management,   and make sure the track was clear from the 24 right section to the horn mountain shaft bottom.  hamilton met anthony cook, scoop operator, and directed him to make sure the roadway between the no. 3 entry and the supply hole was clear and to take the scoop to the no. 3 entry where the victim was located.  justice was secured on a backboard, loaded into the bucket of the scoop, and transported to the man bus.  justice was then transported on the man bus to the horn mountain shaft bottom.  laforce, keen, burress, and horn continued performing cpr on the victim during transport while smith operated the man bus. mercy ambulance service was notified of the accident at approximately 10:29 a.m.  the ambulance arrived at the mine site at approximately 10:55 a.m.  at approximately 11:20 a.m., the man trip arrived on the shaft bottom with justice and the emts from the ambulance service took over resuscitation efforts.  they continued cpr and transferred justice to the top of the shaft and into the ambulance.  they left the mine at approximately 11:53 a.m. and transported justice to clinch valley medical center, richlands, virginia, arriving at approximately 12:16 p.m.  the emergency room physician, dr. ben kerny, pronounced michael justice dead at 12:29 p.m."

Pierce, Southeast District Manager\n', 'OVERVIEW': 'Kyle Martin, Assistant Plant Manager, age 28, was killed on July 21, 2014, when an aluminum boat he was riding in became stuck in shallow water on top of 480 volt energized power conductors.Martin paddled the boat approximately 300 feet from a dredge operating in a pond to reach the power conductors to move them away from the shoreline.\xa0 The conductors had been installed from the motor control center along the bank of the pond, in the pond, and then to the dredge.\xa0 Martin was electrocuted when he got out of the boat and attempted to pull it across the conductors.\xa0 Sharp edges along the bottom of the aluminum boat penetrated the conductor’s insulation.The accident occurred due to management’s failure to ensure that the individual power conductors supplying power to the dredge were provided with an outer jacket to protect them from mechanical damage exposing miners to an electrical hazard.\xa0 None of the persons at the mine were trained to perform electrical tasks. Martin had not received task training in the health and safety aspects of the task he was assigned, specifically working near energized conductors.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'Murray Mines Inc., a common sand and gravel operation owned and operated by Murray Mines Inc. is located in Ridgeville, Colleton County, South Carolina. \xa0The principal operating official is James Murray Jr., President. \xa0The mine normally operates two 12 hour shifts per day, five days per week. \xa0Total employment is 10 persons.At the time of the accident, sand was mined using a dredging method in a water filled pit (pond). \xa0Overburden and vegetation were stripped from the edge of the bank. \xa0A cutter head on the dredge removed the sand, and it was then pumped to the processing plant where it was washed and screened to size for use in the construction industry and at golf courses.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on November 21, 2013.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On the day of the accident, July 21, 2014, Kyle Martin (victim) arrived at the mine at approximately 8:00 a.m., his normal starting time.\xa0 His first task was to insert approximately 150 feet of pipe in the existing dredge pump line. \xa0Afterwards, he performed general maintenance work at the plant. \xa0At 12:00 p.m., Martin left the mine to pick up lunch for the mine employees.After lunch, a belt conveyor malfunctioned in the plant, blocking the screw auger with sand. \xa0The dredge stopped pumping sand.\xa0 Martin worked on the plant to resolve the problem.\xa0 At approximately 2:55 p.m., Larry Freeman, Plant Manager, spoke with Martin at the plant.\xa0Shortly thereafter, Martin left the plant and went to the dredge to check the conductors for the upcoming night shift. \xa0This is a normal daily activity to ensure that there is a sufficient amount of slack in the 480 volt power conductors to allow the dredge to advance.\xa0 Mike Datre, Dredge Operator, pushed a boat to the shore from the dredge, where it was tied, for Martin to use. \xa0Martin got in the boat and paddled it approximately 300 feet to the area where the power conductors for the dredge exited the water and were laying on the ground.\xa0 \xa0At approximately 3:30 p.m., Datre tried to call Martin to replace him on the dredge, because Datre needed to leave at 4:00 p.m.\xa0 Datre was unable to contact Martin so he called Ryan Soard, Loader Operator, using his two-way radio.\xa0 Datre told Soard he needed someone to replace him on the dredge and also told Soard he saw the boat but did not see Martin.At approximately 3:45 p.m., Ian Graham, Laborer, drove to the dredge to replace Datre and parked near Martin’s truck.\xa0 Datre told Graham that Martin had taken the boat. \xa0Graham saw the boat and walked toward it.\xa0 As Graham approached the boat, he saw Martin lying on his back, partly submerged in the water in front of the boat, which was on top of the conductors. \xa0When Graham stepped in the water, he immediately felt a light shock on his left leg and realized something was wrong. \xa0Graham then called Freeman telling him to call 911 and to shut off the power.Graham called out to Datre who was still on the dredge across the pond. \xa0At 3:58 p.m., Datre saw Graham jumping and waving his arms. \xa0Datre pulled off his back pack, left it on the dredge, jumped into the water from the left side of the dredge, and swam to shore.\xa0 He then ran to the area where the accident occurred.Graham saw Freeman leave the motor control center box where the dredge was energized.\xa0 He tested the water with his foot and did not feel any shock. \xa0Graham then pulled Martin out of the water and started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\xa0James Rogers, Safety Director, was operating a dozer clearing an area near the front of the dredge when he received a call from Freeman reporting the accident.\xa0 Rogers took the dozer to the accident scene and assisted performing CPR.\xa0 \xa0At 4:17 p.m., Emergency Medical Personnel from the Colleton County Fire-Rescue arrived.\xa0 The victim was transported by ambulance to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead at 5:25 p.m.\xa0 The cause of death was attributed to electrocution.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'MSHA was notified of the accident at 4:11 p.m. on July 21, 2014, by a telephone call from Barbra Mascarelli to the National Call Center. \xa0The National Call Center notified Patrick Sharp, District Health Specialist, and an investigation was started the same day.\xa0 An order was issued pursuant to Section 103(j) of the Mine Act. \xa0This order was later modified to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act after the arrival of an Authorized Representative at the mine site. \xa0MSHA’s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident. \xa0MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Description of the Pond Area and DredgeThe accident occurred in the pond area of the mine approximately 300 feet behind the 400 HP dredge. \xa0This mine had two motor control centers (MCC), commonly referred to as the Booster Pump Shed and the #2 Shed.\xa0 At the time of the accident, the 480 volt power for the dredge was supplied from the #2 Shed through approximately 1,500 feet of power conductors that had been laid across the ground and into the water.\xa0 The conductors were tied to floats, spaced 10 feet apart, to keep the conductors near the surface of the water. \xa0The conductors came into a main disconnect on the dredge.\xa0 The main disconnect was used for starting the main motor across the line. \xa0A soft start for the main motor was on board but it was not used.The dredge had a 30 HP Baldor fresh water pump, a 25 HP North American Electric hydraulic pump, and a 110V control transformer.\xa0 The full load current rating of fresh water pump was 36 amps. The pump was protected by 100 amp dual element time delay fuses encased in a fused disconnect.\xa0 The hydraulic pump had a full load current rating of 28.5 amps and was protected by 60 amp dual element time delay fuses encased in a fused disconnect.The victim was found near the shore in a shallow end of the pond that was approximately 9-11 inches deep.\xa0 This is the area where the dredge operators accessed the boat to travel back and forth to the dredge. \xa0The dredge operators paddled the boat approximately 300 feet to the dredge using a single paddle.WeatherThe weather on the day of the accident was cloudy with rain in the area and a temperature of approximately 80 degrees Fahrenheit with a light wind.\xa0 Weather was not considered a contributing factor to the accident.Physical FactorsThe conductors supplied 3 phase 480/277V exclusively to a suction type dredge powered from a 3 phase 500KVA pad mounted transformer with a wye-wye configuration. \xa0The transformer primary is 12470/7200V with a secondary of 480/277V and an impedance of 2.2%.\xa0 The transformer fed a motor control room which exclusively feeds the dredge.\xa0Inside the motor control room, a fused disconnect was used to connect/disconnect power to the dredge. \xa0The power could not be disconnected to the line side of the fused disconnect because it was hardwired to the secondary of the 500KVA transformer which only could be accessed by the power company. \xa0Based on persons interviewed, investigators determined that the fuses were changed on several occasions while the line side of the fused disconnect was energized.\xa0 A non-contributory citation was issued.The load side of the fused disconnect was connected to a jacketed cable of three aluminum conductors. \xa0The jacket was worn and scuffed to the point where the manufacturer’s information was no longer legible.\xa0 Management could not provide any information regarding the cable. \xa0The jacketed cable exited the motor control room and was spliced into individual conductors that powered the dredge. There was approximately 1,000 feet of the conductor per phase with an electrical rating for operation of 600V or less in wet or dry locations, including direct burial in the earth, and a maximum allowable ampacity of 500 amps at 90°C.The boat became energized to the same potential of the conductor; 480V line to line. The victim was exposed to 277V line to ground while standing in shallow water.BoatThe flat bottom, aluminum boat involved in the accident was 12 feet long and 46.5 inch wide.\xa0 This boat was the only access boat to the dredge that was provided at the mine.During the inspection of the boat, investigators noted three ribs located on the bottom of the boat that had been repaired. \xa0The right (starboard) side rib was observed with two strips of metal, one on each side of the rib, that had been placed over a strip of rubber and secured by screws into the bottom of the boat. \xa0A section of the metal strips, toward the rear of the boat, was observed separated with a thin piece of rubber lodged between the metal strip and the boat bottom. \xa0Martin was not wearing a life jacket. \xa0A newly purchased life jacket was found in his truck parked in the vicinity of the dredge.', 'TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE': ""Kyle Martin had 11 years and 8 weeks of mining experience, all at this mine. \xa0\xa0The investigators reviewed the mine operator's training records and found that Martin received annual refresher training on March 29, 2014. \xa0Martin had received task training for front-end loader operator, excavator operator, dredge operator, bulldozer operator, and mine maintenance.\xa0 However, Martin had not received task training in the health and safety aspects of the task he was assigned.\xa0 He was not provided training for the hazards associated with working near energized conductors."", 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'A root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified:Root Cause:\xa0Management failed to ensure that the individual power conductors supplying power to the dredge were provided with an outer jacket to protect them from mechanical damage thereby exposing miners to an electrical hazard.Corrective Action:\xa0Management discontinued using the dredge as a mining method. An open pit excavation system will now be used to mine the material. The dredge and the associated electrical conductors have been removed from service.Root Cause:\xa0Management failed to task train any miners, including the victim, to perform electrical tasks.Corrective Action:\xa0Management established safe operating procedures by hiring an electrical contractor trained and experienced in electrical work. All miners are trained on the new safe operating procedures.', 'CONCLUSION': 'The accident occurred due to management’s failure to ensure that the individual power conductors supplying power to the dredge were provided with an outer jacket to protect them from mechanical damage exposing miners to an electrical hazard.\xa0 None of the persons at the mine were trained to perform electrical tasks. Martin had not received task training in the health and safety aspects of the task he was assigned, specifically working near energized conductors.', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'Issued to Murray Mines Inc.Order No. 8816501\xa0- Issued on July 21, 2014, under the provisions of 103(j) of the Mine Act.An accident occurred at this operation on July 21, 2014, at approximately 1550 hrs.

Orcutt (Victim) was killed while operating a Komatsu 830E DC haul truck. The haul truck traveled through a berm at the Ramp 65 Ranch dump and descended approximately 75 feet before stopping abruptly against the opposite embankment in the bottom of the spoil “V.” The victim was not wearing his seat belt when the accident occurred, which resulted in him receiving fatal injuries.', 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'The Spring Creek Mine is a surface mine operated by the Spring Creek Coal Company and owned by Cloud Peak Energy Resources LLC. It is located near Decker, Montana. The mine extracts coal from the Anderson-Dietz seam utilizing two draglines and two electric shovels for overburden removal. The coal is loaded by a shovel, front end loaders, and a hydraulic excavator into 240 ton haul trucks. The seam averages 80 feet in thickness and the overburden varies from 65 to 185 feet thick.At the time of the accident, the mine produced 50,000 tons of coal per day and employed 282 miners. The mine operates seven days a week, using two 12-hour production shifts and two maintenance shifts per day.The principal officials for the mine at the time of the accident were:David Schwend………………………………………………………………General ManagerErik Strom……………………………………………………………….Production ManagerKean Johnson………………………………………………... Manager, Site Health & SafetyJoe Vaccari…………………………………………………………… Maintenance ManagerThe last regular safety and health inspection (E01), conducted by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), was completed on January 10, 2014. There was an ongoing inspection at the time of the accident. The mine’s non-fatal days lost (NFDL) incidence rate in calendar year 2013 was 0.00, compared to the national average of 0.96 for mines of the same type in 2013.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'Monday, June 23, 2014, was the first day shift worked following a seven day break due to shift rotation. The truck drivers arrived at their equipment at approximately 6:55 a.m. At 7:00 a.m., Stewart Orcutt, was given his job assignment by Eli Whiteman, Crew C Supervisor. Orcutt was assigned to operate the Komatsu 830E truck, company number 361, to load coal from shovel number 303 in pit 4, cut 20.The shift proceeded as normal, with coal being loaded during the shift. A lunch break occurred at approximately 1:00 p.m. Near the end of the shift, loading was stopped temporarily while the shovel was being repositioned. As the shovel was repositioning, Orcutt was the first truck in line when the loading resumed at 6:33 p.m. Shovel Operator, Cy Olson called on the mine’s FM radio (company radio) “truck 361 go dump out, you are done for the day.” Leaving the loading area, Orcutt started shouting on the company radio, which was not understandable due to the loud music playing on a citizens band (CB) radio in the truck. Orcutt would often shout religious praises and key his microphone open to the CB radio speaker for long durations.According to heavy equipment operator Ed Shannon, who was operating the dump bulldozer, Orcutt did not dump his last load on the dump. It was later determined that the load was dumped at an elevation below. Orcutt then traveled to the Ramp 74 parking area where the shift change occurs. Orcutt parked, shut his truck off, but remained in the cab of the truck. Orcutt would normally wait in the truck until the crew bus arrived, then Orcutt would exit the truck. Four other drivers came to the parking area after dumping their last load. They exited their trucks and gathered on the ground, waiting for the crew bus. Shannon drove a crew cab truck and stopped at the parking area to pick up the four drivers on the ground. Shannon noticed Orcutt in his truck and waved at him. Orcutt acknowledged and waved back. A crew bus arrived, drove by the parking area and proceeded to the #303 shovel. At this time, Orcutt restarted his truck and drove toward the #303 shovel. The crew bus passed Orcutt on its way back to the parking area. Orcutt turned around and followed the crew bus, but did not turn into the parking area. Instead, Orcutt turned onto Ramp 65, which is the road to the office/shop complex. Brandon Wilcox, the night shift truck driver for truck #361, observed Orcutt operating truck 361 and thought maybe the shop had sent Orcutt a message to come to the truck repair shop. Wilcox started walking to the lunch shack to call his boss on the company radio and to get a ride to another truck. Wilcox saw Orcutt turn onto the Ramp 65 Ranch dump at what appeared to be full speed. The truck traveled across the dump area, over the six-foot high berm, and disappeared.Wilcox ran to the lunch shack and called on the company radio “truck 361, are you ok?” Wilcox received no answer. Wilcox told Chris Boll, Truck Driver, what he had seen, but there were no other witnesses. Boll said he would drive up to the Ranch dump and look. Wilcox called on the company radio for the Shift Supervisor, Rob Marney, and asked him to go to the Ranch dump and look for Orcutt’s truck. Marney and equipment operator Randy Barney arrived at the lunch shack. They picked up Wilcox, drove to the Ranch dump, and saw a hole in the berm through which Orcutt’s truck had traveled. Boll, an emergency medical technician (EMT) and mine rescue member, parked his truck on the Ranch dump. Boll called a ‘Mayday’ over the company radio and went into the spoil “V,” where Orcutt’s truck had stopped the opposite embankment at the bottom of the spoil “V.” Wilcox and Barney were already at the scene. Orcutt was visible in the truck, but did not respond when his name was called. Wilcox held the truck door open while Boll entered and checked for a pulse. No pulse was detected. Leonard Hotchken, EMT, arrived and also checked for a pulse. It was decided to remove the victim from the truck cab onto the deck. When more help arrived, the victim was removed from the truck to a level place on the ground. The EMTs started cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and an automated emergency defibrillator (AED) was used. The AED advised ‘no shock’ and the EMTs continued CPR. The Rocky Mountain Ambulance Service from Sheridan, Wyoming arrived on scene and applied a cardiac monitor which indicated no heart activity. Terry Bullis, Big Horn County Coroner, pronounced the death at 10:35 p.m. on June 23, 2014. Orcutt was removed from the accident scene by Bullis and transported to St. Vincent’s hospital in Billings, Montana for an autopsy.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'Whiteman notified the MSHA Call Center of the accident on Monday, June 23, 2014, at 7:49 p.m. The call center notified William Reitze of District 9 at 7:58 p.m. Reitze verbally issued a 103 (j) order at 8:07 p.m. to Whiteman to secure the accident scene and assure miners’ safety at the mine. Reitze then notified Todd Jaqua, Field Office Supervisor in Gillette, Wyoming, and instructed Jaqua to dispatch an inspector to the accident scene. Jaqua dispatched Coal Mine Inspector David Maynard, who was in Sheridan, Wyoming. Maynard modified the 103(j) order to a 103(k) order upon arrival at the mine. Maynard conducted a preliminary examination of the accident scene that evening. Photographs and measurements were taken of the haul truck’s route of travel and location after the accident.Jaqua; David Hamilton, Coal Mine Inspector; and Maynard arrived on June 24, 2014, and began the formal investigation of existing physical conditions, conducted initial interviews with mine employees present at the scene, and made the initial examination of the truck. Digital photographs and relevant measurements of the scene were taken as part of the investigation. The investigation also included a review of training records, mine examination and equipment records, and maintenance records. Interviews were conducted on June 25, 26, and 27, 2014, with persons who had knowledge of the accident (see Appendix B).On June 26 and 27, 2014, data from electronic equipment removed from the truck was downloaded for investigation. This information was shared with MSHA Technical Support Mechanical Engineer, Ronald Medina. Review of the information did not reveal any issues related to the accident.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Location of Accident and Conditions:The scene of the accident was an overburden dumping location that had not been used for at least three weeks. The haul truck went through the dump berm, across a lower dump berm and came to rest approximately 75 feet below the dump. The Ranch 65 dump had a berm on the outer edge of the dump. The berm at the location of the accident extended 6 feet to the right side of a hole created by the truck going through the berm, and 5 feet and 5 inches to the left. The Komatsu 830E DC trucks on the mine site were measured to be 5 feet 4 inches high at mid-axle of the trucks and were in compliance with MSHA regulations.Approximately 0.35 inches of rain had fallen earlier in the day, ending at 7:00 a.m. The dump area was dry at the time of the accident. The temperature was 710 Fahrenheit, with a 3.5 to 4.6 miles-per-hour wind from the South. The road to the 65 Ranch dump was intermittently watered.The accident investigation team was not able to determine what caused the truck operated by Orcutt to travel across the dump, through the berm, and descend into the spoil “V” cut.General Machine InformationThe haul truck was a Komatsu 830E and the product identification number was A30818. The truck had direct current (DC) electric drive, and was a rigid frame rear dump truck that was designated by the company as unit number 361. The truck was equipped with a Cummins QSK 60, 16 cylinder, diesel engine and a General Electric (GE) Statex III, electric drive system. The electric drive system had a three-position control for the forward, reverse, and neutral positions. Two GE type 787 electric wheel motors, one at each rear wheel, powered by an engine driven alternator, propelled the truck. The foot operated service brake or the electric retarder were utilized to slow the truck as needed.Summary of Equipment Related Physical Factors:No braking or steering system defects were found.\nWhen the haul truck stopped suddenly at the bottom of the spoil “V” cut, an arc chute for the RP2 contactor dislodged and hit the door of the electrical enclosure. This caused the Statex III Drive System central processing unit (CPU) to record an RP2 contactor fault. The RP2 contactor is one of several contactors that are energized to establish the electric retarding circuit. No other braking, steering, retarder, or electric drive system faults were logged during the time of the accident.\nThe RP2 contactor fault triggered the Statex III Drive System CPU to store 51 frames of data, 40 before the fault code event and 10 after, plus the event itself. In terms of time this was 8.51 seconds prior to the event and 2.08 seconds afterward. This was the standard window of data that is saved as a result of such events and was a total of 10.59 seconds. The data within the 10.59 second time frame was analyzed.\nPutting the 10.59 seconds on a timeline, data collection began at time 0. Near the 1.8 second mark, the Statex data indicated the wheel speed suddenly increased, indicating the point where the truck crested the edge of the dump and started down the steep slope. Near the 6 second mark, the wheel speed data indicated the truck suddenly stopped, apparently when the truck struck the bottom of the “V” cut. The RP2 contactor fault occurred at 8.51 seconds. The Statex data indicated that the service brake and park brake were not applied at any time during the 10.59 second period of data collected. In addition, the Statex data indicated that the retarder was not applied as the truck approached the berm and traveled through it. After the truck went over the edge, the Statex data indicated intermittent retarder applications mostly at values of less than 10%, with 0% representing no retarder and 100% representing maximum retarder. These intermittent retarder commands occurred while the truck was bouncing down the slope and did not cause any effective slowing of the truck based on the wheel speed data collected.\nA map based on global positioning system (GPS) data points from the Modular Mining Systems Dispatch/Mine Care system was generated that displayed the truck’s position after the shift ended. The GPS data showed that the empty truck went to the parking area when the shift ended. Next, the truck left the parking area and traveled on a haul road back toward the dump point that had been used during the shift. Thereafter, the truck made a U-turn, traveled to the 65 Ranch dump, went through the berm, and down the steep slope.\nExperience and training recordsOrcutt was an experienced truck driver, having 5 years and 50 weeks of experience, all at the Spring Creek Mine. Orcutt received task training on a Komatsu 830E haul truck on July 9, 2008. Orcutt received annual refresher training on January 16, 2014.The Cloud Peak Health and Safety Standards handbook, June 3, 2013 version, page 31, 7.1 states, “The driver and all passengers must wear their seat belts, where fitted, at all times.” The seat belt in Orcutt’s truck was not engaged when examined at the accident scene. The seat belt assembly was still intact after the accident and the seat belt functioned when tested.ToxicologyToxicology of the victim’s blood was conducted post-mortem. The results were:Diphenhydramine: 0.19 MG/L quantitated in the blood and detected in the urine;\nCyclobenzaprine: 0.07 MG/L quantitated in the blood and detected in the urine;\nOxymorphone: 0.05 MG/L quantitated in the blood at this concentration;\nCaffeine: detected in the blood and urine;\nIbuprofen: detected in blood;\nAcetaminophen: detected in blood;\nGabapentin: detected in blood;\nMetoprolol: detected in blood.\nThe Toxicology results did not draw a conclusion with regard to the substances found in the victim’s blood.Mine ExaminationsThe work area where the accident occurred was examined prior to the accident. No hazards were noted in the mine’s examination records.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'An analysis was conducted to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctible through management controls. These root causes, if corrected could have prevented the accident or mitigated the outcome. The following root cause was identified:Root Cause:\xa0The mine operator failed to ensure seat belts were used where there is a danger of overturning mobile equipment. The victim did not wear his seat belt.Corrective Action:\xa0The mine operator modified its new miner and contractor training plans to emphasize the importance of the use of seat belts. The plan further emphasized the potential disciplinary actions for not wearing a seat belt.Additionally, the mine operator established a Safety Interaction Program that involves performing spot checks on a continual basis to determine if the miners are wearing their seat belts. This program also involves having conversations with employees about the use of seat belts and the requirement for wearing seat belts. The mine operator trained all miners and crews on the training plan revision and new safety interaction program, including the mandatory requirements of seat belt usage at the mine at all times.', 'CONCLUSION': 'The fatal accident occurred when the haul truck, operated by the victim, traveled through a berm, descended approximately 75 feet, and stopped abruptly against the opposite embankment in the bottom of a spoil “V.” The cause of the truck traveling through the berm was not determined. The victim was not wearing his seat belt when the accident occurred which resulted in him receiving fatal injuries.', 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': '103(j) Order No. 8477220 was issued to ensure the safety of all miners during and after any recovery actions taken for the affected area. It prohibited all activity at the Ramp 65 Ranch Dump and 500 feet to either side of its entrance, until MSHA determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations. The order was modified to a section 103(k) order at 9:28 p.m. on June 23, 2014.\n104(a) Citation No. 8476775 was issued for a violation of 30 CFR § 77.403-1(g). Komatsu 830E end dump truck c/n 361 was involved in a fatal accident at approximately 7:35 p.m., on 6/23/2014 at the Ramp 65 Ranch dump. The driver of the truck was not wearing a seat belt. Mobile equipment that is required to be equipped with ROPS by § 77.403(a) must have a seat belt that is worn by the equipment operator. This is also a requirement of 30 CFR § 77.1710(i).\n'}","monday, june 23, 2014, was the first day shift worked following a seven day break due to shift rotation. the truck drivers arrived at their equipment at approximately 6:55 a.m. at 7:00 a.m., stewart orcutt, was given his job assignment by eli whiteman, crew c supervisor. orcutt was assigned to operate the komatsu 830e truck, company number 361, to load coal from shovel number 303 in pit 4, cut 20.the shift proceeded as normal, with coal being loaded during the shift. a lunch break occurred at approximately 1:00 p.m. near the end of the shift, loading was stopped temporarily while the shovel was being repositioned. as the shovel was repositioning, orcutt was the first truck in line when the loading resumed at 6:33 p.m. shovel operator, cy olson called on the mine’s fm radio (company radio) “truck 361 go dump out, you are done for the day.” leaving the loading area, orcutt started shouting on the company radio, which was not understandable due to the loud music playing on a citizens band (cb) radio in the truck. orcutt would often shout religious praises and key his microphone open to the cb radio speaker for long durations.according to heavy equipment operator ed shannon, who was operating the dump bulldozer, orcutt did not dump his last load on the dump. it was later determined that the load was dumped at an elevation below. orcutt then traveled to the ramp 74 parking area where the shift change occurs. orcutt parked, shut his truck off, but remained in the cab of the truck. orcutt would normally wait in the truck until the crew bus arrived, then orcutt would exit the truck. four other drivers came to the parking area after dumping their last load. they exited their trucks and gathered on the ground, waiting for the crew bus. shannon drove a crew cab truck and stopped at the parking area to pick up the four drivers on the ground. shannon noticed orcutt in his truck and waved at him. orcutt acknowledged and waved back. a crew bus arrived, drove by the parking area and proceeded to the #303 shovel. at this time, orcutt restarted his truck and drove toward the #303 shovel. the crew bus passed orcutt on its way back to the parking area. orcutt turned around and followed the crew bus, but did not turn into the parking area. instead, orcutt turned onto ramp 65, which is the road to the office/shop complex. brandon wilcox, the night shift truck driver for truck #361, observed orcutt operating truck 361 and thought maybe the shop had sent orcutt a message to come to the truck repair shop. wilcox started walking to the lunch shack to call his boss on the company radio and to get a ride to another truck. wilcox saw orcutt turn onto the ramp 65 ranch dump at what appeared to be full speed. the truck traveled across the dump area, over the six-foot high berm, and disappeared.wilcox ran to the lunch shack and called on the company radio “truck 361, are you ok?” wilcox received no answer. wilcox told chris boll, truck driver, what he had seen, but there were no other witnesses. boll said he would drive up to the ranch dump and look. wilcox called on the company radio for the shift supervisor, rob marney, and asked him to go to the ranch dump and look for orcutt’s truck. marney and equipment operator randy barney arrived at the lunch shack. they picked up wilcox, drove to the ranch dump, and saw a hole in the berm through which orcutt’s truck had traveled. boll, an emergency medical technician (emt) and mine rescue member, parked his truck on the ranch dump. boll called a ‘mayday’ over the company radio and went into the spoil “v,” where orcutt’s truck had stopped the opposite embankment at the bottom of the spoil “v.” wilcox and barney were already at the scene. orcutt was visible in the truck, but did not respond when his name was called. wilcox held the truck door open while boll entered and checked for a pulse. no pulse was detected. leonard hotchken, emt, arrived and also checked for a pulse. it was decided to remove the victim from the truck cab onto the deck. when more help arrived, the victim was removed from the truck to a level place on the ground. the emts started cardio pulmonary resuscitation (cpr) and an automated emergency defibrillator (aed) was used. the aed advised ‘no shock’ and the emts continued cpr. the rocky mountain ambulance service from sheridan, wyoming arrived on scene and applied a cardiac monitor which indicated no heart activity. terry bullis, big horn county coroner, pronounced the death at 10:35 p.m. on june 23, 2014. orcutt was removed from the accident scene by bullis and transported to st. vincent’s hospital in billings, montana for an autopsy."

accident occurred in the crusher plant on the TEL SMITH cone crusher trailer during the relining of the cone crusher.Equipment involved in the accident\nThe 790 ELC John Deere excavator involved in the accident uses a series of pedals and levers in the cab to control the machine’s movement and the operation of the excavator arm and bucket.\xa0 This unit is equipped with a hydraulic lock-out lever to the left of the operator’s seat that disengages the hydraulics so that the unit and implements will not move.\xa0\xa0The lever has two positions. \xa0When the handle is in a 90 degree vertical position, the hydraulics are isolated and the machine controls are not operable. \xa0When the lever is pushed forward, from a vertical position down to approximately 45 degrees, the machine will move and the arm and bucket will operate.\xa0 While in the 45 degree (operation) position, the lever partially blocks the exit from the excavator.\xa0 The lock-out lever and hydraulic controls were tested and functioned properly. \xa0Weather\xa0\nThe weather on the day of the accident was mostly clear and sunny.\xa0 The temperature ranged between 49 degrees in the morning and a high of approximately 79 degrees Fahrenheit in mid-afternoon. \xa0Weather was not considered to be a contributing factor in the accident.Training and Experience\xa0\nMichael Schmidt had thirteen years and one week of experience as a Plant Maintenance Mechanic, all at this mine.\xa0 An in-depth review of the mine operator's training records was conducted.\xa0 The training records for Schmidt were reviewed and found to be in compliance with MSHA training requirements."", 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'Investigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified the following root causes:Root Cause: The excavator operator was unable to effectively maintain control of the excavator while exiting the cab of the unit, resulting in the excavator bucket striking the victim.Corrective Action: The operator retrained miners to shut down the unit before exiting the cab.Root Cause:\xa0 The victim was not wearing any type of fall protection to prevent him from falling from the top of the cone crusher.Corrective Action:\xa0 Miners were retrained in the proper use of fall protection', 'CONCLUSION': 'Management failed to ensure that the hydraulic system, on the excavator being used to lift heavy components during repair tasks, was deactivated.\xa0 This allowed the boom to swing, knocking another miner off of the crusher.\xa0 Management also failed to ensure that miners were wearing fall protection devices when exposed to the danger of falling.\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0'}","michael schmidt, mechanic, arrived at the hualapai pit at 6:00 a.m. pst on tuesday, may 13, 2014.  schmidt, mark shaffer, laborer, and donnie scroggins, lead operator, set out to replace the bowls in the mine’s cone crusher.  the team was using a john deere 790 elc excavator to lift and move the heavy parts.  scroggins was operating the excavator, and shaffer was helping schmidt to replace the worn out parts in the cone crusher.  the job proceeded without any reported problems until the accident, which took place at approximately 11:30 a.m.
    
immediately before the accident, scroggins used the bucket of the excavator to lower the top bowl into the body of the crusher.  shaffer was below the crusher putting the oil plug into the bottom of the cone crusher and schmidt was above making sure the bowl was placed properly.  the bowl was in place and had been disconnected from the excavator bucket.  schmidt gave scroggins directions, but he did not understand them.  scroggins said that he disengaged the hydraulics using the lock-out lever, got up, and began to exit the cab of the excavator.  as he exited the cab, he inadvertently hit the swing arm lever, causing the hydraulics to reengage and the bucket to swing toward schmidt. schmidt was standing with one foot on the crusher drive belt guard and the other on the cone.  as the bucket swung, it struck schmidt in the side, causing him to fall forward off of the crusher.  he fell approximately 11 feet to the ground, landing on his head and shoulder.  shaffer and scroggins saw schmidt fall and immediately went to his aid.  an ambulance was summoned and schmidt was transported to the hospital.schmidt suffered severe injuries, including a broken collar bone, a broken neck, a broken back, two broken legs, and broken ribs.  after spending several months in the hospital, he was moved to a rehabilitation facility.  he was released from the rehabilitation facility in mid-april 2015, but had to return, because a foot wound was not healing properly.  schmidt went into acute respiratory distress, and was transported to the hospital where he died on may 26, 2015."

Ayers did not see Reynolds in the truck, which was still running with the headlights on. \xa0Ayers went to investigate by walking around the truck and then shined his flashlight into the diversion ditch where he saw Reynolds face down in the water.\xa0Ayers immediately called the “911” emergency phone number at approximately 5:25 a.m., and spoke with the emergency operator until the ambulance arrived.\xa0 Shortly after the ambulance arrived at the site, a Crime Scene Investigator with the Kanawha County Sheriff’s Department also arrived to conduct an investigation because the accident was determined to be an unwitnessed death.\xa0The victim’s body was recovered from the diversion ditch by the East Bank Volunteer Fire Department and subsequently taken to the West Virginia State Medical Examiner’s office in Charleston, West Virginia for autopsy.\xa0 The Chief Medical Examiner concluded the cause of death to be asphyxia due to drowning. \xa0The toxicology report also showed “Marked alcohol intoxication causing work site impairment; judged contributory to fatal accident scenario.”\xa0 The victim had a blood alcohol (Ethanol) content of 0.27% at the time he died.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On April 18, 2014 at 5:53 a.m., the accident was reported to MSHA’s National Call Center by Frank Linville. \xa0At 6:13 a.m., Roy Baker, District 4 Health Supervisor, received notification from the call center that a night shift security guard had been found dead on the property by an employee who had reported for work on the day shift.\xa0 Baker called the facility and at 6:30 a.m., issued a verbal 103(j) Order to Frank Linville in order to prevent the destruction of evidence and to preserve the accident scene. \xa0Martin Carver, Supervisory Mine Safety and Health Inspector from the Mt. Carbon Field Office, and Andrew Sedlock, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Accident Investigator from the Mt. Hope Field Office, were notified of the accident and dispatched to the site.\xa0 Upon arrival at the facility, the 103(j) Order was reduced to writing and subsequently modified to a 103(k) Order to insure the safety of all persons during the investigation.\xa0The accident was investigated in conjunction with the West Virginia Office of Miners’ Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST), the Kanawha County Sheriff’s Department, the operator of the facility, the contract operator, and the employees of the operator and contractor.A list of the persons participating in the investigation is shown in Appendix A.', 'DISCUSSION': 'The diversion ditch where the victim was found was constructed around the perimeter of the coal stockpile area and was approximately 10 feet wide at its base, near the water level. \xa0The top of the berm where the victim’s pickup truck was located was approximately 6 to 7 feet above the bottom of the ditch, and the sides of the ditch sloped at less than a vertical angle into the bottom of the ditch.\xa0 The ditch had been recently cleaned out and there was 4 to 12 inches of sediment and water in the bottom of the ditch.\xa0 The diversion ditch was physically located between the coal stockpile area of the facility and the Kanawha River.The victim’s truck, a 2009 Ford Ranger extended cab pickup, had traveled approximately 15 feet up and onto a road berm (approximately 16 inches in height), that had been constructed around the diversion ditch.\xa0 The wheels of the truck had straddled the berm and become stuck with the left rear tire just above ground level on the inside of the berm.\xa0 The truck was found still in gear with the engine running, the headlights on, and the driver’s side door open directly above the diversion ditch.\xa0 The ground slope from the top of the road berm down to the bottom of the diversion ditch was vegetated and less than vertical in grade.\xa0 The victim was working alone at the time of the accident.\xa0 There were no witnesses. \xa0Based on observations during the investigation, it appears that the victim exited his truck from the driver’s side and slid or fell down the slope into the water at the bottom of the diversion ditch where he was found face down.Following the recovery of the victim’s body, the truck involved was moved by a wrecker to a safe location where it was inspected and tested for any defects.\xa0 A brake service function test was conducted while the vehicle was in gear at an engine speed of 2000 revolutions per minute (rpm).\xa0 Steering components on the pickup were also inspected for defects.\xa0 No mechanical deficiencies with the brakes or steering functions were identified by the inspection.\xa0Items inside the cab of the pickup truck were examined during the investigation by the Sheriff’s office criminal investigator.\xa0 These included miscellaneous clothing, a hand held radio, a flashlight, several personal items, and an empty whiskey bottle (approximately 4/5 quart). \xa0\xa0Reynolds was an employee of Allied Security. \xa0He had worked at this location for 12 years as a security guard/supervisor.\xa0 Reynolds had received Hazard Training for this mine site.\xa0', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'A root cause analysis was conducted to identify the basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 Listed below is the cause that was identified by the analysis and the corrective action which was implemented to prevent a recurrence of the accident.Root Cause:\xa0 A substance abuse screening program which is conducted to check for alcohol or drug abuse on a regular basis, but unannounced, was not in place for security personnel employed at this operation.\xa0 The victim’s blood alcohol content was found to be 0.27% at the time of his death.Corrective Action:\xa0 The contractor has put into effect a Drug and Substance Abuse Policy for its employees, including the contract employees utilized at this facility.', 'CONCLUSION': 'A contract security guard drowned in a diversion ditch containing 4 to 12 inches of sediment and water.\xa0 The investigators concluded that the victim exited the driver’s side of the truck he was operating and slipped or fell into the diversion ditch where he drowned.\xa0 Alcohol intoxication causing work site impairment was also identified as a contributing factor.\xa0 The employer of the security guard did not have in place a substance abuse screening program for its employees at this facility.\n\xa0Approved By:\xa0_____________________________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ________________\nDavid S.

Simms, District Manager\n\xa0OVERVIEWAt approximately 1:07 p.m. on October 5, 2013, Robert E. Smith, a 47-year-old general laborer, was fatally injured at the White County Coal LLC, Pattiki Mine. The victim was traveling out of the mine at the end of his shift. The victim was driving a battery-powered, two-man personnel carrier. Evidence indicates that a diesel-powered vehicle began to push the victim’s personnel carrier, which caused the personnel carrier to overturn on top of Smith. The accident occurred because mine management did not have adequate programs, policies, and procedures in place to ensure safe travel of self-propelled vehicles on outby travelways of the mine.GENERAL INFORMATIONThe Pattiki Mine, I.D. No. 11-03058, is operated by White County Coal, LLC and is located in White County near Carmi, Illinois. The mine began production in the Herrin No. 6 coal seam in March of 2002. The mine has 312 employees, with 275 underground workers.Coal is produced on two shifts daily, five days a week, with an average daily production of 10,703 tons. The mine has eight mechanized mining units (MMUs), which utilize shuttle cars to transport coal from the working face to the belt tail. Conveyor belts transport the coal from the working section to the surface.The last regular safety and health inspection (E01) of the mine was completed by MSHA on September 26, 2013. A regular safety and health inspection was not in progress at the time of the accident. The Non-Fatal Days Lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for the mine operator in 2012 was 3.82, compared to a National NFDL rate of 3.24.The principal officers at this mine at the time of the accident were:Johnny Garrett .......... General Manager\nJoshua Bell .......... Safety Director\nRandy Taylor .......... SuperintendentDESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENTOn Saturday, October 5, 2013, at approximately 1:07 p.m., Smith, (victim) was driving the No. 7 personnel carrier out of the mine at the end of his shift. His shift started at 3:00 a.m. He had been to the No. 2 unit to assist on a power move and to build brattices (stoppings). Smith and Steven Brown, Roof Bolter, left the section at approximately 12:37 p.m. after finishing their work for the day. While traveling out of the mine on the No. 7 battery-powered personnel carrier, they were asked by Chris Buchanan, Mine Manager, to take the Company No. 7359 “Blue Jake” diesel-powered personnel carrier out of the mine. Brown exited the No. 7 personnel carrier at crosscut #23 on the 4th 48 travelway. Smith proceeded in front, driving the battery-powered carrier, and Brown followed him driving the diesel-powered carrier. While traveling out of the mine, at approximately crosscut No. 6 on the 2nd 48 travelway, Brown noticed Smith’s vehicle swerve, hit the left side rib, and then overturn. Smith was trapped under the No. 7 personnel carrier. Brown tried to move the No. 7 carrier to free Smith from under the vehicle. Brown was unable to move the vehicle and radioed for help.Josh Knight, Mine Examiner, heard the call for help and traveled from the mechanic’s shack to the scene of the accident, a distance of approximately 1,500 feet. Knight and Brown tried to lift the overturned personnel carrier to free Smith, but they were unable to move it. They located a timber and used it to pry the personnel carrier upward to free Smith. After Smith was removed from under the personnel carrier, Knight evaluated Smith and did not detect any vital signs. Knight began to perform cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on Smith. Knight continued CPR until the arrival of Biff Mosby, Mechanic. Smith was transported out of the mine by Knight, while Mosby continued CPR until arrival on the surface.The White County Ambulance Service arrived at 1:38 p.m. Upon arrival on the surface, emergency medical service personnel from the ambulance service relieved Mosby. The White County Coroner arrived a short time later. Smith was pronounced dead at 1:59 p.m.INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENTThe MSHA call center was notified of the accident at 1:50 p.m. on October 5, 2013, by Joshua Bell, Safety Director. A citation, which did not contribute to the accident, was issued for a violation of 30 CFR § 50.10, because MSHA was not notified immediately, at once, without delay, and within 15 minutes. The call center notified Mary Jo Bishop, Assistant District Manager/Enforcement, at the District 8 Office in Vincennes, Indiana. MSHA personnel were immediately dispatched to the mine. A section 103(j) order was issued to ensure the safety of persons at the mine until an investigation could be conducted.The accident investigation was conducted in cooperation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Mines and Minerals. Photographs and measurements of the accident scene were taken and interviews with four miners and management officials were conducted by the investigation team on the day of the accident. Operational checks of the equipment were performed and additional photographs were taken at the accident site on October 7, 2013. An additional interview was conducted with a miner on October 15, 2013, at the Pattiki Mine office. The on-site portion of the investigation was completed on October 21, 2013. A list of those persons who participated in the investigation is shown in Appendix A of this report.DISCUSSION', 'Accident Scene': 'The accident occurred on the 2nd 48 travelway, which is the secondary escapeway and a main haulage road for the mine. The specific location of the accident was between crosscuts No. 5 and No. 6 of the travelway. The 2nd 48 travelway at the accident scene was in good condition, with a four-foot elevation difference between crosscut No. 12 and crosscut No. 5. The victim was traveling outby and uphill at the time of the accident. No mine-bottom irregularities were observed in the area. The entry was 21-feet wide, with windrows of coal and rock on each side of the travel way. Loose material from rib sloughage was present in the area where the accident occurred.\nDuring interviews, Brown stated that he saw the No. 7 personnel carrier swerve, hit the left rib (facing outby), and overturn. Brown stated that the left side of the carrier rose and caused the carrier to overturn in a clockwise direction from his position.Evidence at the scene of the accident, however, does not support Brown’s account of the carrier swerving and hitting the rib. There were no visible tire marks or disruption of the soft wind row of raw coal and rock along the left rib to indicate that the carrier hit or ran up on the rib (Appendix B).Additionally, there was a fresh skid mark approximately 14.5 feet in length, that indicated that one tire of the No. 7 personnel carrier skidded in a straight line, with respect to the entry, while the wheels were turned to the left (Appendix B). The tires on this personnel carrier have a unique and pronounced alternating tread. A tire will not leave this type of pattern, unless it was skidding.'}",

Pierce, District Manager\n', 'OVERVIEW': ""Joe Donald Trevathan, Dozer Operator, age 68, died on July 10, 2013, while operating a dozer. The dozer was pushing overburden in a direction parallel to a pond located 130 feet away. The dozer veered hard to the right and then traveled in a straight line, with the blade raised, toward the pond. The dozer reached the side of the pond and slid sideways to the right approximately 20 feet into the pond.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) conducted an investigation regarding chargeability of the accident as a mine-related fatality. The accident investigators determined the dozer functioned properly and could not determine what caused the dozer to veer off the path of travel and travel in a straight line for approximately 130 feet. Trevathan did not lower the dozer blade or attempt to make an emergency stop before the dozer entered the water.Information was forwarded to MSHA's Fatality Review Committee (Committee). Based on the results of MSHA's investigation and a review of the available medical documentation, the Committee determined on September 30, 2014, that Trevathan’s death should be charged to the mining industry.The autopsy report and death certificate indicated Trevathan died of a cardiac dysrhythmia due to hypertensive heart disease with submersion in water."", 'GENERAL INFORMATION': 'Troy Plant, a construction sand and gravel operation owned and operated by Ford Construction Company, is located near Hwy 21 in Troy, Obion County, Tennessee. The principal operating official is John H. Ford, President. The mine normally operates one 10-hour shift per day, five days per week. Total employment is 8 persons.After removal of the overburden, the sand and gravel is loaded into haul trucks, transported to the plant where it is screened, sized and washed. The material is stockpiled and the finished products are sold for use in the construction industry.Prior to the accident, MSHA completed the last regular inspection at this mine on May 17, 2013.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On the day of the accident, July 10, 2013, Joe Trevathan (victim) started to work at 6:00 a.m. Trevathan went to his dozer, located in the sand pit, and started stripping by pushing overburden material to create a new pit. At about the same time, Steve Alexander, Equipment Operator, arrived and drove to the gravel pit to get a motor grader. Alexander operated the motor grader for about 45 minutes. He then went to the sand pit stripping area where Trevathan was working. For about five minutes they discussed the work to be done that day and went to the dozers to strip overburden material.Alexander noticed Trevathan stopped the dozer about 9:30 a.m. After taking a break, Trevathan continued stripping until about 10:45 a.m. when he traveled to get the fuel truck. Trevathan returned with the fuel truck and fueled his and Alexander’s dozers. He then drove the fuel truck to refuel the truck’s tanks which typically takes about 1½ hours. Trevathan returned and about 12:30 p.m., took a 20 minute lunch break with Alexander. After lunch, he continued stripping with the dozer.At approximately 2:00 p.m., Alexander moved his dozer to the spoil bank to level it up. He made four passes with his dozer but could not see Trevathan because he was not facing in the direction where Trevathan was working. When Alexander backed up, he did not see Trevathan’s dozer. He promptly turned the dozer around and started to travel to the area Trevathan was working. As Alexander approached the area, he saw Trevathan’s water cooler floating in the pond. He continued to travel towards Trevathan’s work area and noticed a set of dozer tracks leading to the water’s edge. Alexander exited his dozer and walked toward the water but could not see Trevathan or the dozer.At 2:43 p.m., Alexander phoned Jessie Lewis, Leadman, to contact Brian Bartz, Foreman, to tell him to come to the stripping site because it appeared Trevathan had driven his dozer into the water. Bartz arrived at the site and called 911 for Emergency Medical Assistance (EMS).EMS arrived at 3:08 p.m. and requested a boat and divers to assist in the search for Trevathan. The divers searched the area until dark but could not locate the dozer. Two water pumps were set up on the north end of the pond to pump the water level down.The next morning, July 11, 2013, the water level in the pond had decreased about three feet but the dozer still was not visible. Search efforts resumed and at 1:24 p.m., the divers located Trevathan. He was removed from the water and transported to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. The cause of death was attributed to cardiac dysrhythmia due to hypertensive heart disease with submersion in water.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'On July 10, 2013, MSHA was notified of the accident at 3:08 p.m. by a phone call from Vicki Greer, Scale House Clerk, to Jim Croft, Supervisory Mine Safety and Health Inspector. Croft notified Doniece Schlick, Assistant District Manager. Greer also called MSHA’s National Call Center. An investigation was started the same day. To ensure the safety of all persons, an order was issued pursuant to Section 103(j) of the Mine Act. This order was later modified to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act when the first Authorized Representative arrived at the mine.MSHA’s accident team traveled to the mine, made a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed the employees, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident. MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees.', 'DISCUSSION': ""Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred at the sand pit stripping area adjacent to the pond.DozerThe dozer involved in the accident is a Caterpillar model D8N track-type tractor that was manufactured in 1994. It is not equipped with a ripper. It is powered by a Caterpillar 3406C six cylinder turbocharged and aftercooled diesel engine with a net 285 horsepower rating. The engine is connected to an automatic transmission with 3 forward and 3 reverse gears.The dozer was recovered from the pond approximately seven weeks after the accident. The blade and the axle shafts were removed to transport the dozer from the accident site to the Ford Construction Company shop for inspection. The axle shafts were reinstalled to perform the brake test described below.The accident investigators examined the dozer for any defects. The dozer was washed to remove the mud. No significant impact or rollover damage was observed. Rust was present in numerous places. Water was present inside the fuel tank, hydraulic oil tank, and engine. Mud was present under the operator’s compartment floor panels that were removed to inspect steering and braking linkages. The dozer’s engine could not be started for the investigation.Service Brake TestSince the dozer could not be operated, the functional test provided in the dozer's operation and maintenance manual could not be performed. The holding ability of the brakes was tested by pulling on the dozer with a rubber-tired front end loader and measuring the holding force of the brakes. Note that with the engine not running, the brake hydraulic release pressure was not available; therefore, the brakes were fully applied. Without hydraulic pressure the transmission was also in neutral.When pulled, the dozer tracks slid on the dirt covered pavement. No slippage of the brakes occurred at a force of approximately 42,400 lbs. At the dozer's test weight of approximately 61,600 lbs. (no blade), the brakes would be capable of holding on at least a 43° grade. At the estimated full machine weight (with the blade), the brakes are estimated to hold on at least a 35° grade. Since the dozer slid on the pavement rather than the brakes slipping, this test did not determine the full capability of the brakes. However, the test confirmed that a substantial braking force could be developed by the brakes.Brake InspectionThe parking brake control cable and the service brake linkage were inspected. No damage or loose connections were observed. Dimensional checks of the parking brake control cable and service brake linkage did not show any significant deviations from Caterpillar specifications. The parking brake lever was found in the released position at the time of the inspection. The parking brake cable was difficult to manually operate however it could be moved across its expected range of motion. The difficulty in moving the parking brake lever was attributed to the effects of the dozer being submerged in the water after the accident. The service brake pedal and linkages could be moved manually without difficulty.Governor and Decelerator ControlsThe dozer was equipped with a hand-operated governor control lever that was connected to the engine governor through linkages. This lever allowed the operator to set the engine's speed. Pulling the lever toward the operator increased the engine speed and pushing it forward decreased the engine speed. By pushing the lever to its furthest position from the operator, the operator was also able to move the governor to shut off fuel and stop the engine. A decelerator pedal was located next to the service brake pedal. The decelerator pedal was connected to the governor control lever linkage and was used to reduce engine speed when making directional changes.Governor and Decelerator Inspection and TestingThe linkages for the governor control lever and decelerator pedal were inspected. Both the governor control lever and decelerator pedal could be moved manually without difficulty. No damage or loose connections was observed with the governor control lever. The decelerator pedal's connection to its shaft was worn and loose. When pushed down, the decelerator pedal did rotate the shaft to the governor. No functional test of the governor control lever or decelerator pedal could be performed since the engine could not be started.Steering, Transmission, and Blade Systems InspectionFunctional tests of the steering, transmission, and blade systems could not be performed since the engine could not be started. The steering and blade control levers could be moved manually without difficulty. The steering control would return to neutral when released and the blade control would return to the hold position when released The directional control selector and the transmission gear selector, both connected to cables, could not be moved by hand. This was attributed to the effects of the dozer being submerged in the water after the accident. In discussions with Caterpillar, it appeared the directional control selector was in the forward position and the transmission gear selector was either in 1st or 2nd gear.The accident investigators determined no equipment related defects or factors contributed to the accident."", 'TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE': 'Joe D. Trevathan had 23 years of mining experience. The accident investigators reviewed Trevathan’s training records. They were found to be up-to-date and in compliance with MSHA requirements.', 'CONCLUSION': ""The accident investigators determined the dozer functioned properly and could not determine what caused the dozer to veer hard to the right off the path of travel and then travel in a straight line for approximately 130 feet toward the pond. Trevathan did not lower the dozer blade or attempt to make an emergency stop before the dozer entered the water.Based on the results of MSHA's investigation and a review of the available medical documentation, the Committee determined on September 30, 2014, that Trevathan’s death should be charged to the mining industry.The autopsy report and death certificate indicated Trevathan died of a cardiac dysrhythmia due to hypertensive heart disease with submersion in water."", 'ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS': 'Order Number 8730026\xa0- issued on July 10, 2013, under the provisions of Section 103(j) of the Mine Act:An accident occurred at this operation on July 10, 2013 at approximately 3:00 p.m. As rescue and recovery work is necessary, this order is being issued under section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, to assure the safety of all persons at this operation. This order is also being issued to prevent the destruction of any evidence which would assist in the investigating the cause or causes of the accident. It prohibits all activity at the area of the impoundment, the D6 Caterpillar bulldozer, the D8 Caterpillar bulldozer and the area approximately 255 feet south (marked by pink flags, where the operator of the D6 Caterpillar dozer first noticed that the D8N Caterpillar dozer was missing). An area road where there are tracks of the D8N Caterpillar bulldozer, until MSHA has determined that it is safe to resume normal operations in the affective area. This order applies to all persons engaged in the rescue and recovery operation and any other persons on site. This order was initially issued orally to the mine operator at 3:13 p.m. and now has been reduced to writing.The order was terminated on September 23, 2013, after the accident investigation was completed.'}","on the day of the accident, july 10, 2013, joe trevathan (victim) started to work at 6:00 a.m. trevathan went to his dozer, located in the sand pit, and started stripping by pushing overburden material to create a new pit. at about the same time, steve alexander, equipment operator, arrived and drove to the gravel pit to get a motor grader. alexander operated the motor grader for about 45 minutes. he then went to the sand pit stripping area where trevathan was working. for about five minutes they discussed the work to be done that day and went to the dozers to strip overburden material.alexander noticed trevathan stopped the dozer about 9:30 a.m. after taking a break, trevathan continued stripping until about 10:45 a.m. when he traveled to get the fuel truck. trevathan returned with the fuel truck and fueled his and alexander’s dozers. he then drove the fuel truck to refuel the truck’s tanks which typically takes about 1½ hours. trevathan returned and about 12:30 p.m., took a 20 minute lunch break with alexander. after lunch, he continued stripping with the dozer.at approximately 2:00 p.m., alexander moved his dozer to the spoil bank to level it up. he made four passes with his dozer but could not see trevathan because he was not facing in the direction where trevathan was working. when alexander backed up, he did not see trevathan’s dozer. he promptly turned the dozer around and started to travel to the area trevathan was working. as alexander approached the area, he saw trevathan’s water cooler floating in the pond. he continued to travel towards trevathan’s work area and noticed a set of dozer tracks leading to the water’s edge. alexander exited his dozer and walked toward the water but could not see trevathan or the dozer.at 2:43 p.m., alexander phoned jessie lewis, leadman, to contact brian bartz, foreman, to tell him to come to the stripping site because it appeared trevathan had driven his dozer into the water. bartz arrived at the site and called 911 for emergency medical assistance (ems).ems arrived at 3:08 p.m. and requested a boat and divers to assist in the search for trevathan. the divers searched the area until dark but could not locate the dozer. two water pumps were set up on the north end of the pond to pump the water level down.the next morning, july 11, 2013, the water level in the pond had decreased about three feet but the dozer still was not visible. search efforts resumed and at 1:24 p.m., the divers located trevathan. he was removed from the water and transported to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. the cause of death was attributed to cardiac dysrhythmia due to hypertensive heart disease with submersion in water."

Senior Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerA regular safety and health inspection by MSHA was in progress at the time of the accident.\xa0 The previous inspection was completed on March 30, 2010. \xa0The Non Fatal Days Lost (NFDL) incidence rate for the mine in 2009 was 3.68, compared to a national NFDL incidence rate of 4.16 for underground mines.', 'DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT': 'On Wednesday, April 28, 2010, at approximately 3:00 p.m., prior to entering the mine, the second shift crew for the No. 6 Working Section met with the rest of the second shift miners in a group safety meeting held by mine management.\xa0 After the meeting, the second shift crew entered the mine and traveled to the section located in the 2nd Southeast Panel to relieve the day shift crew. \xa0Brian Perdue, Section Foreman, held another safety meeting with the crew at the dinner shack prior to the miners starting production.\xa0 Production began at approximately 3:45 p.m. \xa0Travis and Carter assumed their normal duties of operating the right side continuous mining machine in entries 0 through 3 Left Crosscut.\xa0 This is a split air working section with a mechanized mining unit set up on both the left side and right side of the working section.\xa0 Each side has one continuous mining machine, one roof bolting machine and two shuttle cars.\xa0 Travis and Carter had cut 1 Left Crosscut when the 36 B Belt pulled apart, interrupting production at approximately 4:29 p.m. \xa0\xa0Personnel from the section, including Carter, were sent to help with the belt repair. \xa0After the belt was repaired, production resumed at approximately 6:22 p.m. \xa0Travis and Carter mined a 20 foot cut in the No. 0 Entry, opened 3 Left Crosscut and mined the face of No. 3 Entry approximately 38 feet in depth.Travis and Carter were in the process of moving to the next proposed cut in No. 2 Left Crosscut when draw rock (approximately 6 to 12 inches thick) fell in the unbolted face of the No. 3 Entry.\xa0 The fall was reported by Jeremy Teague and James Gibson, Shuttle Car Operators on the right side. \xa0Travis informed both Teague and Gibson that he was going to clean up the rock to help the roof bolting machine operators. \xa0Travis and Carter cleaned up the right side of the No. 3 Entry and had set up to complete loading rock on the left side when the accident occurred at approximately 10:00 p.m.\xa0 Meanwhile, Gibson left the feeder and stopped two crosscuts outby the face in No. 3 Entry to allow Teague to enter the entry with his shuttle car from the crosscut between the No. 2 and No. 3 Entries. \xa0Gibson stated that he was looking at the face when he saw the methane monitor on the mining machine and the two cap lights of the miner operator and helper go “black.” \xa0Teague proceeded into the No. 3 Entry, where he encountered dust from an apparent roof fall. \xa0He got out of his shuttle car and observed the roof fall on the continuous mining machine cable. \xa0Teague ran to the No. 3 Left Crosscut, in hope that Travis and Carter had escaped to safety. \xa0After not seeing Travis or Carter, Teague called for Perdue to come to the No. 3 Entry.\xa0 Gibson observed Teague running and calling for Perdue over the radio. \xa0Gibson, along with R.J. Oliver and Quentin White, the Right Side Roof Bolting Machine Operators, ran toward the face of the No. 3 Entry, where they observed Teague pulling rock from the fall by hand. \xa0White notified the other section crew members of the accident (See Drawing of Accident Site, Page 1). \xa0\xa0\xa0David Brown, Mine Foreman, had just arrived on the section, when he was notified of the accident.\xa0 Brown instructed Jason Bratcher, Section Mechanic, to call outside and have someone notify all appropriate authorities and company officials. \xa0Bratcher was then assigned to monitor the mine phone and all communication systems on the section to relay accurate information and to facilitate the rescuers’ needs.', 'INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT': 'At 10:28 p.m. Abel DeLeon, MSHA District 10 Field Office Supervisor was notified by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) Hotline operator of an accident at the Dotiki Mine.\xa0 The caller indicated there were two people entrapped by a roof fall on the No. 6 Section.\xa0 A 103(j) Order was issued over the phone.\xa0 MSHA District 10 personnel, including Carl E. Boone II, District Manager, Ted Smith, Assistant District Manager and Troy Davis, Staff Assistant/Accident Coordinator were alerted to the mine emergency.\xa0 At 11:20 p.m. William Barnwell and Archie Coburn, District 10 Coal Mine Inspectors, were dispatched to the mine to initiate the accident investigation and assist as needed with rescue operations.On Friday April 30, 2010, Barnwell and Coburn, along with David Winebarger, District 10 Roof Control Specialist, Mike Gauna, from MSHA’s Technical Support Roof Control Division, plus Greg Goins and Tim Fugate, Kentucky Office of Mine Safety and Licensing (OMSL) Accident Investigators, traveled to the accident scene to take measurements and photographs.\xa0 Interviews were held at the Dotiki III Training Center on Saturday, May 1; Tuesday, May 4; and Wednesday, May 5. \xa0\xa0A total of 31 miners and mine management officials were interviewed.', 'DISCUSSION': 'Initial Accident Response:Winebarger and James Hackney, District 10 Roof Control Supervisor, were dispatched to assist with ongoing rescue operations.\xa0 Boone reported to the command center, located at the Dotiki IV training room, to assist in directing the rescue operation.\xa0 Secure communication from the No. 6 Section had already been established.\xa0 Alliance management and OMSL personnel were also present in the command center. \xa0MSHA, OMSL, and company personnel participated in monitoring and direction of the rescue operation.\xa0 Robert Gray, District 10 Family Liaison, was dispatched to the Family Center, located at the Nebo Baptist Church in Nebo, KY.\xa0 The mine operator had Melody Wilson and Eric Anderson, company employees, as their family liaisons at the Family Center.\xa0 The entrances to the mine and Family Center were secured by KY State Police and Hopkins County Sheriff personnel.\xa0Upon arrival at the Dotiki Mine, Smith, Hackney and Winebarger traveled to the accident scene to assess the rescue efforts and assist with measures taken to protect the miners working to reach Travis and Carter.\xa0 The efforts were hampered by the orientation of the loose rock from the roof fall and other hazards of the roof outby the fall.\xa0 Additional roof support was installed and specialized equipment was constructed and utilized to remove loose rock as remotely as possible (See Appendix B, Exhibit 1).\xa0 The second shift crew of No. 6 Section departed at about 5:30 a.m. Thursday, April 29, 2010, while other rescuers continued efforts to reach the miners.\xa0 As rock was removed, Michael Carter was located and recovered at 2:05 p.m. and taken to the surface.\xa0 At 2:24 p.m. Justin Travis was located.\xa0 Travis was recovered at 5:25 p.m. and taken to the surface.Dotiki Mine Layout:Most of the mine personnel access the mine via the Dotiki IV Portal, located approximately 2 miles north of Nebo, in Hopkins County, Kentucky.\xa0 The portal is a 685 feet shaft situated off Balls Hill Road (State Route 502) at 37.4049° north latitude and 87.6332° west longitude.\xa0 There are 10 MMUs in the Dotiki Mine.\xa0 Coal is extracted from the West Kentucky No. 9 Coal Seam (also known as the Springfield Coal Seam) and from the West Kentucky No. 11 Coal Seam (also known as the Herrin Coal Seam).\xa0\xa0 Six MMUs (Section Nos. 1, 3 and 6) operate in the No. 9 Seam and four MMUs (Sections No.s 2 and 4) operate in the No. 11 Seam.No. 6 Section:The entries are numbered from right-to-left, with the far right entry designated “No. 0” and the far left entry “No. 8.”\xa0 Mining is conducted with two radio remote control continuous mining machines operating independently on two separate air splits. \xa0The right side machine is used to mine the No. 0 to No. 3 Entries, and typically the crosscut between the No. 3 and No. 4 Entries.\xa0 The mining machine on the left side of the section is used to mine the No. 4 to No. 8 Entries.\xa0 Two coal transporter cars, a dual boom roof bolting machine, and a scoop are assigned to each mining machine.\xa0 The accident involved the right side continuous mining machine and occurred in the No. 3 Entry at the projected position for Crosscut 26 (no crosscut had been turned).The No. 6 Section was mining the 2nd SE Panel off 2nd NE Sub-Mains.\xa0 The 2nd SE Panel is oriented approximately S70°E and is being developed in the southeastern direction. \xa0The section is nine entries wide with the entries on 70 foot centers and crosscuts on 70 foot centers.\xa0 Overall development width of the panel is approximately 580 feet.\xa0 Overburden across the face area inby the feeder ranges from 875 to 900 feet.\xa0 Overburden was gradually decreasing to the southeast.\xa0 The No. 9 Coal Seam in the area dips to the northeast (N33°E) at 3.4% grade.\xa0 No under mining or over mining with older workings exists in the vicinity of the No. 6 Section.The No. 6 Section (2nd SE Panel) is bordered to the northeast by the recently completed nine-entry 3rd SE Panel and bordered to the southwest by the projected ten-entry 1st SE Panel.\xa0 At the time of the accident, the 2nd SE panel had completed approximately 1,400 feet of the projected 2,280 feet of development.\xa0 Approximately 13 crosscuts remained to be mined and the panel was to terminate at the mined out old No. 3 Section (now sealed).\xa0 The previous 3rd SE panel had completed its entire 2,800 feet projected distance and had terminated at the sealed old No. 3 Section. (See Appendix B, Exhibit 2)\xa0 After the fatal roof fall accident, a decision was made by the mine operator to relocate the No. 6 Section outby the roof fall area.Physical Description of the Accident Site:The fatal accident site is located in the No. 3 Entry, approximately 83 feet inby Spad (survey station) 78566 and approximately 223 feet inby the No. 6 Section belt feeder (set in No. 4 Entry, Crosscut 22).\xa0 The outby edge of the roof fall along the right side of the No. 3 Entry was 2 feet inby the intersection of Crosscut 25.\xa0 The outby edge of the roof fall along the left side of the No. 3 Entry was 18 feet inby the intersection of Crosscut 25.\xa0 The outby edge of the roof fall was oriented diagonally across the entry at approximately N70°E.\xa0 Prior to the accident, Crosscut 25 had been completed by mining into the No. 4 Entry (See Appendix B, Exhibit 3, Location of Miners and Equipment at Time of Accident).\xa0 The No. 3 Entry at the accident site had been mined approximately 19.8 feet wide.\xa0 The mining height was approximately 60 inches (See Drawing of Accident Site, Page 1).The maximum visible portion of the roof fall cavity extended approximately 10 feet above the coal.\xa0 The roof fall extended rib-to-rib across the entry.\xa0 During the rescue activity, roof fall rubble had been removed to where approximately 24 feet of cavity length was exposed, as measured along the entry center line.\xa0 The fall rubble obstructed viewing the roof fall cavity walls beyond the exposed 24 feet length of the fall.\xa0 The roof fall cavity was approximately 10 feet maximum height, 19.8 feet width, and up to 76 feet in length, assuming the fall extended the full length of the reported cut depth (See Appendix B, Exhibit 4).At the time of the accident, the continuous mining machine was positioned to clean draw rock from the left side of the cut and awaiting the next shuttle car.\xa0 The head of the continuous mining machine was positioned inby the last row of roof bolts.\xa0 The mining machine operator and helper were last observed by Gibson to be positioned and working under the third row of roof bolts outby the unbolted cut, approximately 8 feet from last row of roof bolts.\xa0 This location referenced by Gibson was after his (Gibson’s) shuttle car had been loaded and he was en route to the feeder.\xa0 The two miners were recovered approximately 7 feet and 16 feet, respectively, outby their last observed work positions.Geology:At the accident site, the immediate mine floor consisted of claystone.\xa0 The two nearest core holes (2,150 feet northwest and 5,400 feet northeast of the accident site) indicate that the claystone is at least 2.5 feet thick.\xa0 In the western portion of the roof fall, the coal seam is approximately 5.0 feet thick with roughly 0.5 foot of claystone floor removed.\xa0 At the outby perimeter of the roof fall, the immediate black shale roof had not been mined.\xa0 The strata exposed in the fall cavity indicates that the immediate roof consisted of approximately 1.3 feet of black shale, (common for the No. 9 Seam, locally referred to as “black slate”) overlain by 3.4 feet of gray shale containing pyrite nodules, and then overlain by at least 5.3 feet of gray shale and sandy shale with slickensides (also referred to as “slips”) evident in the overlying gray shale and sandy shale (See Appendix B, Exhibit 5).\xa0 The slickensides were randomly oriented, discontinuous, and curvilinear (represented by a curved line).\xa0 They appear to be features formed from the deposition, then later compaction, of the shale/sandy shale sequence.\xa0 The gray shale/sandy shale beds exposed in the fall rubble range from 1 foot, to 2.5 feet thick and were intersected by the randomly oriented slickensides.\xa0 At least six different slickenside orientations at various dip angles were noted in the roof fall cavity walls.\xa0 The general trend of the slickensides was S25°E to S50°E at dip angle from near vertical to flat lying.\xa0 The slickensides, in the portion of the roof fall cavity that could be investigated, did not project into or through the black shale above the coal seam. \xa0The slickensides cut through and dismembered the gray shale and sandy shale beds in the horizon above the coal seam (area above the black shale), for a distance of 1.3 feet, up to 10 feet. \xa0The slickenside features were noted to the top of the roof fall cavity.\xa0 No water was evident either in the roof fall rubble or in the fall cavity walls.Roof Control Plan Requirements for No. 6 Section:The remote controlled continuous mining machine cycle uses a 40-foot deep cut plan, where the furthest penetration inby the last full row of permanent roof support shall be no greater than 40 feet.\xa0 Reportedly, the operation typically mines a 38-foot deep cut depth.\xa0 A minimum of two cuts are required to mine the crosscuts with the 70-foot crosscut centers on No. 6 Section.\xa0 Pillar recovery is not conducted. \xa0Mining width is a maximum of 20 feet, and is normally between 19 to 20 feet.\xa0 Primary roof support consisted of 3/4-inch diameter, grade 40, 5-foot fully-grouted, deformed bar roof bolts installed with 2 x 8 x 24-inch wood header boards and 6 x 6-inch bearing plates. Roof bolt spacing distance is 4.5 to 5 feet between bolts within the row, with a minimum of four bolts per row.\xa0 Spacing between the outside bolts and the pillar rib is a maximum 3.5 feet.\xa0 The rows of bolts are installed on a 4-foot, row-to-row spacing.\xa0 The mine’s roof control plan required additional roof support in areas with overburden greater than 800 feet, consisting of a minimum 8-foot cable bolts, installed in a “star pattern” (See Appendix B, Exhibit 6) in all intersections.\xa0 Primary support in the No. 5 Entry supply road consisted of 5-foot, fully-grouted roof bolts and 8-foot cable bolts installed in every other row of bolts on an “in and out pattern” (See Appendix B, Exhibit 7).\xa0Drilling of roof test holes was not required in the mining area where the roof fall accident occurred. \xa0Test holes were required for areas where adverse roof conditions were being encountered, or in areas that had been idled for more than 14 calendar days. The mine operator was installing cable bolts as supplemental roof support.\xa0 The eight foot cable bolt holes were considered a test hole, because the holes were three feet longer than the primary roof bolts required by the approved plan. \xa0Six cable bolts were installed in the section intersections according to the approved roof control plan.Roof Conditions and Roof Support on No. 6 Section:A traverse of the No. 6 Section face areas revealed five slickenside features visible in the black shale immediate roof, one in each of the No. 0, No. 2, No. 4, No. 5, and No. 7 Entries.\xa0 No slickenside features were noted in the No. 3 Entry accident site outby the roof fall.\xa0 The slickenside features in the No. 2, No. 4, No. 5, and No. 7 Entries did not resemble the features noted in the roof fall cavity.\xa0 They were oriented at N42°E to N78°E and consistently dipped to the southeast.\xa0 They were tight, singular features, and oriented diagonally across the entry. \xa0As a result, there was not a potential for roof failure to propagate along the entry.\xa0 The slickenside in No. 0 Entry was a singular feature, oriented S45°E, an orientation that could propagate roof failure along the entry. \xa0The mine operator reportedly reduced the No. 0 Entry cut depth to approximately 20 feet and the slickenside feature was supported and controlled with supplemental 8-foot cable bolts installed on both sides of the feature.\xa0 Miners also stated during the accident investigation interviews that the cut in No. 0 Entry was reduced to approximately 20 feet.\xa0 The slickenside feature in the No. 0 Entry had been supported with supplemental 8-foot cable bolts installed on both sides of the feature.\xa0 Reportedly, supplemental roof support had not been installed in the No. 3 Entry roof fall area.\xa0After the roof fall and during the rescue/recovery operation, the roof in the No. 3 Entry outby the roof fall deteriorated gradually.\xa0 A fracture propagated along the right rib from the fall cavity for roughly 25 feet.\xa0 Roof buckling was evident for approximately 70 feet outby the fall cavity.\xa0 Roof control was maintained in the No. 3 entry outby the fall by installing 0.6-inch-diameter x 8-foot-long cable bolts with 8-inch x 8-inch bearing plates at the vicinity of the fall cavity.\xa0 Wood posts, wood cribs and Heintzmann 100- Ton Alternative Crib Support (ACS) were installed along the No. 3 Entry and roof trusses were installed across the entry outby, to the four-way intersection at Spad 78566.The mine site roof fall map indicated that the four closest roof falls were situated 1,100 to 1,430 feet from the accident site.\xa0 Two of these roof falls were southeastward 1,125 to 1,430 feet away, located in the old No. 3 Section (now sealed) and two roof falls were southwestward 1,200 to 1,380 feet away in the 1st NW Sub-Mains.\xa0 The mine operator sealed old No. 3 Section, 920 feet to the southeast of the accident site because of wet roof conditions and roof falls associated with these conditions.\xa0 No wet roof conditions existed in the No. 6 Section face area where the roof fall occurred.\xa0 No wet roof conditions were reported in the nine previously mined No. 6 Section panels surrounding the 2nd NE Sub-Mains. \xa0Additionally, no reportable roof falls had occurred in the No. 6 Section mining area since late summer 2008.\xa0 The mine roof fall map indicated that because of the addition of the intersection supplemental support plan (installed in a “star pattern” at depths greater than 800 feet); there was a decrease in reportable roof falls.\xa0 Since the intersection support plan has been implemented in this portion of the reserve, one roof fall has been reported (See Appendix B, Exhibit 2).The No. 6 Section pillars and floor showed no evidence of unusual pillar or floor stress.\xa0 MSHA calculations employing the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Analysis of Retreat Mining Pillar Stability (ARMPS) software, using a 5.5-ft. mining height, 900 ft. of overburden, and ARMPS default physical properties, resulted in a development mining ARMPS pillar stability factor of 1.77, which meets NIOSH guidelines for stable pillars.\xa0The No. 6 Section crosscuts showed a tendency for horizontal stress induced roof fractures, which are typical for No. 9 Seam roof when oriented near to north-south.\xa0 The operator was controlling the roof in the crosscuts by installing the additional 8-foot cable bolts in conjunction with the 5-foot fully-grouted bolts.\xa0 The regional maximum principle horizontal stress is oriented at N80°E.\xa0 The NIOSH Analysis of Horizontal Stress in Mining (AHSM) program indicates that the crosscuts have a moderate to difficult orientation for horizontal stress fractures.\xa0 The entries have a moderate to good orientation for horizontal stress fractures.\xa0 This explains the general lack of horizontal stress fractures in the entries, compared to the crosscuts.Summary:Hidden slickensides (slips) were present in the face of the No. 3 Entry of No. 6 Section.\nThe unsupported area above the fresh cut, mined in the No. 3 Entry face, allowed the overlying roof that was weakened by slickensides (“slips”) to break the layers of strata.\nA massive section of roof, up to 76 feet long, 19 feet wide, and a maximum 10 feet thick, fell on the area that included the continuous mining machine and its operators.\nThe Approved Roof Control Plan was being complied with at the time of the accident.\nTraining:Joe Fritz, Mine Safety and Health Training Specialist, of MSHA Educational and Field Services (EFS), conducted an examination of the miners’ training records. \xa0All training was current and met MSHA Part 48(a) requirements for underground training.', 'ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS': 'An analysis was conducted to identify the most basic cause of the accident that was correctable through reasonable management controls.\xa0 During the analysis, a root cause was identified that, if eliminated, may have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.The root cause listed below was identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions proposed by mine management to prevent a recurrence of the accident:Root Cause:\xa0 The mine operator failed to detect the presence of slickensides, which dismembered the overlying shale and sandy shale beds and caused the roof to fall.Corrective Action:\xa0 In areas where the overburden is greater than 750 feet, mine management proposed and will install a robust support system, in the vicinity of the last row of bolts, to prevent a roof fall that initiates in the unbolted cut from extending outby and exceeding the capacity of the roof support system.\xa0 This corrective measure and other roof support measures designed to bolster the existing support system were approved by MSHA in a supplement to the mine operator’s Approved Roof Control Plan, including:•\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Four 10-foot cable bolts will be installed between the last two rows of bolts to supplement the primary roof support system.•\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Entry width reduced to 19 feet.•\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Cut depth measured from last 10-foot cable bolt.•\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Newly exposed roof will be bolted within 3 hours of coal removal.', 'CONCLUSION': 'The two fatalities occurred when the mine encountered an anomaly of multiple hidden intersecting slickensides, commonly referred to as “slips,” which were not detected by the mine operator.\xa0 The most likely fall propagation mode was roof failure in the unbolted cut that had the momentum to pull down the roof in the bolted portion of the entry where the miners were working.\xa0 The bolted portion of the entry also had non-visible or hidden slickensides in the overlying bolted strata that weakened the overlying rock beds and allowed the bolted roof to be pulled down where the miners were working.\xa0 The absence of any sign of “slips” in the immediate roof gave no warning for the need to install supplemental or additional support.\xa0Approved By:\xa0_____________________\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 _________________Carl E.

While the victim was waiting near the bottom of the Eagle 1 Slope, the brakeman car along with a 14 ton locomotive and loaded rail car was being pulled up the slope to the surface. At about 420 feet from the \xa0collar of the slope, the rope attached to the brakeman car broke and the trip ran away. The victim was struck by the run away trip resulting in fatal injuries.\n\xa0\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n\xa0\nEagle Mine is an underground coal mine located on Fields Creek Road, six miles off Route 1, near Winifrede, Kanawha County, West Virginia. Production began at the mine in 1969. It was operated separately by Carbon Fuel and U S Steel Mining Company until 1985. Wayne Processing Inc. re-opened the mine on February 1, 1999, and Newtown Energy, Inc. began operating the mine on March 2, 2000. The mine is accessed through a slope located at Fields Creek Road and a shaft located on Spice Lick off Joes Creek, 4.5 miles off Route 3 near Comfort, Boone County, West Virginia. The mine is ventilated with one blowing fan. The mine liberates approximately 1,000,000 cubic feet of methane every 24 hours.\nCoal is being extracted from the Eagle Coal Seam.\n\xa0\nThe mine employs approximately 200 persons, and is not represented by a labor organization. An average of 4,000 tons of coal is produced daily from three sections that utilize continuous mining machines. Coal is transported from the working sections to the surface via a series of belt conveyors. The mine produces coal two shifts per day, five days per week. The track is used to transport \xa0miners, supplies, materials, and equipment, into and out of the mine. The principal officers for the mine at the time of the accident were:\n\xa0\nRobert E Ellis.......................................................................................................President\nRichard Asebes ................................................................................... Manager of Mines\nJamie Dotson............................................................................................ Superintendent\nBobbie Harper.............................................................................General Mine Foreman\nJames Loving ............................................................................................ Safety Director\n\xa0\nThe last regular Safety and Health Inspection (E01) was completed on September 30, 2009. The non-fatal days lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for 2009 for the mine was 7.31, compared to a National NFDL rate of 4.26 for a mine of this type.\n': '\xa0', '\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT\n\xa0\nOn Monday, October 26, 2009, at approximately 11:30 p.m., Charles Dixon (victim) and Daniel Ewing, both trackmen, started their shift at the Eagle Slope Portal. They were assigned to go to the No. 2 Section and remove track, two crosscuts in length, and load the rails on a rail car. The rail car that was needed was located on the surface at the supply yard. Dixon rode the brakeman car to the bottom of the slope, retrieved a 14 ton locomotive that was located near the bottom of the slope and coupled it to the brakeman car. Ewing waited on the surface. When the locomotive arrived on the surface, Dave Morgan, third shift hoist operator, assisted Ewing in coupling the rail car to the locomotive. The brakeman car, the locomotive, and the rail car were sent to the bottom of the slope, and Ewing rode the brakeman car as it was being sent down.\n\xa0\nEwing met Dixon at the bottom of the slope and they uncoupled the locomotive and rail car and took them to the No. 2 Section. After the track was removed and the rails and other components of the track were loaded on the rail car, they were directed to take the rails to the surface where they could be stored.\n\xa0\nEwing and Dixon arrived at the bottom of the slope at approximately 6:45 a.m., and met with Morgan, who had conducted a pre-shift examination of the slope belt and was returning to the surface. The locomotive and rail car were to be taken to the surface, the rail car set in the supply yard, and the locomotive sent back to the bottom of the slope where it could be taken to be charged. Ewing and Morgan entered the brakeman car, Ewing in the front seat and Morgan in the second, and started up the slope. Dixon waited at the bottom of the slope near the hoist control station to take the locomotive to the charging station when it \xa0was sent back down. When the brakeman car travelled to a location approximately 420 feet from the surface, the rope broke and the trip ran away back down the slope. Morgan yelled to Ewing to push the button to engage the brakes. Ewing pushed the button and they both jumped from the car.\n\xa0\nRichard Lambert, day shift hoist operator, and Mike Tabor, day shift beltman, were in the hoist control room waiting on their shift to start. Lambert saw a warning light on the control panel. He discovered that the slack rope switch had been engaged. They then discovered that the hoist rope had broken. Lambert used the mine phone and Tabor used the tracking phone to call the bottom of the slope; however, they did not receive a response. Lambert then notified mine management at the Spice Lick Portal. Tabor started down the slope and met Morgan coming out of the slope and assisted him to the surface.\n\xa0\nTabor went to the bottom of the slope and discovered extensive damage to the track, ventilation door, cables, brakeman car, locomotive, and rail car. The brakeman car, locomotive, and rail car de-railed and the rail car stopped\n': '\xa0', '\napproximately 260 feet inby where the brakeman car normally stops. He found Ewing in a confused state looking for Dixon where the trip had de-railed. Dixon was located approximately 30 feet inby the locomotive, lying unresponsive on \xa0the mine floor next to the left rib. Tabor and Ewing then went to the waiting area on the 1 East track.\n\xa0\nAfter learning of the accident, Rick Asebes, mine manager, Bobby Harper, mine foreman, and Larry Boggs, maintenance superintendent, drove from Splice Lick Portal to the Eagle Portal and went down the slope to the accident scene. Mike Herndon, foreman, and Sammy Gore, compliance coordinator, traveled to the accident scene. Wilson Goad, third shift foreman, and Josh Hager and Chris Holstein, general laborers, came to the accident scene as well.\n\xa0\nGoad, who is an EMT, and others at the scene checked Dixon and no vital signs were detected. First aid was administered to Ewing and he was transported to the Spice Lick Portal by Gore and Herndon, via rail mounted personnel carrier. Once Ewing was on the surface, Gore and Herndon went back to the accident scene and Dixon was transported to the surface by Asebes, Gore, and Herndon.\n\xa0\nDixon was transported by the Whitesville Fire and Rescue Ambulance to the Whitesville Fire Station in Whitesville, West Virginia, and the State Medical Examiners Office transported him to the State Examiners office in South Charleston, West Virginia. Ewing and Morgan were transported by ambulance to Charleston Area Medical Center, General Division, in Charleston, West Virginia, where they were treated and released.\n\xa0\nINVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT\n\xa0\nMSHA was notified of the accident through the National Call Center at 7:00 a.m., on October 27, 2009. A 103(j) Order was issued orally to the mine operator at \xa07:10 a.m., to protect the safety of all persons at the mine. MSHA accident investigators were dispatched to the mine and the 103(j) Order was reduced to writing and then modified to a 103(k) Order. The investigation was conducted in cooperation with the West Virginia Office of Miners’ Health, Safety, and Training (WVMHST). A list of those persons participating in the investigation can be found in Appendix A of this report. Personnel from MSHA Technical Support and MSHA Educational Field Services participated in the investigation.\n\xa0\nDISCUSSION\n\xa0\nUHOIST OPERATION AND WARNING DEVICES\nThe hoist could be operated in either manual or automatic mode. At the time of the accident, the hoist was being operated in automatic mode. In automatic mode, miners could push buttons at the top and bottom of the slope to bring the\n': '\xa0\nhoist to the loading locations. Then, miners could push a button to raise or lower the hoist.\n\xa0\nVisible and audible warning devices were located on the surface near the slope, near the bottom of the slope, and near the designated waiting area underground at the 1 East track. A sign was posted on a crib near the designated waiting area that stated “Mantrip waiting area. Stay clear of track while waiting for hoist car”. \xa0The operator’s policy was that when these devices were activated, miners \xa0at the bottom of the slope were to leave the danger zone and go to the designated waiting area away from the slope. According to Newtown management, this policy was orally communicated to miners during safety discussions. However, it was determined during interviews that not all miners were aware of the policy and the policy was not always complied with. The underground loading location, where the button was located to raise or lower the hoist, was at least 380 feet outby the underground designated waiting area. Miners normally positioned themselves in a dangerous location at the bottom of the slope when men and material were being hoisted into and out of the mine.\n\xa0\nThe visible warning devices were yellow-flashing lights, one on the surface and two underground. Two lights were located at the brakeman car designated parking positions where miners loaded, one on the surface, and one underground. The third light was located underground at the designated waiting area. When the hoist start button was actuated to lower the hoist, the lights flashed continuously until the trip arrived at its designated parking position and actuated the bottom approach limit switch which deenergized the hoist motor. The lights also flashed when the hoist was moving in the “up” direction.\n\xa0\nAudible warning devices were buzzer type and located at two locations at the bottom of the slope, the brakeman car designated parking position and at the designated waiting area. When the hoist button was actuated, the warning device alarmed for 10 seconds.\n\xa0\nThe audible and visible warning devices located at the designated parking position underground were destroyed in the accident resulting in the system being inoperative. During interviews a statement was made that the visible warning devices functioned properly. Those interviewed could not remember if the audible device was working.\n\xa0\nSLOPE AND HOIST EQUIPMENT\n\xa0\nSlope\nThe slope entry is divided into two compartments by a vertical cinder block wall. The track is on the left side facing inby, and is used to hoist personnel and material into and out of the mine. A conveyor belt is on the right side and is used to convey coal out of the mine. The track entry side of the slope was an alternate escapeway and was a mechanical escape facility. The zero distance point for the hoisting system was located at the sheave wheel approximately 36 feet from the outside of the hoist house. The slope collar is located approximately 154 feet from the sheave wheel. The slope dips at a 16º angle and is approximately 1,500 feet long to a track curve. The track curve is part of the slope and turns left when facing inby. The curve is a slight turn that is approximately 20º. After the center of the curve, the slope extends approximately 20 feet to the bottom of the slope. The 1 East track is located approximately 390 feet from the turn. When the accident scene was examined, all of the wreckage was located between the turn in the slope and the 1-East track.\n\xa0\nAn examination of the environmental conditions of the slope was conducted on October 30, 2009. Starting from the zero point in the hoisting system (sheave wheel), the following conditions were noted.\n\xa0\n154 feet - Slope Collar\n530 feet - Water between rails\n619-635 feet - Wet between rails\n740 feet - Water dripping from roof of slope\n1180-1227 feet - Water dripping from roof\n1230-1380 feet - Not very wet\n1380-1410 feet - Water between rails\n1530 feet - Dry (appears to have been rock dusted)\n1750 feet - Curve in track (Stopping Point)\n\xa0\nHoist\nThe hoist was manufactured by Ottumwa Iron Works. It was refurbished in 1999 and upgraded in 2001. The hoist is equipped with overspeed, overwind, automatic stop controls, and two independent braking systems. The braking systems include the drive motor brake and jaw-type brake on the hoist drum.\nThe jaw brake is gravity applied and electrically released. Overspeed is monitored by a Lilly Controller which is mechanically connected to the hoist drum and upon activation removes power to the hoist and sets the brakes in the system. The hoist speed is also programmed into the programmable logic control (PLC) system. The top hoist speed was approximately 400 feet per minute \xa0\xa0(fpm). The system also has current overload protection. Overwind was also provided by the Lilly controller, and overwind back-up (redundancy) was provided by magnetic switches (top and bottom) activated by the brakeman car. The hoist was also equipped with a slack rope switch located at the window of the hoist house and a switch located at the top of the drum to detect any piling \xa0up of the rope on the drum. If these switches were actuated, the drive motor was deenergized and the brakes are set.\n\xa0\nWire rope\nThe hoist wire rope, installed on June 22, 2007, was identified as a 1-1/8 inch diameter 6 X 30 STY G RL XXIP FC SL wire rope.\n\xa0\nThe breaking strength for this rope was listed as 70.1 tons in the Wire Rope Users Manual, 4th\xa0Edition. Company personnel provided a certificate from the Wire Rope Corporation of America indicating that the rope had an actual breaking strength of 78.1 tons. The minimum design factor required under Title 30 CFR Part 75.1431(a) was determined to be 5.4 based on a slope length of 1,600 feet.\nThe weight of load being hoisted at the time of the accident, met the design requirements for the rope installed.\nThe rope was terminated with an open type zinc poured socket. After traveling over a sheave wheel located 36 feet from the outside of the hoist house, the load end of the termination was connected to a brakeman car. The 60 inch (outside diameter) sheave wheel rotated on a lubricated shaft that was 58 inches long. The sheave wheel could travel freely along the entire length of the shaft, as the rope was spooled onto and off of the hoist drum.\n\xa0\n\xa0\nConveyance\nThe conveyance consisted of the brakeman car, locomotive, and loaded rail car. The battery powered locomotive was used to couple the loaded rail car to the brakeman car.\nThe brakeman car was a Sanford Day Model BSD brakeman car. It is equipped with six electromagnetic brakes that can be applied manually or automatically. When activated, the electromagnets are energized and clamp down onto both metal rails due to magnetic attraction. This provides a braking force that can stop the brakeman car and the rest of the conveyance up to a certain load. Visual evidence (slight wear markings on the tops of the rails) was present on the rail surfaces, indicating that the brakeman car’s electromagnetic brakes had been applied approximately 500 feet from the slope collar. These marks continued intermittently for several hundred feet down the slope.\nThe weight of the conveyance exceeded the braking capacity of the brakeman car. The conveyance weight, which included the weight of the brakeman car, was 32.17 tons. Assuming the best possible conditions, including dry rails, the maximum possible load that the brakeman car could have stopped was 26.95 tons. Under the actual conditions present, the maximum load should not have exceeded 18.3 tons. This assumes a 20% safety factor, wet rail conditions, and an optimal brake reaction time of 0.43 seconds.\nA visual examination was conducted on the brakeman car after it was removed from the mine and transported to the surface. The rollback switch functioned as designed. The overspeed centrifugal switches were also examined. The housings for both switches had been destroyed in the accident and the contacts for the switches were also destroyed or missing. One of the switches rotated freely and the other appeared to have a bent shaft which prevented it from turning completely. The “V” belts connecting the switches to the wheels were in place. A visual examination was conducted on the six wear bars located at each brake. All six wear bars showed evidence of wear. The control panel was extensively damaged in the accident. No determination could be made concerning the position of the “Up/Down” switch at the time of the accident.\nDuring normal operation, when the switch is in the Down Position, rollback is disabled so that the car can be lowered. However, the car could be hoisted in either direction with the switch in the Down direction.\n\xa0\nWIRE ROPE FAILURE\nThe wire rope failed at a point approximately 575 feet from the load attachment on the brakeman car as the trip was being pulled to the surface. The failure point occurred as the rope traveled over the sheave wheel located outside the hoist house. This was indicated by the number of broken wires found under the sheave wheel, the presence of core fibers, and small wire segments embedded in the lubricant on the sheave wheel, and the length of rope remaining on the hoist drum. Broken wires were gathered from the grease on the sheave and on the ground just below the sheave wheel. They included center strand pieces along with individual wires.\nThe hoist house and the wire rope remaining on the hoist drum were examined on the day of the accident. Three sections of the rope: the end of the 4th\xa0layer which extends to the failed end of the rope, a section approximately 14 wraps into the 3rd\xa0layer, and a section 19 wraps into the 3rd\xa0layer, were dry and showed no evidence of lubrication. The failed end was wet (from rain water) and no evidence of lubrication was present on this section of rope.\n\nThe outer wires of each strand of the failed end were worn. Many of the wires were no longer round due to wear, abrasion, and corrosion.\n\xa0\nThe car side of the failure was examined in the mine the day following the accident. Approximately 575 feet of the hoist rope extended from the load termination at the brakeman car up the slope. The failed end had traveled uncontrolled down the slope after it broke. There was dirt and debris on the outer portion of the rope and there did not appear to be any lubricant present in the vicinity of the car side failure. The wires at the car side of the failure were examined and showed evidence of wear and pitting corrosion.\nMatco Services Inc. (Matco) was contracted to provide a failure examination of the hoist rope. A laboratory evaluation was conducted December 1, 2009, on the hoist side portion of the failure and the additional wires (14 pieces) recovered from the mine. The car side of the portion of the failure was photographed at Matco. A detailed examination of the wire failures on the car side portion of the rope failure was not conducted. No laboratory examination was conducted because the end of this portion of rope connected to the car traveled uncontrolled down the slope, leaving behind a considerable number of broken wires along the slope. The Matco report summary describes that the wire rope failure was due to significant wire corrosion and wear.\n\xa0\nNONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING (NDT) & VISUAL EXAMINATIONS\nCode of Federal Regulations Title 30 requires wire ropes to be visually examined once every fourteen calendar days. If a visible condition results in a reduction of rope strength, that area of rope must be examined daily (§ 75.1433(a)). Also, at least once every six months, nondestructive tests or diameter measurements are required to be performed on wire ropes (§ 75.1433(c)).\n\xa0\nWire ropes are required (§ 75.1434) to be removed from service, unless damaged or deteriorated sections are cut off, when any of the following conditions occurs:\n\xa0\n(a)Thenumberofwireswithinaropelaylength,excludingfillerwires,exceedseither\nFive percent of the total number of wires; or\nFifteen percent of the total number of wires within any strand;\n(b)amoreonewireinvalleystrandsinoneropelaylength;\n(c)Alossofmoreone-thirdoforiginaldiameterofouterwires;\n(d)Ropefromcorrosion;\n(e)Distortionofropestructure;\n(f)Heatfromanysource;\n(g)reductionduewearexceedssixpercentofdiametermeasurement;or\n(h)Lossofmorepercentofstrength\n\xa0\nWire Rope Nondestructive Testing (NDT)\nNDT is performed by pulling the wire rope through a testing instrument or test head. NDT detects areas where flaws (broken wires, corrosion, etc.) are present in a wire rope. NDT is a relative test that compares the “best” section of rope to the “worst” section. The loss of metallic area reported is the loss relative to the best portion of the rope and should not be interpreted as the loss of metallic area relative to a “new” rope. Accordingly, the regulations require an initial or baseline measurement of a new rope (§ 75.1432), and frequent subsequent tests to track the deterioration of the wire rope during its service life (§ 75.1433(c)).\nThe NDT test head generates a magnetic field and detects damage and deterioration in the wire rope by measuring changes in the magnetic field. The magnetic test head is connected to an electronic device that records data electronically and prints a visual representation of collected data on a strip chart.\nThe mine operator contracted the services of Certified NDT Inc. (MSHA Contractor ID “WBC”) to perform NDT. The test equipment used to examine this wire rope by Certified NDT took three measurements with three sensors or channels to analyze the wire rope.\n\xa0\nOuter and Inner Channels [aka Local Flaw (LF) Channels]\nThe first two channels are the Outer and Inner Channels. These channels detect the flaws (broken wires, corrosion, etc.) in a wire rope. Certified NDT used either the outer channel or inner channel during each test.\n\xa0\nHall Channel [aka Loss of Metallic Area (LMA) Channel]\nThe third measurement channel is the Hall Channel and it is produced from a Hall sensor located near the center of the instrument. This channel measures the losses in the rope’s cross-section caused by wear, corrosion etc. For each test, this channel is calibrated with a standardization rod of known area.\nWith the test head closed around a rope, the Inner sensor coil is located closest to the rope under test. The Hall sensor is the next closest to the rope and the Outer sensor coil is furthest away from a rope under test.\nCertified NDT performed NDT on the hoist rope on five separate occasions after the rope was installed on June 22, 2007. For each test, Certified NDT made charts showing the Inner or Outer Channel and Hall Channel. Certified NDT also gave the mine operator a one-page report for each test.\n\xa0\nAppendix B contains charts for six tests. These tests are labeled 1 through 6. For each test, two charts, chart A and chart B were recorded. \xa0Chart A for each test is the Inner or Outer channel, and chart B is the Hall channel. These charts were provided to MSHA by Newtown Energy, Inc., which requested the charts from Certified NDT following the accident.\nThe trace on each chart represents the data received from the test head as the wire rope travels through the test head. The data is recorded from left to right on \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0the chart. The left edge of the data is the starting point of the test, and the right side represents the end of the test.\nDamaged or deteriorated areas on the wire rope can be seen on the A charts where the trace becomes wider. For example, in Appendix B, the trace locations identified as “similar indications #1, #2, and #3” show areas where each trace is wider. These damaged or deteriorated areas are also called local flaws (LF).\nThe traces for the B charts move up or down when better or worse areas of the rope are detected, and should correspond to the areas where the A charts become wider or narrower. Loss of metallic area (LMA) is measured on the B charts.\nWhen the calibration information is known, accurate measurements of the high and low points (LMA) can be made.\n\xa0\nAnalysis of Certified NDT charts\nTest 1 in Appendix B, performed on May 16, 2007, is the last test performed on the wire rope previously used on this hoist. This wire rope was retired on or about June 22, 2007. Tests 2 through 6 are the tests performed on the wire rope involved in this fatality. These tests were performed on November 5, 2007, April 11, 2008, October 1, 2008, April 3, 2009, and August, 17, 2009.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\nTest number\n\n\nTest Date\n\n\nWire rope tested\n\n\n1\n\n\n5/16/2007\n\n\nPrevious wire rope\n\n\n2\n\n\n11/5/2007\n\n\nWire rope involved in fatality\n\n\n3\n\n\n4/11/2008\n\n\nWire rope involved in fatality\n\n\n4\n\n\n10/1/2008\n\n\nWire rope involved in fatality\n\n\n5\n\n\n4/3/2009\n\n\nWire rope involved in fatality\n\n\n6\n\n\n8/17/2009\n\n\nWire rope involved in fatality\n\n\xa0\nTests 2 and 3 were the first tests performed on the new wire rope and don’t indicate significant damage or deterioration. Significant and similar damage and deterioration are identified in tests 1, 4, and 5. See “similar indications #1, #2, and #3” on Appendix B. These similarities show that the environmental conditions that caused deterioration to both wire ropes did not change. These environmental conditions included: water dripping onto the wire rope at the 1,180 to 1,227 foot mark in the slope, and water dripping on the wire rope at the 740 foot mark in the slope.\nTest 6, the last test performed, does not show a progression of the damage or deterioration from tests 4 and 5. Rather, it shows practically no damage or deterioration. Test 6 resembles tests 2 and 3, the first tests on the new wire rope. Even though it was obvious that the charts from test 6 did not reflect the damage and deterioration in the wire rope identified in the charts for the previous two tests, Certified NDT did not investigate the cause of this discrepancy, nor did it report this anomaly to the mine operator. Certified NDT failed to take action regarding the charts for test 6 that were obviously incorrect, inconsistent with previous tests, and showed that the condition of the wire rope improved.\n\xa0\nAnalysis of Certified NDT written reports\nOn the five written reports of the tests performed on the rope that failed (tests 2 through 6), Certified NDT listed the following LMA measurements: 1.21%, 2.43%, 3.85%, 5.12%, and 5.79%. On the same reports, Certified NDT also listed the following estimated losses of breaking strength (LBS): 1.33%, 2.92, 4.62%, 6.14%, and 6.95%. Furthermore, on each report, the contractor stated, “Based on the criteria in this regulation [30 CFR], this rope is in satisfactory condition”.\nCertified NDT reported that the LMA and estimated LBS for test 6 were larger than those measured in previous tests. This finding is not substantiated by the charts that Certified NDT made following test 6. Certified NDT was negligent by providing reports to the mine operator for test 6 that where obviously inconsistent with charts for test 6.\nThe test 4 report was the first to mention damage and deterioration in the wire rope. This report states, “Anomalies indicative of abrasive wear, broken internal/external wires, and fretting corrosion were depicted in this hoist rope during this inspection.” These same anomalies are noted in the reports for tests 5 and 6. Additionally, the report for test 5 states, “The area of greatest wear is an area approximately 425-600 feet above the conveyance.” This result was not noted in the report for test 6. The failure point of the hoist rope in the accident was approximately 575 feet from the conveyance. None of the reports indicate that the contractor made visual examinations on the worst portion of the hoist rope or that caliper measurements of the rope diameter were taken on the area of greatest wear.\nIn the report for test 1, the LMA and estimated LBS are 8.15% and 9.78%, respectively. In this report, Certified NDT stated, “We recommend re-testing this rope within 60 days, or removing it from service.” It also stated that this wire rope was in satisfactory condition. Certified NDT did not report conducting a visual examination on the worst area identified by the testing.\n\xa0\nAnalysis of Certified NDT electronic data\nAfter analyzing all the charts that Certified NDT made and the reports that Certified NDT provided to the mine operator, MSHA requested Certified NDT’s electronic data for all six tests following an interview conducted on March 16, 2010. \xa0Certified NDT provided electronic data to MSHA on or about July 8, 2010. Data was provided for only four of the six tests conducted. They included the tests on May 16, 2007, November 5, 2007 April 3, 2009 and August 17, 2009.\nCertified NDT subsequently provided the calibration data for these tests.\nAppendix C contains the charts MSHA developed from this electronic data. Certified NDT stated that the real-time strip charts generated by the test equipment during NDT are only used to ensure electronic data is being collected by the test equipment. Certified NDT stated that these strip charts are not saved after NDT, but rather are discarded. Therefore, Certified NDT uses the electronic data to make new charts and write reports. Certified NDT stated that the written reports given to the mine operator are sent about one week after NDT is completed.\n\n\xa0\n\nTest number\n\n\nTest Date\n\n\nElectronic Data Provided?\n\n\nCorresponding charts in Appendix C\n\n\n1\n\n\n5/16/2007\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNot in Appendix C†\n\n\n2\n\n\n11/5/2007\n\n\nYes\n\n\n7\n\n\n3\n\n\n4/11/2008\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNA\n\n\n4\n\n\n10/1/2008\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNA\n\n\n5\n\n\n4/3/2009\n\n\nYes\n\n\n8\n\n\n6\n\n\n8/17/2009\n\n\nYes\n\n\n9\n\n\xa0\nAs in Appendix B, the A charts in Appendix C show LF, and the B charts show LMA. †For the May 16, 2007 test, the electronic data is generally consistent with the charts made by Certified NDT. For test 2, the electronic data shows a maximum LMA of 0.24% and an estimated LBS of 0.288%. For purposes of this analysis, LBS was calculated using the same method used by Certified NDT, that is, multiplying the LMA by a factor of 1.2.\nFor test 5, the electronic data provided for chart A was generally consistent with the test results provided to the mine operator. However, the electronic data for chart B was significantly different than the chart made by Certified NDT. This analysis of chart B shows a maximum LMA of at least 14.97% and estimated LBS of at least 17.96%. This estimated LBS exceeds the LBS retirement criterion of 10% (§ 75.1434(h)). Unfortunately, the contractor incorrectly reported a LMA of 5.12%, an estimated LBS of 6.14%, and that the wire rope was in satisfactory condition and in compliance with 30 CFR. Certified NDT did not report to the mine operator that the electronic data showed that the wire rope exceeded the retirement criterion, and not recommending that the wire rope be immediately removed from service.\nFor test 6, the electronic data shows a maximum LMA of 3.35% and an estimated LBS of 4.02%. This data is dramatically inconsistent with the data from the previous test, which shows a maximum LMA of 14.97% and estimated LBS of 17.96%, because it suggests that the wire rope gained a substantial amount of metal. This is a physical impossibility. Certified NDT failed to address obvious inconsistencies between the electronic data from tests 5 and 6, which should have alerted Certified NDT that its analyses were significantly flawed.\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\nInformation given to mine operator by Certified NDT\n\n\nMSHA analysis of Certified NDT electronic data\n\n\n\xa0\n\n\nTest\n\n\nTest Date\n\n\nMax\n%LMA\n\n\nMax\n%LBS\n\n\nWire Rope in Compliance?\n\n\nMax\n%LMA\n\n\nMax\n%LBS\n\n\nWire Rope in Compliance?\n\n\nAppendix C Chart\n\n\n2\n\n\n11/5/2007\n\n\n1.21\n\n\n1.33\n\n\nYes\n\n\n0.24\n\n\n0.29\n\n\nYes\n\n\n7\n\n\n3\n\n\n4/11/2008\n\n\n2.43\n\n\n2.92\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNEDP\n\n\nNEDP\n\n\nNEDP\n\n\nNA\n\n\n4\n\n\n10/1/2008\n\n\n3.58\n\n\n4.62\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNEDP\n\n\nNEDP\n\n\nNEDP\n\n\nNA\n\n\n5\n\n\n4/3/2009\n\n\n5.12\n\n\n6.14\n\n\nYes\n\n\n14.97*\n\n\n17.96*\n\n\nNo\n\n\n8\n\n\n6\n\n\n8/17/2009\n\n\n5.79\n\n\n6.95\n\n\nYes\n\n\n3.35\n\n\n4.02\n\n\nYes\n\n\n9\n\nNEDP = No Electronic Data Provided\n*Values are at least this magnitude\n\xa0\nMSHA NDT of the Wire Rope\nOn October 30, 2009, MSHA Technical Support personnel conducted NDT on the remaining portion of the rope (hoist side of the failure). NDT was conducted to determine the condition of the remaining active length of rope at the time of the accident. The testing also provided the necessary information to identify and subsequently remove any deteriorated sections of the rope, so that a new load end termination could be installed and the damaged equipment could be safely recovered from the mine.\n\xa0\nAfter testing approximately 360 feet of hoist rope, a severely deteriorated section of rope was encountered in which external broken wires caused the test head to hang up as the broken wires became jammed in the test head. The rope was stopped momentarily and the test head moved past the damaged area of rope.\nTesting continued until about 2,430 feet of rope had been nondestructively tested. The instrumentation was moved to the hoist house and a second test was conducted by drawing the hoist rope from the spool truck back onto the hoist. The hoist rope was marked for cutoff once 1,490 feet of rope had been put back onto the drum. The test was stopped after 2,150 feet of rope was tested. At this point, the NDT indicated a LMA of 35% from the best portion of rope tested (see Appendix D). This equates to an estimated LBS of 42% (using Certified NDT’s formula). This is the deteriorated area that jammed in the test head during MSHA’s first NDT. The hoist rope was visually examined at this point.\nThe worst portion identified by the MSHA NDT is the dry section of rope located 14 wraps into the third layer of rope on the drum. At the worst portion of rope identified by MSHA NDT, approximately 13 feet of rope was dry and not lubricated.\nThe outer wires of the rope were worn. \xa0Caliper measurement taken on the dry section of rope indicated diameters of 1.079, 1.084, 1.052, 1.047, and 1.066 inches. These caliper measurements were taken with the rope in an unloaded condition. Under a loaded condition (i.e. the brakeman car attached to the rope), the rope diameter measurements likely would have shown a smaller diameter.\n\xa0\nIn the worst portion of the rope, one of the strands was visibly damaged and the strand center was exposed. This center strand had no visible lubricant and exhibited broken wires and severe pitting corrosion. The outer wires of the rope, throughout this dry area, showed visible signs of pitting corrosion. Based on the MSHA NDT evaluation, caliper measurement, and visual examination, the worst portion of the hoist rope identified by MSHA NDT exceeded the retirement criteria listed in Title 30 CFR Part 75.1434(a)(1), (a)(2), (d), (g), and (h).\nENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS\nWith the Brakeman Car parked at the bottom of the slope and the load connection on the curve, the point of rope failure occurred in the vicinity where the water was dripping at the 1,180-1,227 feet mark. The water dripping at the 740 feet mark in the slope would correspond to the worst portion of the rope (35% LMA) identified by MSHA NDT.\n\xa0\nVISUAL EXAMINATIONS – RECORD REVIEW\nA review of the “Report of Daily Inspection of Hoisting Equipment” records was conducted from the date of accident to August 1, 2009. No damage to, or deterioration in, the wire rope was recorded in these record books. Also, no finding of improper lubrication was recorded in these examination books.\nThe oldest examination book had “Full 8-28-09” printed on the cover. The book also had the installation date of the rope documented on the cover as June 22, 2007 and three measurements: 11940 at 525 feet, 11785 at 1,167 feet, and 1190 at\n1,750 feet respectively. The numbers 11940, 11785, and 1190 are the initial caliper measurements of 1.1940, 1.1785, and 1.1900 inches respectively. The average of these three measurements produces a baseline of 1.1875 inches. The cover of this book also had “Retire-1116” printed on the cover. If 1.1875 inches is multiplied by 0.94, a result of 1.11625 is obtained. Title 30 CFR Part 75.1434 (g) states that unless rope damage or deterioration is removed by cutoff, wire ropes shall be removed from service when the diameter reduction due to wear exceeds six percent of the base line diameter measurement. Therefore, if caliper measurements were taken on a section of wire rope that exhibited wear to the outer wires, 1.116 inches would be an appropriate number to remove that section by cutoff, or retire the entire rope.\nThe review of the examination books indicated that the rope was cleaned on five occasions. These dates included August 3 and 31, September 14 and 28, and\nOctober 12, 2009. Each time the rope was cleaned, the task was completed on the 3rd shift by Morgan. The wire rope is cleaned to remove dirt, debris, and old lubrication. Afterward, it should be re-lubricated. No notations were made in the examination books that indicated the rope was lubricated after it was cleaned. \xa0The examination book indicates that the last bimonthly brake test on \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0the brakeman car was conducted by Boggs on September 21, 2009. No notations were made in the examination book that indicated any adjustments to the brakes were made. The final NDT conducted by Certified NDT on August 17, 2009, was not documented in the examination book. \xa0On the day of the accident, the examination book indicated that the daily visual examination was conducted by Morgan at 4:30 a.m., several hours before sunrise.\n\xa0\nVISUAL EXAMINATIONS OF THE HOIST WIRE ROPE\nRope examinations were conducted daily by Morgan. These examinations did not detect obvious and significant damage to, and deterioration in, the wire rope. Also, the examinations did not detect significant areas of improper lubrication.\nThe rope was examined on the surface between the collar of the slope and the sheave wheel. The rope was examined while the conveyance was lowered into the slope at approximately 200 feet per minute (fpm). With the examination being conducted at this fixed location, stress locations could not be properly examined where the rope leaves the drum, at drum crossovers, and at change-of– layer regions. An adequate examination for structural damage, corrosion, and improper lubrication could not be properly conducted while the rope was traveling at 200 fpm.\n\xa0\nGuide rollers were installed on the mine floor and coal rib at approximately 20 foot intervals for the wire rope to roll on to prevent wear from dragging along the mine floor and coal rib. Eighteen of these rollers (approximately 20%) were either frozen, missing, or had the cable guides missing. These conditions were causing excessive wear and damage to the rope.\nThe damage to the rollers appeared to have occurred over a period of at least several weeks. Pre-shift examinations were conducted in the slope 3 times a day by numerous examiners. The damaged rollers were obvious and the damaged rollers were not reported to management. No notations relating to damaged or worn rollers were recorded in the Pre-shift Mine Examiner’s Report.\n\xa0\nTRAINING\n30 CFR does not require any training that would instruct wire rope examiners on the proper procedures to examine wire ropes.\n\xa0\nRon Petty, President of Certified NDT, performed all tests on the wire rope. He has been performing NDT since 1989, and has been performing about 200 tests a year at both mine and non-mine facilities. Petty has certifications and qualifications in ultrasonic, magnetic particle, electromagnetic methods, visual, and penetrant forms of NDT. The NDT equipment Petty used on this wire rope was a Meraster MD120 supplied by a company in Poland, Zawada NDT. Mr. Petty spent several weeks in Poland receiving training on how to use this NDT equipment.\n\xa0\nOTHER CERTIFIED NDT OBSERVATIONS\nOn each report, Certified NDT incorrectly stated the cross sectional area for a new wire rope is 0.482 in2. The rope manufacturer states that the cross sectional area is 0.637 in2.\nThe calibration information listed by Certified NDT on the reports given to the mine operator is significantly different than the calibration shown on the electronic data that Certified NDT provided to MSHA. The reports all show a calibration voltage of 0.47 mV, but the electronic data show calibration voltages for tests 2, 5, and 6 were 3.5 mV, 0.2 mV, and 0.2 to 0.3 mV respectively.\nCertified NDT used a test head that has a distance wheel; however, the distance wheel was not used for any testing dating back to May 2007.\nCertified NDT provided its “Electromagnetic Wire Rope Examination Procedure” following MSHA’s second request for information. The procedures are dated November 1992, but state that they use the guidelines and recommendations in the 1993 edition of the American Society of Test Materials (ASTM) E1571 standard. The Examination Procedure also states that ASTM E1571 1993 “shall be considered as part of this procedure.” ASTM E1571 1993 did not exist in November 1992 because it was issued 10 months later on September 15, 1993. The Table of Contents for Certified NDT’s “Electromagnetic Wire Rope Examination Procedure” lists seven sections. Sections 3.0 Examination Standardization, 4.0 Equipment, and 5.0 Time of Inspection, are not in the document even though they are listed in the Table of Contents. \xa0Sections 6.0 Personnel and 7.0 Records are provided, however, all of Section 7.0 is numbered as if it is in Section 9.0, a Section that does not exist. Section 8.0, “Calibration Procedures,” was provided as the last page of the document. The calibration procedures provided address records and laboratory calibration with steel rod reference standards, and does not address the critical field calibration of a wire rope.\nASTM E1571 1993 states, “It is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.” During an interview, Petty stated that he visually examines the wire rope: (1) in areas where NDT indicates strength losses close to 10%, (2) if he sees an abrupt change in the traces for LMA and/or LF, or\n(3) if there are dramatic differences from the previous test. Tests 5 and 6 met these criteria but Petty did not visually examine the wire rope. The manufacturer of Petty’s NDT instrumentation recommends periodic visual inspection of ropes and that one should be able to observe and successively see the increasing broken wires and other defects in the wire rope from test to test.\n\xa0', '\n\xa0\nCertified NDT stated that the Outer Channel of the instrumentation was consistent with MSHA’s instrument Local Flaw (LF) Channel. The instrument manufacturer and owner of the company, Mr. Kazimierz Zawada, was contacted and reported that the Outer Channel is designed to only be used with the Inner Channel to estimate the depth of a defect in a rope cross section.\n\xa0\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS\n\xa0\nAn analysis was conducted to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were corrected through reasonable management controls. The following root causes were identified.\nRoot Cause: Certified NDT did not report the true condition of the wire rope and did not follow prudent examination practices. Rather, Certified NDT reported that the wire rope complied with 30 CFR, even though the test data showed that the wire rope met the retirement criteria in 30 CFR. Newtown Energy did not provide adequate oversight of the NDT performed by Certified NDT.\nCorrective Actions: Certified NDT revised its written wire rope examination procedures. These written procedures now list proper field standardization of test equipment, appropriate conditions that necessitate a visual inspection of the wire rope, when rope diameter measurements will conducted, and a requirement to protect strip charts from deterioration, as well as retain strip charts until the wire rope is retired. The revised written procedures also state that the testing of the rope will comply with the current version of ASTM E1571 “Standard Practice for Electromagnetic Examination of Ferromagnetic Wire Rope”.\nFurthermore, for two years after MSHA’s report is released, Certified NDT will notify MSHA at least 7 calendar days prior to each non-destructive testing it performs on a wire rope at a mine site, in order to allow MSHA to monitor and evaluate any such testing.\nNewtown Energy developed written procedures to review the NDT test results they receive from NDT contractors. Newtown Energy trained miners in these new procedures. Newtown Energy has contracted the services of Rotesco Inc. to perform future NDT on the hoist wire rope.\nRoot Cause: The mine operator did not have an effective program to properly conduct visual examinations for structural damage, corrosion, improper lubrication, wear and broken wires at stress points were not performed. The examinations conducted failed to detect obvious and significant damage, deterioration, and improper lubrication.\nCorrective Actions: Newtown Energy developed written visual examination procedures. The procedures require the examiner who performs the 14 day examination to examine the hoist wire rope at an inspection speed no greater than 50 feet per minute, and to examine the rope in a well-lighted area. The procedures require the examiner to comply with the provisions of 30 CFR 75.1433(a) and (d). The procedures require the examiner to record that the examination was conducted, as well as any of the conditions described in 30 CFR 75.1433(a), in a record book titled “14 Day Wire Rope Exam.” Mine management reinstructed examiners on proper wire rope examinations.\nNewtown Energy also developed written hoist wire rope safety precautions. These precautions require the following. Baseline measurements will be taken with an electronic caliper on three hundred foot increments for new wire ropes. The baseline measurements will be performed after the rope has stretched but before wear begins, and will always be taken within three weeks after installation. The baseline measurements will be recorded in a hoist book. The first NDT will be performed within one month after the installation of a new wire rope, and will be performed a least once every six months thereafter. In addition to the 14-day wire rope examination, a visual examination of the \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0normally used portion of the wire rope will be performed every day the slope hoist is operated and recorded in the hoist book. This visual examination will be performed by dropping the hoist car to the bottom at a speed no greater than 100 feet per minute. The rope will be examined near the sheave wheel outside where the examiner can see the top and bottom side of the rope.\nRoot Cause: The mine operator did not have an effective policy to ensure that miners did not ride on a conveyance whose weight exceeded the braking capacity of the brakeman car.\nCorrective Actions: Newtown Energy developed a written policy regarding personnel and supply conveyances. The policy prohibits anyone from riding the brakeman car when the conveyance is used to drop or pull supplies or equipment, or when the brakeman car is attached to any other car. The policy also requires at least one person to be in the seat that has access to the emergency stop switch when personnel are being hoisted up or down the slope. The policy states that this person must be trained in the use of the emergency stop switch.\nNewtown Energy trained miners in this new policy.\nRoot Cause: The mine operator did not have an effective policy, procedure, or program to ensure that miners remain in safe locations at the bottom of the slope when men and material were being hoisted into and out of the mine.Corrective Actions: Newtown Energy established a new waiting area at the bottom of the slope where miners could position themselves when the hoist was inoperation. Newtown Energy instructed the miners where to position themselves when the hoist was in operation.\nAdditionally, Newtown Energy developed new written procedures regarding personnel and supply conveyances. The procedures require that personnel enter or exit the brakeman car only after it has come to a complete stop. Also, the procedures prohibit personnel from being in the track slope or track bottom when the conveyance is being hoisted. Approaches to the bottom track area will be clearly marked with signs and visible warning lights, and the slope is equipped with flashing warning lights as the conveyance is in movement. A one minute delay with alarms will be implemented to allow personnel to have time to move to safety. When the conveyance is not in use it will be parked on the surface with the switch thrown in the direction of the yard.\n': '\xa0\xa0', '\nCONCLUSION\nThe accident occurred when the slope hoist rope broke resulting in a runaway of the brakeman car, mine locomotive and loaded rail car down a 16 degree, 1,750 foot slope. The victim was at the bottom of the slope when he was struck by the conveyance. Certif ied NDT did not report that the wire rope exceeded the retirement criterion of 10% loss of strength. The mine operator did not perform adequate wire rope examinations for structural damage, corrosion, improper lubrication, wear and broken wires at stress points. \xa0Also, the mine operator did not have an effective policy to prevent miners from riding a conveyance whose weight exceeded the braking capacity of the brakeman car. Furthermore, the operator did not have an effective program to ensure miners were positioned in safe locations when near the slope bottom while a conveyance is being hoisted.\n\xa0\nApproved By:\nRobert G. Hardman District Manager\n': '\xa0'}",
