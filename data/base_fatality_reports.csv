Non-Metal|Freeport-McMoRan Inc|Copper Ore NEC|2019-03-06T00:00:00-05:00|NM|New Mexico|on march 6, 2019, at 7:30 a.m., komatsu employees timothy rivers, mechanic/victim; ralph begay, field service technician; and james jarrett, master field service technician, arrived at the mine site to work on the no. 24 shovel.  after a safety meeting, komatsu employee ryan thygerson, lead man, assigned various tasks to rivers, begay and jarrett to prepare to lift the no. 24 shovel using four bottle jacks.at 10:00 a.m., rivers, begay, jarrett, and thygerson prepared the pump system and began the process of raising the bottle jacks into position.  the pumping system applied pressure to the bottle jacks.  however, the bottle jacks did not move, the gauges on the pressure side of the pump read between 7,000 and 7,500 psi, and hydraulic oil leaked out of the relief valves on the no. 2 and no. 3 bottle jacks (see appendix a - accident diagram).  the contractors shut down the pump and determined that the pump’s return valves were closed.  the contractors opened the return valves and restarted the pump.  oil stopped leaking out of the relief valves on the no. 2 and no. 3 bottle jacks, and the bottle jack rams began to raise.  the valves were turned off to hold the bottle jacks in place once the two bottle jacks touched the bottom of the shovel.  no. 1 and 4 jacks did not raise.a loose fitting on the return line was found on the no. 1 bottle jack. the fitting was tightened and the no. 1 bottle jack ram raised up when the pump was turned on.  once the ram contacted the bottom of the shovel, the valves for the no. 1 bottle jack were closed to hold the bottle jack in position. the no. 4 bottle jack still was not working. the pump was shut off and begay and rivers inspected the no. 4 bottle jack for leaks but found none. begay and rivers were in the immediate vicinity of the no. 4 bottle jack when the pump was restarted.  jarrett stated that the bottle jack ram did not rise, and the pump gauge read approximately 9,000 psi.  after approximately two to three seconds, the relief valve ejected out of the no. 4 bottle jack cylinder, striking rivers in the left abdomen. oil from the bottle jack sprayed onto begay, who turned to see rivers kneeling down facing away from begay, and holding his left ear and left side.  begay pulled rivers out from under the shovel, and ordered a mayday call for broadcast over the mine’s radio system. begay and jarrett attended to rivers until trained emergency medical technicians (emt) from the mine arrived at the accident scene.  tyrone mine employee henry monroe, truck driver/emt, arrived at the accident site and assessed rivers.  monroe was unable to find a pulse or detect any breathing.  monroe started cardiopulmonary resuscitation until the paramedics took over and transported him to gila regional medical center in silver city, new mexico, where he was pronounced dead at 11:32 a.m. by preston maxim, md. tyrone mine employee james cook, senior health and safety specialist, called the department of labor’s national contact center (dolncc) at 10:43 a.m. on march 6, 2019, and notified msha of the accident.  msha dispatched south central district enforcement employees lee cruise, mine safety and health inspector and robert seelke, supervisory mine safety and health inspector to the mine site to secure the scene.  upon arrival, msha issued an order under provisions of section 103(k) of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners and began the investigation.msha’s accident investigation team, with the assistance of fred t. marshall, msha technical support mechanical engineer, conducted a physical examination of the accident scene, interviewed mine employees and contractors, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident.  msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, miners and contractor employees.  see appendix b for persons participating in the investigation.the accident occurred at the shovel rebuild area in the valencia pit.  the contractors were preparing to rebuild the crawler tracks and install power stairs to access the shovel.  the rebuild project started on march 4, 2019, komatsu performed the major portions of the rebuild.the contractors positioned the bottle jacks under the shovel on march 5, 2019 and determined the pump used to pressure the bottle jack system did not work.  a replacement pump was brought to the site the following morning.on the day of the accident, rivers, begay, jarrett, and thygerson prepared to lift the shovel using the bottle jack system.  rivers and begay were standing near the bottle jacks while thygerson and jarrett were at the pump when the accident occurred.  begay estimated that rivers was approximately three feet from the no. 4 bottle jack and in direct line with the relief valve when it was ejected from the bottle jack.exponent, an independent laboratory, tested the bottle jack system.  fred t. marshall, msha technical support mechanical engineer, was present during the testing.  exponent determined that the damage patterns on the failed pressure relief valve show that physical damage to the valve had occurred prior to the accident, and not as a result of the accident.  the lack of any threads remaining on the valve body, the surface damage to the entire length and circumference of the unthreaded portion of the valve body, the lack of threads in the first portion of the cylinder port, and contact marks on the underside of the hex head all show that the pressure relief valve sustained an impact force, which drove it into the port, until portions of the hex head contacted the cylinder body.  aligning the contact marks on the underside of the pressure relief valve’s hex head with machining marks on the cylinder body shows the relative orientation of the face of the pressure relief valve prior to ejection from the cylinder port.  as a result of the physical damage, the relief valve had only an interference fit, like a cork, to hold it in the cylinder port instead of the integrity of a threaded connection.  when the work crew turned on the pump to raise the bottle jack, the pressure caused the damaged relief valve to eject out of the port.weatherthe weather at the time of the accident was clear, with a west wind of 26 mph, and a temperature of 72 degrees fahrenheit.  investigators did not consider the weather to be a factor in the accident.equipment involved in the accidentthe bottle jack involved in the accident was an enerpac rr-series model rr-50024, a double-acting cylinder with a nominal stroke of 24 inches and a rated lift capacity of 500 tons.  the bottle jacks were hydraulically powered by an electrically operated hydraulic power unit, catalog number su10132 model a, serial number 351312, in both directions, i.e., to extend and retract the bottle jacks or to both raise and lower the bottle jack, respectively.  product information supplied by one of the contractor’s representatives shows that the hydraulic power unit had an adjustable hydraulic output pressure setting of 1,000 to 10,000 psi and that the two-way bottle jack’s maximum operating pressure was 10,000 psi.there is a pressure relief valve inserted directly into the retract side of the cylinder on the bottle jack using a threaded connection.  the relief valve has a relief setting of 11,000 – 11,500 psi and when this is exceeded the relief valve vents hydraulic fluid to the atmosphere.  because the jack is double acting, the relief valve can vent hydraulic fluid to the atmosphere when the jack is not under load with a supply pressure as low as 6,125 – 6,400 psi.the operator generally raises the bottle jack by depressing a three-position switch on a hand control (pendant).  a hydraulic valve electrically controlled by the pendant then directs pump pressure and flow to the base side (bottom side) of the bottle jack’s piston to extend the cylinder rod.  the upward movement of the piston forces the hydraulic oil on the rod side (top side) of the piston out of the top of the bottle jack.  when raising the bottle jack, a larger amount of oil is going into the bottle jack than that coming out of the bottle jack.  the operator releases the pendant switch to stop raising the bottle jack.  to lower the bottle jack, the operator depresses the three-position switch in the opposite direction.  the bottle jack lowers by directing hydraulic pressure and flow in the opposite direction of that for raising it.  in addition, the speed of the bottle jack can be slowed by using manually controlled needle valves to restrict flow to, or from, the bottle jack. the bottle jack and pump assembly included an electrically driven two-stage hydraulic pump with a preset safety relief valve. the pressure relief valve in the retract side of the bottle jack was the component that mechanically failed and was ejected from a threaded port of the bottle jack.

Resource Partners LP|Coal (Bituminous)|2019-01-05T00:00:00-05:00|IL|Illinois|on friday, january 4, 2019, john d. ditterline, contract laborer, reported to work on the 3rd shift which began at 11:00 p.m.  harvey niehaus, assistant mine manager, was traveling through the main shaft bottom area and heard a “whistling” sound near the stopping in the no. 4 entry between footage markers 200 and 300.  niehaus continued traveling to check on a belt and electrical power move, and then returned and found the stopping was bowing in the center and leaking across the top.  niehaus told jim payne, supply man, to remove the supply trailers from the crosscut and bring one pallet of concrete blocks to the damaged stopping location.niehaus next traveled to the 4 left head drive area and told matthew wright, johnny hettercheidt, and jason wilson, contract laborers, to travel to the bottom area and start working on building a stopping inby the damaged stopping.  niehaus stopped at the west main head drive where ditterline and john holland, general laborer, were working.  he told them to travel to the bottom area and help the other miners build a new stopping.  niehaus proceeded on to the 9 left mining section.holland and ditterline arrived at the bottom area and met with wright, hettercheidt, and wilson to build the stopping.  the area where they were building the new stopping had two 110 volt shop lights that needed to be removed.  to determine the location of the power cable that provided power to the lights, ditterline traveled outby towards the pneumatic airlock doors located in the crosscut between entry 4 and entry 5 at footage markers 100 and 200 (see appendix a).  he walked through the inby set of doors and closed them behind him, following the power cable for the lights.  surveillance video shows that after ditterline activated the outby set of pneumatic airlock doors, at 3:18 a.m., the indicator lights for the doors began flashing, which means the doors went into fault condition.  there were no witnesses to what followed, but evidence indicated that ditterline walked up to the doors, opened the slide access door and the airlock doors opened suddenly, hitting him and pinning him between one of the doors and the concrete barrier.  when the doors opened, holland, hettercheidt, wright and wilson could hear and feel the air velocity increase at the damaged stopping.payne was working nearby and walked through the boot wash area to the shaft bottom.  once at the hoist, payne noticed the opened airlock doors and a leg extending through the slide access door.  he ran toward the airlock doors and found ditterline at 3:22 a.m., pinned behind the left airlock door.  ditterline was unresponsive.  payne immediately called on the radio for holland to come to the shaft bottom.  holland, wright, hettercheidt, and wilson traveled to the shaft bottom to help.  holland tried to clear the fault condition at both sets of electronic sensors for the doors.  once the doors started to close, wilson and hettercheidt pulled ditterline out and laid him on his back.  ditterline was still unresponsive.  wilson, who is an emergency medical technician (emt), and holland started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr).  hettercheidt assisted with cpr while wright went to get an automated external defibrillator (aed) from the shop.niehaus heard payne call on the radio and traveled from the 9 left mining section outby towards the bottom area.  niehaus picked up michael welch, contract laborer/emt and they proceeded to the accident scene.  when niehaus and welch arrived, wilson and holland were still performing cpr.  an aed was applied to ditterline, but the diagnostic function of the aed indicated that no shock be administered.  they placed ditterline on a backboard and carried him to the hoist for transport to the surface.  upon arrival on the surface, harre ambulance service took over care of ditterline and transported him to hamilton memorial hospital.james steven bowling, hamilton county coroner, pronounced ditterline dead at 4:45 a.m.  dr. james jacoby, forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy and stated that ditterline’s death was due to a cardiomyopathy.  coroner bowling listed cardiomyopathy as the cause of death on the state of illinois certificate of death worksheet.  the worksheet also states that the manner of death was “natural.”when a miner’s death is not conclusively determined to be chargeable to the mining industry, msha submits the case, including facts and supporting information, to the msha chargeability review committee (review committee) for a decision.  the review committee has been in existence since 2008 and has reviewed over 500 cases.  the review committee is currently comprised of the following persons:after a thorough review of the facts and medical information, the review committee found that, “acute stress cardiomyopathy can occur when an individual is exposed to sudden, intense physical or emotional (grief, fear) stress which causes rapid and severe heart muscle weakness.  acute stress cardiomyopathy can mimic a myocardial infarction (a heart attack) even in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease.”  “because 1) mr. ditterline was seen on video moments before the door accident in no apparent distress, 2) the door slam was a significantly traumatic event, and 3) the death occurred at the time of the door slam, the review committee members [concluded] it is probable that the trauma of the accident triggered acute stress cardiomyopathy.”  therefore, the review committee stated, “mr. ditterline’s death should be charged to the mining industry.”

examiner; and josh fuller, section foreman, their work assignments on the section 004 mmu.  the miners were working the third shift that started at 10:30 p.m.  one of grubb’s duties was to replace the bad conveyor belt splice on the no. 7 conveyor belt.at 10:00 p.m., saylor began to conduct a pre-shift examination of mine seals, located about 1,050 feet away from the main portal.  this examination is required to be completed before other third shift miners are allowed to enter the mine.  after completing this examination, saylor returned to the surface area of the main portal.at approximately 10:30 p.m., fuller and seven section maintenance crew members – keaton dillman, scoop operator; gary kirby, roof bolter; james brown, scoop operator; brent raleigh, roof bolter; donnie burton, continuous mining machine operator; and johnny ray and richard baker, electricians – traveled to the section in a personnel carrier.  they arrived at the section at about 11:45 p.m. and began their assigned tasks.  tim combs, electrician, arrived at the section at 1:00 a.m.grubbs and james belt, scoop operator/outby general laborer, who was assigned to work with grubbs to replace the bad conveyor belt splice on the no. 7 conveyor belt, waited on the mine surface for a personnel carrier to take them into the mine.  at 12:28 a.m., a carrier became available and they entered the mine.  on their way to the no. 7 conveyor belt, they stopped at the no. 1 conveyor belt to check previous splices and the no. 2 conveyor belt to gather splicing tools and materials.at 11:43 p.m., saylor reentered the mine to conduct on-shift examinations of all mine conveyor belts.  his plan was to start with the no. 1 conveyor belt and work his way to the no. 12 conveyor belt.  all conveyor belts were running at this time.  he stopped at the no. 7 conveyor belt head drive at crosscut 128 to take his lunch break.  grubbs and belt arrived while saylor was eating lunch.  while saylor and grubbs talked, belt adjusted the take-up at the no. 7 conveyor belt head drive to prepare for the conveyor belt splice.grubbs and belt then traveled inby to crosscut 142 of the no. 7 conveyor belt entry to replace the bad conveyor belt splice.  belt stopped the conveyor belt switch by using a belt switch located at crosscut 141 and positioned the splice at approximately 38 feet away from the center of crosscut 142.  grubbs and belt worked together to secure the conveyor belt clamps on both ends of the splice.  once the conveyor belt clamps were secured, grubbs and belt used two chain ratchets in conjunction with the conveyor belt clamps to pull slack in the conveyor belt.  they then removed the splice by cutting between the clamps.  belt planned to install new  splicing materials to the outby end of the conveyor belt, and grubbs would then do the same to the inby end.belt completed the outby end of the conveyor belt splice.  grubbs knelt on the bottom conveyor belt to start installing the inby side of the conveyor belt splice.  belt was handing tools and supplies to grubbs across the beltline.meanwhile, saylor finished his lunch at the no. 7 conveyor belt head drive and traveled inby along the conveyor belt entry to continue his examination.  at crosscut 135, the clearance between the conveyor belt and the rib narrowed.  saylor’s personnel carrier got stuck on the outby corner of the block of coal, causing the rear wheel to lose contact with the mine floor.  saylor placed a bottom roller hanger and rocks under the wheels to regain traction.  when he maneuvered to regain traction, the personnel carrier pulled apart the conveyor belt switch wires where a splice had been made to connect the wires to the remote cable.  saylor decided to repair the switch wires and remote cable by splicing the matching colors of the wires and remote cable together.  this inadvertently started the no. 7 conveyor belt at about 2:15 a.m.as the conveyor belt began to move, grubbs became entangled in one of the loose ends of a ratchet chain used as part of the clamping process and was dragged over the top troughing rollers.  belt saw grubbs being pulled by the belt and immediately crossed under the conveyor belt, jumped onto the personnel carrier, and headed toward the head drive to disconnect power to the no. 7 conveyor belt.still at crosscut 135, saylor heard a noise, which he surmised was from a bad conveyor belt splice.  the noise became louder and sounded more like the conveyor belt was broken and was contacting the troughing rollers.  he saw reflective material on the conveyor belt and realized that something was wrong.  he instinctively flipped the conveyor belt switch in the opposite direction, but the conveyor belt did not immediately stop.  saylor then pulled apart the conveyor belt switch wires he had just spliced.  the portion of the conveyor belt where grubbs was located coasted to a stop at crosscut 135.  the belt had traveled a total of about 585 feet (see appendix b) with grubbs on it. saylor observed that grubbs was seriously injured, but was conscious and talking.  saylor ran into the adjacent roadway and used his cap light to signal for help.  belt saw saylor in the roadway and continued to crosscut 135 where grubbs was located.  he remained with grubbs while saylor drove to the nearest mine phone located approximately 630 feet away.  at about 2:20 a.m., saylor called dallas halcomb, dispatcher, and directed him to contact emergency services and notify appropriate federal and state officials of the accident.  saylor also asked halcomb to ask all miners on the section to come to the accident scene and bring first aid supplies.  saylor traveled back to assist belt in freeing grubbs.halcomb contacted local emergency services for an ambulance, and at 2:27 a.m. called the department of labor national contact center (contact center) to report the accident.  he also called mike dempsey, mine superintendent.anthony boggs, mine foreman, entered the mine at 1:32 a.m., arriving on the section at 2:26 a.m.  soon after arriving, he learned about the accident from halcomb.  boggs then told fuller, who was also an emergency medical technician, about the accident and ordered some of the crew to gather first aid supplies and travel to the accident site.  at 2:30 a.m., boggs and fuller, as well as crew members dillman, kirby, brown, combs, and raleigh, traveled to the accident site.  three other miners, burton, ray, and baker, remained on the section.while waiting for help to arrive, saylor and belt continued their efforts to free grubbs from the conveyor belt and ratchet chains.  belt took measures to control his bleeding, while saylor traveled to the power center and disconnected the plug for the no. 7 conveyor belt drive and take-up.  he also began clearing all supplies out of his personnel carrier so grubbs could be transported out of the mine.  during this time, grubbs remained conscious and was talking.at about 2:50 a.m., boggs, fuller and the other crew members from the section arrived at the accident scene.  fuller conducted a medical assessment of grubbs, while the miners worked together to remove grubbs from the conveyor belt structure and ratchet chain.  by this time, grubbs had stopped talking but still had a pulse and was breathing.  the miners placed grubbs on a backboard and onto a personnel carrier to be transported to the surface.  kirby drove the personnel carrier, while fuller and brown continued to treat grubbs’ injuries.  belt was also with grubbs, stabilizing his spine.  boggs, saylor, dillman, combs, and raleigh followed in separate personnel carriers.at about 3:05 a.m., grubbs stopped breathing.  fuller checked for a pulse but found none and immediately began cardio pulmonary resuscitation (cpr), which he continued until they reached the surface at approximately 3:15 a.m.  grubbs was placed in the waiting ambulance by members of the transtar emergency medical service (ems).moments later, an ems crew member notified the surrounding miners that grubbs did not survive.  ems personnel contacted their dispatcher to request the coroner to travel to the mine.  philip bianchi, harlan county coroner, arrived at the mine at approximately 4:20 a.m.  bianchi recorded 3:17 a.m. as the time of death.

the day shift at the south portal of the mine.  he attended a short meeting with greg hunt, shift maintenance foreman, who assigned him to assist unit no. 4 mechanics with coal hauler battery repairs.  the outby mechanics normally work in pairs to conduct maintenance and repair work on the unit and outby equipment throughout the mine.  this day, however, they were split up so they could cover a larger area of the mine.  mine tracking system records indicate that williams entered the mine via the elevator at 6:35 a.m.  he then drove a 2-person alpha diesel personnel carrier, company number kwt 36, along the travelway/secondary escapeway toward unit no. 4. williams arrived on unit no. 4 at 7:08 a.m. and helped mechanics joshua roberts, doug lauderdale and ryan nickless repair damaged batteries.  after completing the work on the batteries at about 11:38 a.m., williams asked the group if they needed help with anything else.  when they replied “no,” at 11:39 a.m., williams left unit no. 4, and drove the diesel personnel carrier along the same travelway after leaving unit no. 4.  he did not tell the miners where he was going.  the mine tracking system showed williams traveled approximately 20,000 feet in the personnel carrier along the travelway, and at about 11:50 a.m. struck the right coal rib between crosscuts 135 and 136 of the m5 travelway.  the diesel personnel carrier rolled onto its left side and williams was partially ejected.  he was trapped between the personnel carrier’s canopy and the mine floor.  there were no witnesses to the accident.a carbon monoxide (co) sensor located between crosscuts 137 and 138 on the m5 conveyor belt measured 5 ppm of co and went into alert status at 12:00 p.m.  miranda lewlyn, mine dispatcher, looked on the tracking system and noted that williams was located near this sensor.  she sent him a text message asking if there was diesel equipment parked in the area to see if that was the source of the co.  the tracking system computer showed that he did not read this message.  investigators determined that williams read text messages sent before the accident, indicating that the accident occurred before lewlyn sent this message.clayton wise, mine examiner, was driving a personnel carrier while conducting a preshift examination of the travelways for the oncoming shift.  at crosscut 30 of the m6 travelway, he encountered light smoke and smelled diesel exhaust.  wise attempted to find the source of smoke, and, as he traveled, the smoke cleared.  he could see lights in the travelway ahead of him, but could not identify them.  wise arrived at the accident scene at 12:27 p.m. and found the personnel carrier lying on its side.  he immediately ran to the vehicle to see if someone was injured.  wise found williams trapped under the personnel carrier with the canopy on his chest. wise checked for vital signs but could not find a pulse.  he then attempted to lift the personnel carrier off of williams by hand but was unable to do so.  at about 12:29 p.m., wise notified dispatch of the accident and requested assistance.  lewlyn texted scotty kent, shift mine manager, and l. kenny chaney, “call dispatch asap.”  they contacted lewlyn and she provided information about the accident.  they proceeded to the accident scene in kent’s personnel carrier.  while on their way, they encountered hunt and asked him to go to unit no. 1, and bring the unit no. 1 ambulance to the accident scene.  lewlyn contacted james todd, unit no. 2 mechanic, at 12:46 p.m., to tell him to take the unit no. 2 ambulance to the accident scene.  she also contacted dowell and relayed information about the accident to him.  at 12:47 p.m., dowell called 911 to request the assistance of emergency personnel.kent and chaney arrived at the scene at 12:51 p.m.  they determined that a forklift would be needed to lift the personnel carrier off williams.  they traveled to crosscut 1 on the m6 travelway to get a diesel forklift.  chaney dropped kent off at this location and returned to the accident scene.hunt and todd arrived at the accident scene at approximately 12:56 p.m. with the ambulances.  chaney and wise gathered wood blocks to support the personnel carrier once it was lifted off williams.  at 1:00 p.m., kent returned to the accident scene with the forklift, which lifted the personnel carrier.  due to the extent of willams’ injuries, cpr was not started.  williams was placed in a basket/backboard and then into the unit no. 2 ambulance.  todd and kent transported him to the elevator.  chaney and kent accompanied williams to the surface, arriving at 1:23 p.m.  the knox county ems ambulance was waiting on the surface.  williams was placed in the ambulance and held

beckley, wv. k. owens informed investigators that he received a text message on his personal cell phone from the company’s cell phone.  the text message informed k. owens that electrical power had been lost.  k. owens then began sending texts to whitlock’s personal cell phone regarding electrical work.hartley informed msha investigators that whitlock instructed him to drive to the substation, approximately 8,000 feet from the mining machine, to lock out the power source.  hartley stated he locked out the power and verified the load break switch was open by using a flashlight to look through the sight glass.  hartley informed whitlock by text message that the power was locked out and waited for whitlock’s instructions.  whitlock’s cell phone records indicate at 4:51 p.m. a text message was received from hartley stating “it is locked out.”harvey stated he and cassell assisted whitlock in making the mining machine trailing cable repair on the ground near the mining machine.  whitlock then returned to the mining machine as harvey and cassell began fueling the welder, air compressor, and pump.whitlock’s cell phone records indicate k. owens sent a text message to whitlock at 5:04 p.m. describing a loose ground lug (which can cause electrical power to be lost) he had previously encountered.  this ground lug was inside the high voltage transformer compartment.at 5:04 p.m., whitlock instructed hartley, who had remained at the substation, to re-energize the electrical power.  hartley re-energized the electrical power and asked whitlock what to do next.  whitlock said he could sit there or go home since it was close to the end of the shift.  hartley remained at the substation in his vehicle.  whitlock’s cell phone records indicate at 5:05 p.m., a message from hartley stated “turning on light switch” and at 5:10 p.m., stating “sit here a min?.”k. owens sent another text message at 5:10 p.m. stating “if you don’t see anything pretty obvious let’s set it back up and try to have nightshift running bud.”at 5:13 p.m., whitlock responded to hartley stating “yeah, just chill a few more mins then go home.” after fueling the equipment, harvey and cassell walked toward the mining machine and heard whitlock yell.  cassell went to the electronic control module (ecm) room and harvey went to the transformer compartment where he found whitlock laying inside.harvey and cassell pulled whitlock out of the transformer compartment and checked his vital signs.  cassell and harvey stated they could not find a pulse and began cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr).cassell tried to call k. owens and hartley with his cell phone to inform them of the accident, however, k. owens and hartley did not answer their phones.  cassell informed investigators that he sent text messages to k. owens and hartley at approximately 5:20 p.m.  cassell’s text to k. owens stated “call me now.”  the text sent to hartley stated “do not set power up and come to miner.”  cassell stated his phone history indicated k. owens called him back at 5:21 p.m.  at this time, cassell informed k. owens of the accident.  k. owens informed cassell he would call hartley.whitlock’s personal cell phone shows he received a text message at 5:44 p.m. from hartley stating, “headed back.”  investigators believe hartley sent this message several minutes before 5:44 p.m., but it was not received by whitlock’s cell phone when it was sent because of the loss of cell phone coverage.terry l. bird, night shift foreman and fork loader operator, stated he arrived at the mine and met hartley at the substation.  hartley was sitting in his truck and said the mining machine had lost power and he had lost cell phone service.  bird allowed hartley to use his cell phone booster.  when hartley connected his phone to the booster he received a call from k. owens informing him of the accident and instructing him to go to the mining machine.hartley locked the power out at the substation and followed bird to the mining machine.  upon arrival, hartley helped cassell and harvey with cpr.  the 911 telephone recordings indicate receiving a call at 5:40 p.m. from an unidentified individual and at 5:46 p.m. from hartley, reporting the accident.  bird stated he spoke with k. owens on the telephone, gave him the ambulance telephone number, and went to the entrance of the mine to escort the ambulance to the mining machine.the jan-care ambulance service reports indicate that two ambulances arrived on mine property at 7:00 p.m. emergency medical technicians found the victim to be non-responsive.  due to the extended time of cpr treatment (1 ½ to 2 hours) and the lack of response, cpr was discontinued per orders of dr. michael s. johnson of regional command at raleigh general hospital.  the time of death was recorded as 7:04 p.m.

senior safety coordinator, and they began the day by inspecting the rescue truck.  kuhn and ispisua went from there to perform a pit inspection and returned to the office around 7:30 a.m.  kuhn attended a safety department meeting with ispisua, mark langston, safety manager, and shane anderson, senior safety coordinator, from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. omar bernal (victim) arrived at the marigold mine at approximately 5:30 a.m. and went to the site access building. although bernal had worked at the mine before as a temporary employee, this was his first day as a marigold employee. seven additional new employees joined bernal and were escorted from security to the safety training room around 6:00 a.m. to begin in-processing.  kuhn checked in on the group’s progress periodically through the morning.  kuhn returned to the hr room around 12:30 p.m. after his safety meeting, but found the group had not completed all of their paperwork.  kuhn took a lunch break then went to the warehouse to gather personal protective equipment (ppe) for the new employees, in preparation for a tour of the mine.kuhn returned to the hr room, handed out the ppe and then he and the eight new employees got into van #1176 to begin an introductory mine tour.  around 1:40 p.m., witnesses observed the van travel around the process area and continue toward the section 20 shops and yard.at 1:12 p.m., haul truck #475 descended the section 20 ramp and started to slide. the driver was able to stop the truck using the service brakes and the berm on the left side of the road, and came to rest about 300 feet uphill from the section 20 ramp, and the lower section 29/m5 intersection (hereafter referred to as “the intersection”).  under company policy, when a driver uses the service brake at a speed over five miles per hour, the truck is secured in place until mechanics check to make sure the service brakes have not been damaged.  the haul truck was traveling over five miles per hour when the driver had to apply the service brakes, so the driver could not move the truck until a mechanic could examine the brakes.  as a result, the dispatcher suspended traffic on the section 20-ramp and larry dowd, shifter, went to the area to manage the scene.  when dowd arrived, he found the haul truck partially blocked the road.  he set up road blocks using mobile equipment - one roadblock just above the spun-out truck, and one near the intersection just below the spun-out truck.  dowd also helped the dispatcher reroute traffic and clear the pit in preparation for the blast scheduled for 2:00 p.m., while he continued to monitor the haul truck.coty munson, haul truck operator 1, was operating haul truck #481, hauling rock from the pit up to the cell 21 leach pad when the call to suspend traffic went out.  munson stopped his truck on the 29-ramp, approximately 0.4 miles downhill from the intersection.  during his interview, munson recalled dowd calling over the radio telling him to take his load back down to the bottom of the pit.  munson turned the truck around and began to return to the mackay 2 pit.   at 1:46 p.m., munson called dispatch and asked for permission to go to the cell 21 leach pad since they were clearing the pit to blast and he did not want to take his load all the way to the pit to dump.  dispatch called him back and gave him permission to go to cell 21 leach pad once the road was re-opened. munson continued to wait for the spun-out truck to be cleared.around 1:50 p.m., kuhn began to drive the van from section 20 toward the pit.  the van was allowed to pass through the first roadblock set up on 20-ramp and proceeded downhill toward the spun-out haul truck and the pit.  kuhn stopped and talked briefly to dowd, asked if everything was okay and requested permission to go into the pit so the new employees could observe the 2:00 p.m. blast.  dowd told kuhn they could go ahead and mentioned the area was congested.  dowd called the roadblock at the intersection on the radio at 1:56 p.m. and said “a white van is coming through your area, please let them through.”  kuhn drove around the spun-out haul truck, and then passed through the roadblock at the intersection of the 20-ramp and the 29-ramp.  audio recordings of radio transmissions did not contain any radio calls from the van as it approached the haul truck. the mine operator has a policy that states that all small vehicle operators must make radio contact when approaching or passing large surface mining equipment.   kuhn parked the van facing roughly south, on the right side of the haul truck.  while the van was parked, the group inside was talking.  taylor kesterson, one of the new employees, got out of the van to see if she could get a better view of the blast but returned to the van because she could not see over the berm.sometime between 1:57 p.m. and 2:04 p.m., mark kirklie, lead driller, and four passengers traveled in another van up from the pit set up a roadblock for the blast, about 100 yards, from munson’s truck (haul truck #481).    according to kirklie, both haul truck #481 and van #1176 were parked when he set the roadblock.  in his statement, kirklie said the van was parked to the right of and slightly ahead of the haul truck.  kirklie and the four other passengers in van #1119 were able to see both van #1176 and truck #481.     munson watched from the cab of his truck as kirklie set up the roadblock, approximately 100 yards in front of him.  dowd called on the radio to let the dispatcher know the road was reopened and at 2:05 p.m., the dispatcher alerted miners that haul truck #475 was cleared from the road and 29-ramp was open.  munson looked at the screen on the radio to verify the call had come from the dispatcher and since he had received permission earlier to take his load to the cell 21 leach pad, munson decided to start moving the truck.  he said he looked in his mirrors and did not see the van.  earlier, he saw a white van pass by him but did not hear anything over the radio about any other equipment near his truck.  munson honked his horn twice, put the truck into forward gear, released his brake and began to turn sharply to the right to make the u-turn to go back uphill to the cell 21 leach pad.  he applied the throttle and felt hesitation.  munson heard “481 stop, stop, stop” over the radio and immediately stopped the truck.according to interviews, the occupants inside of van #1176 saw the truck begin to move and turn toward them.  kuhn yelled at the group to get out.  interviewees stated kuhn was reaching towards the dash, trying to possibly move the vehicle or perhaps call over the radio to stop haul truck #481.  jacob jakich, who was sitting on the bench seat behind kuhn, was the first person out of the van.  he reported miners inside the van were having trouble opening the double doors on the passenger side of the van.  bernal was sitting in the front passenger seat of the van.  jakich climbed over bernal to get out of the front passenger door.  jakich opened the side doors from the outside then ran around the front of the van to try and get the driver’s (haul truck #481) attention but, was unable to do so.  the passengers in the rear of the van were able to help each other get out through the side doors, or through a side window.  bernal and kuhn did not escape before the truck ran over the front of the van.three individuals in van #1119, including kirklie, heard truck #481 honk its horn and saw it begin to turn.  kirklie yelled over the radio “481, 481 stop, 481 stop!” but was too late.  kirklie then called “mayday” over the radio and ran uphill to the accident scene to help.  when he arrived, he saw that the passengers who were able to get out of the van were not seriously hurt.  he checked the front passenger side of van #1176 and saw one person was crushed.  he quickly went to the driver’s side under the truck and found another person also was crushed. dowd arrived at the accident scene and took control.  first responders arrived and began to treat the passengers outside of the van.  alan sturtz, a passenger in the van, received a leg injury.  other than the victims, he was the only other person physically injured in the accident.  sturtz was transported to the hospital in winnemucca, nevada, for treatment.  the other six passengers of the van and the haul truck driver, munson, were taken to medical facilities in battle mountain and winnemucca, nevada and were evaluated and treated for shock. the humboldt county

LLC|Coal (Bituminous)|2017-06-19T18:26:00-04:00|Alabama|Alabama|on monday, june 19, 2017, shepherd started his shift at 3:00 p.m. as part of the evening crew.  after a safety meeting, willie edwards, evening shift foreman, gave out work assignments.  at about 3:08 p.m., locomotive operators darrell silas and derrick allen entered the mine and traveled to the no. 6 locomotive and the no. 12 locomotive.  after they conducted a pre-operational check, silas and allen drove the locomotives to the bottom of the service shaft and coupled four rail cars already loaded with supplies. the no. 6 locomotive, operated by allen, was in the lead, followed by the four supply cars and the no. 12 trailing locomotive, operated by silas.  at about 3:45 p.m., shepherd entered the mine via the service hoist and met allen and silas at the bottom of the service shaft.  shepherd asked if he could ride as a passenger in one of the locomotives to the main north 4 track, where he intended to begin his examination route along the belt entry.  investigators learned from interviews that it was common practice for examiners to ride with a locomotive crew or other vehicles traveling in and/or out of the mine on the track.at approximately 5:40 p.m., the train with shepherd aboard departed on the main north 3 track and headed inby.  shepherd was riding in the passenger seat of the no. 12 trailing locomotive with silas.  the motor crew delivered the first flat car, containing oil and shearer bits, to the 17 east section.  leaving 17 east, the train stopped at the track switch at the mouth of the section (crosscut no. 44).  shepherd disembarked from the trailing locomotive in order to throw the track switch.  he then changed his location on the train, boarding the lead locomotive and sat in the passenger seat.  the train left the switch location and continued inby on the main north 3 track.at approximately 6:25 p.m., the train reached the top of the grade on the main north 3 track and turned east onto the east main track, which has a descending grade in the direction of travel.  at crosscut no. 2, allen signaled silas to shift from first to second gear, and he did so.  the no. 6 lead locomotive has 4 transmission speeds and the no. 12 trailing locomotive has 3 transmission speeds.  when silas felt the lead locomotive pulling him, he shifted into third gear.at crosscut no. 5, silas decided that the train had gained too much speed, and he shifted back to second gear.  he locked his track sanders into the ‘continuous open’ position, which should have deposited sand onto the tracks and slowed the train.  about the same time, allen noticed the track was wet and slick.  he too began applying sand to the track using his sanders.near crosscut no. 8, allen felt his locomotive lose all traction.  he continued working his sanders and down-shifted the locomotive, but the train was soon out of control.  the train continued for 1,225 feet and, at about crosscut no. 16, shepherd was either thrown or jumped from the no. 6 locomotive.  allen and silas did not witness shepherd leaving the locomotive.traveling at an excessive speed, the train continued about 175 feet to the curve at crosscut no. 17, where the east main track turns into the main north 4 track, and it derailed.  the lead locomotive came to rest completely off the track and in a crosscut.  the ballast car and the no. 12 trailing locomotive remained on the track (see appendix b). daniel nantz, general inside laborer, was working at the east main belt tailpiece.  he heard the train wreck and went to investigate.  nantz spotted allen in the deck of the lead locomotive and asked if he was okay.  allen responded he was fine and requested nantz to check on silas and shepherd.  nantz found silas sitting in the deck of his locomotive, shaken but uninjured.  silas asked nantz if he knew where shepherd was located.  he answered, “no.”  after a quick search, nantz found shepherd in crosscut no. 16 next to an electrical distribution box.  he was unconscious and lying on his back, with his feet pointing toward the track.nantz elevated shepherd’s head and gave support to stabilize his neck.  allen arrived at the scene and used his hand-held radio to call for help.  he contacted edwards to inform him of the accident.  at approximately 6:30 p.m. edwards contacted greg cox, communication system operator, who was on the surface.  he told cox that shepherd had a head injury and needed an ambulance or possibly a medical helicopter.gary jenkins, evening shift assistant mine foreman, heard the call for help over the radio.  jenkins and his crew were in close proximity to the accident scene, so he notified edwards they would travel to the location to assist.  according to mine tracking system records, jenkins and his crew, consisting of brad kelley, general inside laborer, david barnett, belt repairman, and stephen poe, belt repairman, arrived at shepherd’s location at 6:33 p.m.  they observed that shepherd’s condition was serious.  jenkins radioed edwards to get an ambulance and hold the hoist at the bottom of the service shaft.at 6:37 p.m., jenkins and his crew placed shepherd on a track-mounted bus and began traveling toward the shaft bottom.  shepherd remained unconscious.  they placed shepherd in a stokes basket, carried him to the hoist, and arrived on the surface at 7:13 p.m.shepherd was loaded into an ambulance operated by concord fire and rescue and transported to the university of alabama at birmingham hospital.  he was pronounced dead by dr. andrew papoy, m.d., at 8:50 p.m.

there were no eyewitnesses to the accident. the following is a list of events based on the investigation, observations and interviews.  
once at the dump area, it appears flores set the park brakes on the end dump trailer and engaged the trailer’s power take-off (pto).  flores then set the revolution per minute (rpm) on the truck’s engine to approximately 1600 rpms to allow the trailer to ascend faster.  flores exited the cab wearing his hard hat, carrying his safety vest and gloves and walked alongside of the truck to pull the air valve to release the air actuated “dogs” or latches for the dump gate.  as the trailer was rising, flores apparently walked to the rear of the dump trailer and was engulfed by the sand from the trailer.
at 10:56 a.m., henry casarres, lead man, was notified by a miner that the truck and trailer had been in the same spot with the engine running and dump bed in the air for several hours. casarres went to the location of the truck.  he could not locate the driver and called robert villa, plant manager, to explain the situation. villa instructed isaaks to contact ckj trucking, the haul broker. ckj trucking manager clint de lange called flore’s cell phone which could be heard ringing in the cab of the truck. since mine employees had already searched the mine, villa instructed casarres to start digging in the dump pile behind the trailer. at approximately 11:20 a.m., casarres went to the lunch room to get shovels and the mine employees began digging. mine management called the msha dallas field office and told them they had a man missing.
at 11:43 a.m. flores was found at the bottom of the pile of dumped concrete sand and 911 was called. mine employees began first aid on flores until it was determined he had no pulse. kaufman county ems and sheriffs along with rosser volunteer fire department arrived at the scene a short time later.
the autopsy results indicated no trauma to the head or body and the cause of death was listed as mechanical asphyxia and smothering."

both miners were trapped on their backs.  clark was located underneath the operator’s compartment up to his waist with his legs extended out between the center-section and the operator’s compartment.  pate was pinned at his abdomen between the bucket and the front operator’s side tire with his legs out between the tire and bucket.  pate, who could move his arms, started flagging the travelway with his cap light trying to get the attention of anyone who might be traveling by.vernon webb, mine examiner, was traveling the main northwest travelway and noticed pate’s parked mantrip.  as webb got closer he could see a light and hear someone calling for help.  webb stopped at the crosscut and went to the side of the end loader and noticed pate underneath it.  pate asked webb to start the loader and raise it off them.  webb went to get in the operator’s compartment and noticed clark’s legs extending out from under the end loader.  as webb started the end loader, brad phillips, contract laborer, walked into the crosscut from inby.  phillips’ mantrip had gotten stuck one crosscut inby the main northwest intake shaft and he had come to where pate’s mantrip was parked to get help.  webb had phillips watch the bucket to see if he was going in the right direction as he operated the bucket tilt lever.  as webb moved the lever slowly he heard both pate and phillips yelling.  unable to hear what they were saying, he shut off the end loader.  phillips said to go the other way because the end loader was lowering onto pate.  webb started the end loader and moved the lever in the opposite direction.  this raised the end loader enough to allow pate to roll out.webb shut the end loader off and told phillips to go call for help.  phillips ran inby to a mine phone and informed mine control to call for an ambulance.  pate and webb pulled clark out from underneath the end loader.  clark was unresponsive and blue in color.  webb, who is an emergency medical technician (emt), and pate started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr).  mike hazelwood, contract laborer, arrived at the accident scene and started helping with compressions.  at this time, wilkerson had completed his trip to the longwall and returned to the area.  they placed clark on the back seat of pate’s mantrip and pate drove while webb and hazelwood continued cpr where the mine height would allow.  on the way to the main portal shaft bottom, pate told webb they were under the machine for approximately 20 minutes.  pate and webb transported clark to the surface.  clark was taken by med force ambulance service to ferrell hospital.  clark was pronounced dead by jerry watson, saline county coroner, at 2:32 p.m.  pate received contusions and bruising to his abdomen area with internal swelling.  pate was transported to harrisburg medical center where he was admitted for observation.  he was released from the hospital on wednesday, june 8, 2016."

shift supervisor the day of the accident. he discussed the day's work schedule with the dirt crew and made work assignments. hemphill assigned raymond white, excavator operator, and willie owens, haul truck driver, to excavate and haul waste from the sojourner pit, located on the southeast side of the mine property.  hemphill assigned himself, shorter and shontavius norals, haul truck driver, to work in the johnson pit, located at the northeast corner of the mine.  hemphill loaded norals's and shorter's trucks and they transported the material to the plant or waste dump, as determined load-by-load.at approximately 11:25 a.m., hemphill was loading shorter about 50 feet west of the johnson pit wall. norals was parked to the west of the loading operation waiting to be loaded. norals observed the east wall of the johnson pit begin to break and slurry and tailings (waste sand and clay) material breach the wall.  he shifted his truck into reverse and backed up the bank on the west side of the pit, before shifting into a forward gear to exit the pit, as the material engulfed the excavator and haul truck that hemphill and shorter were operating.  norals stated that the entire incident occurred in a matter of seconds.norals contacted jackie mullins, superintendent, and informed him of the failure. mullins contacted ann moore, office manager, who called 911. copiah county emergency management, sheriff's deputies, and fire and rescue arrived on scene at 11:35 a.m. rescue workers were unable to gain access to the area where the excavator and haul truck were buried in the liquefied slurry.norman ford, green brothers assistant vice president, notified msha of the accident at 11:52 a.m. central time, by telephone call to the department of labor's national contact center (dolncc). the dolncc contacted elwood ""mac"" burriss, staff assistant, south central district, dallas, tx, who issued a verbal order under the provisions of section 103(j) of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners.  msha modified the order to a section 103(k) order when the first msha inspector arrived on site.recoverymsha enforcement personnel began reviewing plans and requests for modification for the recovery efforts immediately after the accident, including approving the construction of an access road to try to reach the buried equipment.  it was determined that miners could not be reached due to the dynamic and unstable ground conditions in the area.  msha technical support dispatched its mobile emergency rescue command trailer and communications trailer as well as personnel to review ground control plans to assist in rescue and recovery efforts.  efforts to gain access to the equipment continued until almost midnight but had to be halted until additional equipment and personnel arrived to ensure safety of the rescue workers.on june 4, msha technical support arrived and began evaluating the ground conditions of the constructed roadway and failed impoundment above the recovery operations.  a large crane and decking materials arrived at the mine site and personnel began planning and evaluating conditions to set in the pit. the crane then began the process of rigging and lifting the equipment.  crane crews worked through the day to attempt to remove the equipment.on june 5, rescue workers determined there was too much material in the pit and efforts to pull the buried equipment with the crane stopped.  the operator decided to pump the material from the pit.  the plan would use onsite pumps, hoses, and pipes in an attempt to pump mud from the flooded pit to another impoundment onsite away from the accident location. later that same day, the operator decided to not utilize the pumping equipment onsite and decided to bring in other pumps and equipment and personnel to perform the work. on june 6, additional pumps and crews arrived and began running the pumps.  pumping uncovered a fair portion of the equipment and on june 7, a long reach excavator arrived onsite and was used in combination with the pumping to uncover the top of the cab of the haul truck. upon reaching the cab, search and rescue teams assisted in the search and possibly recovery of the victims.  the search and rescue teams were able to cut and remove the top of the haul unit cab. teams began digging by hand to make entry into the cab and search for mr.

cab of the excavator. rescue workers located the cab of the excavator around 3:00 p.m. and at approximately 10:00 p.m. that evening mr. hemphill was located in the cab of the excavator.  on june 9, mr. hemphill's body was recovered at 6:56 a.m.pumping continued on june 9 and 10 to remove more material from around the machines in an attempt to locate mr. shorter.  rescue crews used ground penetrating radar and cadaver dogs on june 10 to locate mr. shorter. the use of radar was unsuccessful given the material that had flooded the pit location.  crews continued to wash and pump material in the area of the truck and were able to locate mr. shorter at approximately 10:00 p.m. on june 10.  at approximately 1:30 a.m. on june 11, msha, the state search and rescue team and county officials developed a recovery plan and at approximately 7:00 a.m., workers were able to recover mr. shorter and remove him from the pit."

at approximately 2:30 p.m., b. edgington spoke in person with ross breeden, a driller for wendling, because he had not received a driller’s log reflecting the holes drilled for the blasting pattern.  breeden told edgington that there was hydraulic pressure in the blasting pattern and quite a bit of water was coming out of holes as he drilled out the blasting pattern.  at approximately 4:00 p.m., the access road into the area improved, and the jerico employees began loading the drill holes.  as they loaded the pattern, willett and norman arrived at the blast site as part of the regular inspection.  willett reviewed the blasters’ training records, inspected truck #049 and observed the loading cycle.  he left with norman to continue his inspection and the blasters continued loading holes.  l. edgington left the mine for the remainder of the day as loading continued.at approximately 6:00 p.m., willett returned to the winterset section when he saw the blasters starting to wire the holes for the upcoming blast.  he advised norman that he wanted to observe the blast.  willett, norman and hockemeier left the pit area so the blasters could tie the blast lines to the lead line.  norman and willett drove up the haul road, approximately 2,400 feet north of the blast site.  at this time, todd cook, leadman of the onsite stripping crew, contacted norman and advised him that everyone had left the mine site, including the driller, and that he was locking the gate at the mine entrance.  norman relayed cook’s comments to hockemeier.  hockemeier sounded the blasting warning siren as he drove thru the quarry.  hockemeier initially headed west from the blast site, passing nehring.  he turned north heading up the haul road and stopped approximately 1200 feet from the blast site, roughly midway between the shot and norman and willett’s location.  nehring was positioned in the blast shelter, approximately 396 feet from the blast, where he would initiate the blast.  he could not see hockemeier, norman or willett from his location.  b. edgington was positioned behind the bulk explosives truck, approximately 323 feet further west from nehring’s position (719 feet from the blast).at approximately 6:30 p.m., using a handheld radio, hockemeier called nehring to tell him it was clear to shoot.  nehring responded with a verbal radio confirmation back to hockemeier and then detonated the blast.  willett and norman were unable to hear the communications between hockemeier and nehring (the handheld radio communications were exclusively between hockemeier and nehring), but saw the blast from their position.  after the shot, nehring checked the blast area from his location and gave an all clear radio communication via the handheld radio but did not receive a response from hockemeier.  nehring radioed again that the shot was clear. at this time, b. edgington moved to nehring’s location and began retrieving items from the shot.willett and norman waited approximately 10 minutes for someone to give the all clear.  they could see hockemeier’s truck parked and could still hear the blasting warning siren.  norman and willett proceeded to hockemeier’s truck and discovered him slumped over in the cab.  a rock had penetrated the roof of the truck cab, striking him in the head.  discovering no vital signs, norman called 911 at approximately 6:39 p.m. willett proceeded to the blasters’ location to inform them of the accident and instructed them to remain in the pit area.emergency medical services arrived and confirmed that hockemeier had no vital signs.  the madison county medical examiner arrived and pronounced hockemeier dead at the scene.  the death was attributed to a blunt force injury to the head."

after arriving at the entrance to the primary sand plant, terry bolden, mine superintendent, spoke to terrell about his direction of travel on the mine roads and where he would park his truck in the area he was to be unloaded.  once the truck was staged, bolden went back to the other three delivery drivers and routed them to the south primary road.  bolden remained with the drivers while the first truck was being unloaded.at approximately 7:50 am, terrell pulled his volvo trailer truck into position at the unloading area.  the trailer load of pipe consisted of nine pipe sections arranged in three rows of three sections each.  two pipe sections in each row were banded together by the manufacturer.  five, four by four wooden timbers were placed between each row of pipe to provide stabilization.  there were chock blocks for 3 out of 5 timbers that were used to prevent the sections of pipe from rolling.  the load of pipe was secured to the trailer with sixteen, four-inch wide, nylon ratchet straps.  see attachment #1 for example
jenkins centered the jcb load-all (forklift) to the trailer and set the forks on the ground.  terrell began loosening the ratchet straps that secured the top row of pipes.  once the straps were loosened and out of the way, jenkins observed terrell standing at the front passenger side of the truck.  jenkins, using the forklift, began offloading the pipe.  he lifted two banded sections of pipe leaving a 3rd unsecured on top of the other two rows of pipe.  he lifted the banded pipe sections until they were clear of the load, put the forklift in reverse until he felt he was a good distance away from the trailer, and lowered the boom closer to the ground.as jenkins maneuvered the pipe to the staging area, he saw the 3rd unsecured pipe roll off the truck and hit the ground. bolden, who was with the other drivers, heard a pipe hit the ground.  he immediately looked at jenkins and saw banded pipe on the lift.  he then noticed that the 3rd pipe had fallen to the ground and saw a white hardhat. bolden ran to the area and saw terrell lying on his back with the pipe positioned on his chest.  bolden yelled at jenkins to drop the pipe he was transporting and bring the forklift to lift the pipe off terrell.  jenkins positioned the forks as close to terrell as possible, picked the pipe up, placed the machine in reverse, and parked it away from the truck.
bolden stated that terrell had a pulse but was unresponsive.  he then ran to his truck and called austin via cb radio, and austin contacted 911 from his cell phone at 8:37 am to report the accident.  billy gomez, safety representative, and brian hecht, safety director, arrived at the scene at approximately 8:50 am.  at that time, they determined that terrell did not have a pulse.  gomez and hecht began performing cpr on terrell until hood county ems arrived to the scene and took over.  efforts to resuscitate terrell were unsuccessful.  tarrant county medical examiner attributed cause of death as blunt force trauma of chest and abdomen due to strike by falling object."

operator, and the section crew began their shift at 8:00 a.m. they entered the mine at the marshall portal and travelled underground to the i sub-main section arriving at approximately 8:40 a.m.ray durbin, section foreman, conducted an onshift examination.  richard teets, roof bolting machine operator; max seibert, roof bolting machine operator; thomas keller, ram car operator; joseph menear, ram car operator; lonnie greenawalt, ram car operator and emergency medical technician (emt), and neice conducted pre-operational checks of their equipment. jason donaldson, compliance officer, assisted neice with the pre-operational check of the dust control parameters on the continuous mining machine.  the mine operator was conducting a respirable dust survey on this shift using a continuous personal dust monitor (cpdm).  mining began at 9:20 a.m., shortly after the examinations were completed.  teets and seibert bolted crosscut 21 between the no. 2 and no. 3 entries that was mined on the previous shift (see appendix a).  they bolted the no. 2 entry next and neice mined 27 feet in the no. 1 entry, completing an air connection between the no. 1 and no. 2 entries. neice finished mining in the no. 1 entry, trammed the continuous mining machine to the no. 6 entry and mined 27 feet.  teets and seibert trammed the roof bolting machine to the no. 1 entry and discovered that the immediate roof had fallen.  the fallen rock blocked access to the entry, and prevented the installation of roof bolts.  they reported the condition to durbin.  durbin decided to remove the rock using the continuous mining machine.  teets and seibert installed a few roof bolts as supplemental support, outby in the no. 2 entry. neice mined the no. 6 entry, the no. 5 entry, the no. 5 to no. 4 crosscut, and  the no. 4 entry.  beginning at 1:00 p.m., durbin conducted a preshift examination of the section.  durbin observed and reported “spillage” at the section feeder and in the no’s 3, 4, and 5 entries, but did not report any adverse roof or rib conditions.  durbin assigned persons to clean up the spillage.  after durbin finished his examination, neice mined in the no. 3 to no. 4 crosscut and the no. 3 entry.  after neice finished mining the no. 3 entry, durbin directed him to tram the continuous mining machine to the no. 1 entry to clean up the fallen rock.  following the clean-up of the no. 1 entry, neice trammed the continuous mining machine to the no. 2 entry.at approximately 5:20 p.m., seibert and teets began installing roof bolts in the no. 1 entry outby no. 20 crosscut.  durbin obtained an air quantity reading at the inby end of the ventilating curtain in the no. 2 entry.  neice then began mining the no. 2 entry.  neice mined the right side of the cut referred to as the “run b” (see appendix b) for a distance of approximately 27 feet. after finishing “run b”, neice positioned the continuous mining machine to begin mining the “run a” on the left side of the entry.neice had mined eighteen feet out of the “run a” when keller positioned his ram car behind the continuous mining machine to receive a load of coal.  as neice loaded the ram car, keller heard a loud “bang.”  he observed the rib rolling away from the coal block, striking neice from behind, and pinning him to the mine floor.  keller stated that neice was standing along the right side rib, approximately 5 feet inby crosscut 21 when the accident occurred.keller exited his ram car and attempted to free neice.  he was unable to move the fallen material off of neice and went to the no. 1 entry where he notified seibert and teets of the accident and requested their help.  he traveled outby and notified menear and greenawalt.  donaldson and durbin, who were located at the section power center, heard keller call for help and proceeded to the face of the no. 2 entry.seibert and teets proceeded to the accident scene and attempted to remove the rock by hand, but it was too heavy.  seibert went back to the roof bolting machine to get a slate bar for leverage.  when seibert returned to the site, he found that durbin, donaldson, greenawalt, keller and menear had arrived.  greenawalt moved his ram car out of the way, thinking a scoop may be needed to free neice.  greenawalt notified jason haskiell, scoop operator, to get the first aid supplies. seibert and teets used the slate bar to lift the rock while durbin pulled neice free. haskiell arrived with a backboard and cervical collar.  greenawalt detected a faint pulse and immediately began administering first aid.  he then secured a cervical collar around neice and placed him on the backboard.meanwhile, donaldson proceeded to the section power center and called outside to report the accident to kevin rosenberger, mine clerk. rosenberger called “ 911” at 5:54 p.m.  donaldson, then obtained a battery-powered personnel transport, and drove it toward the accident site. greenawalt, teets, and menear were carrying the victim on a back board and met donaldson just inby the section loading point.  they transferred the victim onto the transport and travelled to the section power center to retrieve the medical oxygen bottle. the group then transported the victim approximately 9,000 feet to the marshall portal.cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) was performed and oxygen was administered in route and continued until arrival on the surface at 6:23 p.m. the ambulance crew from southwest emergency medical services (ems) immediately assumed care and transported the victim to ruby memorial hospital in morgantown, west virginia, where he was pronounced dead at 7:07 p.m. by dr. rosanna sikora, attending physician.

activities.stevens began his activities by changing a throat water spray located above the conveyor on the right side of the continuous mining machine. to gain access to the throat spray from underneath the cutter drums, stevens stacked eight to ten wooden boards measuring 2"" x 8"" x 24"" with an approximate 1.75 inch diameter hole in the center of each board (pin boards) in a single column under the cutter head of the continuous mining machine.thorpe and maynard began performing maintenance on the left side of the continuous mining machine. after changing cutting bits on the cutter head, checking water pressure and water sprays on the left side of the continuous mining machine, thorpe and maynard traveled to the right side of the continuous mining machine at approximately 1:40 a.m. to assist stevens with changing a load locking valve on the cutter head jack located on the left side (operator's side) of the machine. stevens noticed the cutter head was still slowly falling after he changed the load locking valve on the right side of the head jack the previous night.thorpe leaned in from the operator's side of the continuous mining machine between the raised cutter head boom and the pan and removed the load locking valve. a sketch of the accident scene is shown in appendix b. thorpe then waited beside the continuous mining machine while stevens retrieved a new load locking valve. with the replacement valve in hand, thorpe leaned back underneath the cutter head boom into the pan of the continuous mining machine at approximately 2:00 a.m. to install the new device. at that time, stevens was standing next to thorpe on the operator's side of the continuous mining machine and maynard was standing in front of the cutter head of the machine. both miners stated there was a loud popping noise and then the cutter head boom dropped onto the victim, crushing him between the pan and cutter head boom of the continuous mining machine.stevens tried to pull thorpe out from under the cutter head boom but was unable to retrieve him. stevens then started the continuous mining machine and tried to lift the cutter head boom off of the pan with the remote box, but was unsuccessful because the hydraulic fluid needed to raise the cutter head boom was exiting through the port where the load locking valve was to be installed. stevens then sent maynard to get help. maynard went to kyle smith, no.1 unit lead man, and told him of the accident. smith was operating a battery-powered scoop in no.3 entry at the time. smith took the battery-powered scoop to the continuous mining machine and attempted to lift the cutter head boom in order to free the victim. the battery-powered scoop could not lift the cutter head boom because it was too heavy. smith then went and retrieved a battery-powered ram car and attempted to lift the cutter head boom, but this too was unsuccessful.in the meantime, chris woodall, third shift mine examiner and mine emergency technician, was informed by steve edmonds, carbon monoxide monitor technician, of the accident. woodall then contacted larry offutt, third shift mine foreman, at 2:20 a.m. to inform him of the accident and to request an ambulance. offutt informed charles campbell, outside dispatcher, of the accident at 2:25 a.m. and instructed him to get an ambulance in route and to call msha and the kentucky division of mine safety (kdms). chad locke, belt mechanic, heard on the radio that someone was hurt and needed the diesel scoop on the no.1 unit. locke trammed the dapco diesel scoop to the no.1 unit to assist in raising the cutter head boom. the dapco diesel scoop was unsuccessful because the cutter head boom was too heavy. offutt then contacted jacob johnson, outby utility worker, who was hauling rock dust and instructed him to go to the 3rd 54 belt header and get the eimco diesel scoop and take it to the no.1 unit.offutt then informed campbell to contact air evac life services for assistance and the webster county coroner.johnson arrived on the no.1 unit at around 3:00 a.m. he attempted to lift the cutter head boom with the eimco duckbill, but was unsuccessful. it was then decided to apply down pressure on the duckbill and block under the wheels of the scoop for extra leverage. the eimco scoop was able to reach farther under the cutter head boom to allow more lifting leverage, by wedging between the ripper head and the continuous mining machine's pan line. when the operator pushed the scoop bucket down and articulated the scoop, it pushed the continuous mining machine's pan down into the soft mine floor and raised the cutter head boom allowing enough clearance to retrieve thorpe at 3:24 a.m.the victim was placed on a back board by offutt, woodall, willis jerrell, outby utility man; robert alvey, belt mechanic; and kolten cullen, member of belt crew, to be transported out of the mine by offutt and james poe, (met). at 4:01 a.m., thorpe arrived on the surface and was moved to the webster county emergency medical services ambulance. the webster county coroner, who was on site, determined that the victim died instantly when the accident occurred at 2:00 a.m. "

morris, whitley, and swain entered the mine at approximately 3:00 p.m. and traveled to the 5th left construction area.  they worked the first part of the shift gathering equipment and supplies needed to install the temporary belt drive.  due to the size of the complete belt drive unit, the discharge boom was disconnected from the belt drive frame to make it easier to move.
the parts of the belt drive were moved into the belt entry near where the unit was to be installed.  the discharge boom was reconnected to the belt drive frame at the hinge point.  a 3-ton chain hoist was then used to raise the discharge roller end of the boom so the screw jacks could be installed.
whitley was working on the south side of the discharge boom and swain was working directly under the boom trying to get the hole in the screw jack to line up with the hole in the belt drive frame so they could install the pins to hold the boom in place.  at approximately 8:45 p.m., the chain hangers holding the chain hoist pulled out of the mine roof, due to the weight of the discharge boom, allowing it to suddenly drop and strike swain on the left shoulder and neck area.
at the accident site, swain was attended to by mine personnel and then taken outside by morris.  he was transported to a local hospital emergency room by jan conci, safety technician, for treatment.  swain was released from the emergency room with an appointment to follow up with an orthopedic specialist for the pain in his left shoulder.  he also was excused from work due to his injury.
on october 1, 2015, while off work due to his shoulder injury, swain attended a public event with his wife.  he became ill and complained of shortness of breath.  swain’s wife called 911 and an ambulance transported him to st. joseph memorial hospital in murphysboro, illinois.  while in transit to the hospital, swain went into cardiac arrest.  resuscitative measures were started and continued after the ambulance arrived at the emergency room.  swain was pronounced dead by douglas frankel, md at 7:25 p.m."

big creek shop no. 1.  r. mullins, victim, and another truck driver, doug taylor, arrived at approximately 5:30 a.m. in trucks driven from off-site.  all trucks departed the shop at approximately 6:00 a.m. and arrived at the piney branch mine, located in buchanan county, virginia, at approximately 7:20 a.m.  their work assignment consisted of transporting the highwall mining machine from the piney branch surface mine to the apex no.11 surface mine.  the first truck was loaded with the cab reel and highwall miner cab.  the next truck, driven by r. mullins, was loaded with the base power module (bpm).  these two trucks departed the mine site at approximately 10:30 a.m. and traveled to the apex mine, arriving at approximately 11:30 a.m.  four other trucks departed at approximately 11:30 a.m. and arrived between 12:15 and 12:30 p.m. at the mine.  the truck drivers and equipment they were hauling are listed below in order of departure from the piney branch mine: the first truck to arrive at the mine was driven by sammons.  he transported his load to the elkhorn no. 2 seam level without any assistance.  the next truck to arrive at the mine was driven by r. mullins.  while traveling up the haul road, the vehicle stalled in a left-hand curve just below the equipment parking lot.  he contacted everette crawford, mine foreman for apex energy, via cell phone to ask for assistance.  crawford responded that he would send someone to help.  crawford then went to get c. mullins (the brother of r. mullins), who was operating an excavator to develop access for future mining at the williamson coal seam level.crawford took c. mullins to the equipment parking lot to get the grader.  c. mullins conducted a pre-operational examination on the grader and then drove the grader to assist r. mullins.  r. mullins indicated to c. mullins that he needed assistance due to the weight of the bpm shifting to the left side of the trailer, causing loss of traction.  one end of a 10-foot chain was attached to the rear of the grader and the other end to the front of the mack granite truck.  c. mullins then towed r. mullins’s truck (approximately 150 feet) to a flat area near the equipment parking lot and unhooked the chain from the front of the truck.  c. mullins traveled ahead of r. mullins up the slope to the next steep road incline, just below the elkhorn no. 2 seam bench and waited.c. mullins observed r. mullins attempting to ascend the steep incline.  r. mullins was only able to ascend the steep incline approximately 207 feet before having to back down to a point near the bottom.  r. mullins’s truck was positioned on approximately a 12% incline just above the level area.  as c. mullins was backing the grader down the slope, r. mullins was standing beside the passenger side of his truck waiting to perform the hook-up for towing.  after positioning the grader within a few feet of the front of the truck, c. mullins lowered the grader blade and set the park brake.  r. mullins attempted to attach the chain to the tow hook of the truck, but the chain wouldn’t reach.  r. mullins stepped back off to the side of the grader and motioned for c. mullins to come back further.  c. mullins released the park brake and raised the grader blade up slightly to let the grader roll back in neutral while applying the service brake and the clutch brake (d-brake).while c. mullins held the grader stationary with both the service foot brake and clutch brake (d-brake) applied, r. mullins stepped back in between the rear of the grader and the front of the truck to attach the chain.  after about 4 or 5 seconds, the low air pressure alarm sounded and the grader rolled backward while c. mullins applied both service brakes.  after realizing the grader had made contact with the front of the truck, c. mullins exited the left side of the grader and observed r. mullins pinned between the grader and truck.  c. mullins re-entered the cab of the grader and pulled forward a couple of feet and set the park brake.  the low air pressure alarm was still sounding while he pulled forward.  c. mullins returned to r. mullins and checked for a pulse but got no response.  c. mullins then called crawford for help.  c. mullins stayed with r. mullins, while crawford went to get neal anders, c. w. augering superintendent, for assistance.  crawford and anders returned with the met (mine emergency technician’s kit) but were unable to administer medical treatment due to the nature of the injury.the first emergency responder from the phelps fire department received a call at 12:02 p.m. and arrived at 12:21 p.m.  the safety director for apex energy had called the mine office and instructed the secretary to call 911.  trans-star ambulance service arrived at 12:35 p.m., and transported c. mullins to pikeville medical center for emotional trauma and distress related to the accident.  russell roberts, pike county coroner, pronounced r. mullins dead at the scene of the accident at 1:35 p.m.

no. 4 face at 4:35 a.m. dates, times and initials were not found in the no. 5 through no. 7 faces.the sequence of time indicates brummitte traveled through the last open crosscut to the no. 4 entry when traveling from the no. 3 to no. 4 face. jerry kelly, scoop operator, stated brummitte flagged him down in the no. 5 entry outby the last open crosscut and borrowed the slate bar which is normally maintained on the scoop kelly was operating. the emergency response plan (erp) tracking system records show brummitte and kelly were together in an area of the no. 7 entry at 4:51 a.m.the tracking system shows brummitte returned to the no. 4 entry at 5:00 a.m. the tracking records indicate brummitte remained in this general area until stewart found him trapped by the rib fall. it has been determined the accident occurred at approximately 5:00 a.m.stewart was walking in the no. 4 entry toward the shuttle car with the intention of moving the shuttle car outby, toward the dump point, to clear a trailing cable overlap. stewart stated that as he approached the shuttle car, he saw brummitte’s hard hat and light on the mine floor near the rear of the shuttle car and immediately knew there was a problem. based on interviews and a review of the employee tracking records, stewart arrived at brummitte’s location at approximately 5:10 a.m.stewart immediately summoned help from kelly and mike shelton, outby foreman, who were in the area. kelly and shelton had been working with stewart to move the continuous mining machine and were approximately one crosscut from the accident scene. daniel bowen and mike shell, outby laborers, were working on the section conveyor belt tailpiece approximately two crosscuts outby the accident scene. they ran to the accident scene to assist once they were informed of the accident. the miners attempted to free brummitte using their hands and two slate bars to lift the fallen rib material, but were unsuccessful. brummitte was trapped in a semi-upright position between the shuttle car and the fallen rib, facing toward the no. 3 entry. shelton ran to the dump point, then trammed a mini-trac fork lift to the accident site and used it to lift the rib fall, allowing the other miners to pull brummitte free and begin first aid.as brummitte was freed from the rib fall, donald cook, maintenance foreman, arrived at the accident site and cook and bowen immediately began cardio pulmonary resuscitation (cpr). stewart traveled to the power center and retrieved first aid supplies. billy mullins, scoop operator, transported the supplies to the accident site. stewart retrieved an automatic external defibrillator (aed) from the power center, which was administered immediately. shell radioed outside and informed shane meade, section foreman, of the accident and the need for emergency rescue assistance. kenneth webb, assistant shift foreman, overheard the conversation and alerted surface personnel to also initiate med-flight. webb was on the 001-0 mmu when he was informed of the accident. he immediately traveled by mantrip to the 003-0 mmu to assist.cook and bowen, who administered first aid to burmmitte, indicated that no pulse or breathing was detected during the treatment. they also indicated that the aed only gave a command to shock one time. the shock did not produce a detectable pulse. cook, bowen, shell and shelton worked briefly to prepare brummitte for transport to the surface. brummitte was stabilized on a back board and transported via mantrip to the surface of the mine. webb, shell, shelton, bowen and mike gamble, maintenance foreman, traveled with brummitte to the surface. shelton operated the mantrip as the other miners administered cpr with aed monitoring during the trip to the surface. they arrived on the surface at approximately 5:39 a.m. and continued resuscitation efforts until brummitte was transferred to the med-flight personnel.med-flight personnel, along with brummitte, boarded a ground unit rescue vehicle operated by clintwood volunteer rescue squad, inc. the victim was transported to dickenson county community hospital, clintwood, virginia, and arrived at 6:36 a.m. he was pronounced dead by dr. craig graul, emergency room physician, at 6:47 a.m., on march 16, 2015.

mize; adam cox,  highwall mining machine operator; mark sexton, groundman; steve osborne, utility man; chris newman, forklift operator; johnathan newsome, loader operator; and larry partin, welder.  the entire crew started by adding seven to eight more push beams before finishing this production cycle.  the push beams for the highwall mining machine are 20 feet in length and contain dual auger conveyors which transfer the coal mined by the cutting head to the surface. upon completion of the #659 opening, the push beam and the cutter-head were retracted out of the opening.between 9:00 and 9:30 a.m., the highwall mining machine was moved over to mine the #660 opening.  this opening was mined approximately 400 feet deep.  the highwall mining machine operator then retracted the push beams and the cutter-head out of the opening at approximately 3:00 p.m.  the entire crew serviced the mining machine, set bits, and greased and adjusted the cutter-head chains in preparation to start the #661 opening.at approximately 3:30 p.m., the #661 opening was started and mining had advanced approximately 70 feet when cornett, who was operating the highwall mining machine, informed the crew that the right side motor had stopped cutting and the push beams and cutter-head would have to be retreated from the underground opening.  when the highwall mining machine was out of the opening, the crew noticed the right side cutter-head chain was missing. newsome, cornett, a. cox, newman, and sexton gathered at the face of the opening.  utilizing a light, they saw the cutter-head chain lying near the right rib approximately 37 feet into the opening.  they discussed how to retrieve the chain from the mine opening.  cornett asked a. cox if he was going in the opening to retrieve the chain.  a. cox refused to go, but he told cornett that mize would go into the opening to connect to the chain so it could be removed from the opening.  while standing at the face of the opening, cornett, newsome, newman, and sexton were examining the roof when mize stated to cornett, newsome, newman, and sexton that he would go into the opening to retrieve the chain.  newsome, newman, and sexton insisted that the roof was too bad to go into the opening, but mize remained firm that he could retrieve the chain.  foreman cornett and mize told sexton to find something that mize could take into the unsupported opening to connect to the chain so that the chain could be pulled outside.  sexton obtained a chain and straps from a truck nearby.  cornett and mize tied and taped the chain and straps together and cornett instructed sexton to get the loader and have it ready while mize entered the opening.cornett was standing at the entrance of the opening when mize entered the highwall mining machine opening.  during the accident investigation interviews, no witness recalled cornett taking any action to prohibit mize from entering the unsupported highwall mining machine opening.  approximately ten to fifteen seconds after mize entered the opening, cornett heard the roof fall.  cornett shouted out to mize, but received no response.  cornett traveled into the opening to check on mize and found that he was covered by the roof fall.  cornett exited the opening and told a. cox, newsome, newman, and sexton that mize was covered up and he needed their help to get him out.  cornett instructed them to gather crib blocks, hammers, and a slate bar to help free mize from the rock.  a. cox, newsome, and sexton immediately dispersed to collect the materials while cornett called 911.  cornett instructed newman to meet the ambulance at the bottom of the hill.  newsome was fearful and refused to enter the opening.  cornett, a. cox, and sexton entered the opening in an attempt to rescue mize.  after reaching mize’s location, they shouted outside and advised newsome that they needed more crib blocks and a pneumatic jack to free mize from beneath the rock.  sexton observed the roof of the opening as a. cox and cornett worked to free mize from the fall and bring him outside.  newsome retrieved the materials including a mine emergency technician bag and medical supplies and placed them near the opening for use when mize was brought outside.cornett and a. cox recovered mize from beneath the rock and brought him outside from the mine opening.  mize was unresponsive and the crew immediately began cpr.  the bell country ambulance service arrived at 5:20 p.m., assumed care of mize and subsequently transported him to pineville community hospital.  he was later transported onto a helicopter to be air lifted to holston valley medical center in kingsport, tennessee.  shortly after leaving the landing zone, mize went into cardiac arrest and the flight paramedics were unable to resuscitate him.  the flight crew immediately returned to the landing zone of the pineville community hospital where mize was pronounced dead at 9:36 p.m. by bell county coroner, jay steele.

Inc|Coal (Bituminous)|2014-08-20T10:55:00-04:00|Virginia|Virginia|on august 20, 2014, the mine was conducting normal mining operations.  coal production started on the 24 right super section (013 and 014 mmus) on the midnight shift and continued into the day shift.  the 24 right day shift crew arrived on the section at approximately 8:20 a.m.  rick koger, section electrician, started his daily routine of placing calibration gas on the methane monitor for the right side continuous mining machine.  koger then went to the right side roof bolting machine located in the no. 3 entry inby survey station no. 31596 to test the methane sensors on the roof bolting machine.  the roof bolting machines at this mine are equipped with a methane monitor that has dual sensors; one sensor is located underneath each operator’s drill canopy.  according to koger, both the right side continuous mining machine and the right side roof bolting machine functioned properly when calibration gas was applied to the methane monitor sensors.  after he completed the checks on the roof bolting machine, koger started to walk away.  one of the roof bolting machine operators called for him to come back.  koger was told that the roof bolting machine would not start.  koger started troubleshooting the roof bolting machine.  koger stated that he took the cover off the largest explosion proof enclosure (see appendix a) on the roof bolting machine in order to troubleshoot the electrical circuits.  koger found a blown fuse and a broken resistor wire.  he determined that the blown fuse and broken resistor wire did not correct the startup problem.  at no time did koger or anyone else deenergize the power for this roof bolting machine at the power center.some outby maintenance supervisors are also assigned to oversee a mining section as part of their normal duties.  those maintenance supervisors travel to the sections on a regular basis to assist the section electricians.  justice, a maintenance supervisor, was assigned to the 24 right section (see appendix b).  on the day of the accident, justice traveled to the section as part of his normal duties.  justice entered the mine at approximately 7:52 a.m.  he walked to the maintenance area and traveled by diesel powered man bus (track) to the 24 right section.  justice arrived on the section at approximately 9:20 a.m.  when justice arrived on the section, he learned that the roof bolting machine was not operating.  justice traveled the no. 3 entry to the right side roof bolting machine to assist koger with troubleshooting and electrical work on the roof bolting machine.  koger told justice what he had done and they both discussed the next steps to be taken.  justice then directed koger to get an is relay from the parts sled for the emergency stop circuit.at this time, justice performed electrical work, instead of troubleshooting, when the is relay was removed and a new relay was installed.  after replacing the is relay, it was determined that the relay was not the problem.  justice instructed koger to go to the methane monitor power supply and open the electrical enclosure for further troubleshooting.  the methane monitor power supply electrical enclosure was located in the center toward the front of the walk-through roof bolting machine.  at some point, justice placed the circuit breaker, which was inside the largest explosion proof enclosure of the roof bolting machine, in the “off” position and replaced the is relay with the original relay he had taken out earlier (see appendix c).it is believed that justice was trying to put the relay retainer bands in place when he came into contact with the loose strands of the red phase lead or the connection lug on the line side of the breaker.  this contact put 346 vac from the tip of his left hand ring finger through his body to ground.  the 346 vac is the phase-to-ground voltage of a 600 vac three-phase circuit.koger walked to the methane monitor power supply and was preparing to remove the cover of the electrical enclosure.  he heard justice make a noise.  koger stated he turned and ran out of the walkway to the back of the roof bolting machine and observed that justice appeared to be in contact with an energized electrical circuit.  according to koger, justice was on his knees and appeared to have both hands inside the panel board of the roof bolting machine.  koger ran to justice and kicked him, to knock him away from the energized circuit of the roof bolting machine.  koger stated that when kicked, justice was not knocked away from the machine, but koger believed that justice had been freed from the energized circuit.  koger then grabbed justice by the shoulders and pulled him to the ground.  koger stated that he did not feel an electrical shock when he grabbed justice.greg burress, roof bolting machine operator, was also near the roof bolting machine when the accident happened.  burress yelled for help.  terry hamilton, section foreman, and luke stull, geologist, were located just outby the roof bolting machine in the intersection and heard burress.  hamilton came to the accident scene and started first aid.  tim laforce, continuous miner coordinator, was notified of the accident by stull, and they arrived at the scene shortly after hamilton.  burress left to get first aid supplies.  todd keen, roof bolting machine operator, went to the mine phone to request an ambulance.  on his way back to the accident scene, keen met roby thomas, left side continuous mining machine operator, with the automatic external defibrillator (aed).  keen took the aed to the accident scene.  while first aid was being rendered, the aed was placed on justice.  the aed recommended one shock, which was given.  the aed did not recommend any further shocks.  jackie horn, right side continuous mining machine operator, burress, laforce, and keen continued administering first aid.  daniel smith, roof bolting machine operator, went to obtain track clearance and prepare a man bus to transport the victim to the surface.  laforce instructed hamilton to go to the mine phone at the power center, notify management,   and make sure the track was clear from the 24 right section to the horn mountain shaft bottom.  hamilton met anthony cook, scoop operator, and directed him to make sure the roadway between the no. 3 entry and the supply hole was clear and to take the scoop to the no. 3 entry where the victim was located.  justice was secured on a backboard, loaded into the bucket of the scoop, and transported to the man bus.  justice was then transported on the man bus to the horn mountain shaft bottom.  laforce, keen, burress, and horn continued performing cpr on the victim during transport while smith operated the man bus. mercy ambulance service was notified of the accident at approximately 10:29 a.m.  the ambulance arrived at the mine site at approximately 10:55 a.m.  at approximately 11:20 a.m., the man trip arrived on the shaft bottom with justice and the emts from the ambulance service took over resuscitation efforts.  they continued cpr and transferred justice to the top of the shaft and into the ambulance.  they left the mine at approximately 11:53 a.m. and transported justice to clinch valley medical center, richlands, virginia, arriving at approximately 12:16 p.m.  the emergency room physician, dr. ben kerny, pronounced michael justice dead at 12:29 p.m.

after shift change, wells started the crusher system and belt conveyors.  wells then took the caterpillar d9 bulldozer to the raw scoria pile to push material to wishard who was operating the caterpillar 336d excavator (backhoe) to load the material into the feeder hopper.
at approximately 4:30 a.m., on june 4, 2014, wells noticed a large scoria rock, 38”x 36”x 25” lodged in the feeder (see appendix a, photo 3).  wells processed the raw material through the system to clear the crusher and belt conveyors in preparation to remove the large rock.  wells shut the system down in sequence and locked out and tagged the electrical power to the machine.  wells then positioned the caterpillar 330 excavator on the right side of the crusher and put the bucket of the excavator in the feeder so wishard could attach the metal chokers and nylon straps/slings in the first attempt to remove the rock from the feeder (see appendix a, photo 4).  during the first attempt, the rock slipped out of the rigging through the feeder opening into the crusher hopper.
after the failed attempt, the locks were removed and power to the crusher was restored.  the upper frame of the crusher was raised and the left safety arm was set on its pin to hold the upper frame in the open position.  the right safety arm was damaged sometime prior to this work shift, and was not secured on the right side.  the crusher was once again locked out, and the same process was used to attempt to remove the rock from the crusher.  the second attempt was successful.  wells lifted the rock out of the crusher, backed the excavator up, and set the rock on the ground.  wells exited the 330 excavator to remove the sling basket from the rock and take his lock and tag off the crusher. wells then moved the 330 excavator from the crusher to the fuel storage area, and started to refuel it. 
while wells was moving the excavator, wishard removed his lock and tag and started the diesel engine.  wishard then raised the upper frame of the crusher off the left safety arm and removed the safety arm from its support position to allow the upper frame to return to its normal position.  for an unknown reason, wishard positioned his body between the lower frame of the crusher and the raised upper frame (see appendix a, photo 5).  while wishard was leaning over the lower frame, the upper frame slowly moved down, fatally crushing wishard.
wells left the fuel area and returned to see if wishard needed help.  wells saw wishard had been pinched between the upper and lower frame of the crusher.  wells lifted the upper frame, set the left safety arm, shut off and locked the diesel motor, then called for help at 5:40 a.m. 
the mine dispatch announced an emergency on the mine site and then called county emergency services at 5:41 a.m.  surface mine emergency team (smet) members nick mcgraw and darrin cope arrived at the accident location at 5:48 a.m. and smet members jake miller and maria kautz arrived shortly thereafter.  mcgraw and cope found wishard between the crusher frames.  smet members removed wishard, started cpr, and attempted the use of an automated external defribrillator (aed).  the aed advised “no shock” for the victim.  wishard was placed into the mine ambulance and it exited the mine at 6:06 a.m.  chad reid and denny bohne, emt paramedics who were in the campbell county ambulance, met the mine ambulance on the access road.  reid and bohne left their ambulance and entered the mine ambulance.  the mine ambulance resumed travel to campbell county memorial hospital.  wishard was pronounced dead at 6:22 am by dr. johnathan hayden."

and the automated temporary roof support (atrs) structure. payne was found with his head pointing inby and his legs pointing outby. see appendix a for a drawing of the accident scene.fuller found payne to be unresponsive with no detectable pulse or respiration and immediately started cpr. fuller continued cpr until he was exhausted. at 2:50 p.m., he stopped cpr to look for help or a mine telephone to call for help. between approximately 2:50 p.m. and 3:20 p.m., fuller left the victim twice to look for help or an operable telephone. each time fuller left the victim he returned and resumed cpr, but fuller did not locate any other personnel or find an operational mine telephone.after 3:20 p.m., fuller finally encountered another miner in the no. 3 entry inby the accident scene. michael pribble, roof bolting machine operator, was stopped on a tractor at no. 101 crosscut when he saw fuller’s cap light flashing outby his location. fuller ran to pribble’s location and informed him of the accident. fuller returned to the victim. pribble called to report the accident and mike lilly, mine manager, responded. lilly was near the viking longwall district 1 headgate #1. pribble reported that payne had been injured by a roof bolting machine, was unresponsive, and was located at the no. 87 crosscut on the viking tg 1 in the no. 3 entry. it was learned during the accident investigation that the no. 87 crosscut, which had been reported as the accident location, was inaccurate. lilly called shawn stacy, who was inby the accident scene on the viking tg 1, and directed him to go to the accident scene. lilly called safety director, girolamo antravaia, who was on the surface of the mine, and informed him of the accident and that the victim was unresponsive.after talking with pribble, fuller returned to the accident scene and restarted cpr on payne again. stacy arrived at the accident scene a short time after pribble had reported the accident and took over cpr. stacy checked vital signs and found payne unresponsive with no detectable pulse or respiration.at approximately 3:20 p.m., antravaia and joshua huth, viking portal longwall coordinator, entered the mine at the viking portal and traveled by truck to the accident scene, arriving at approximately 3:45 p.m. stacy was performing cpr on payne. antravaia assessed payne’s vital signs. payne was still unresponsive with no detectable pulse or respiration. antravaia took over the cpr activities from stacy. payne was transported from the accident scene to the viking portal shaft bottom by truck.payne was brought to the surface at approximately 3:50 p.m. abbott emergency services (ems) transported the victim to the franklin county hospital in benton, illinois. at 4:12 p.m., payne was pronounced dead by dr. charles buckley at the franklin county hospital emergency room.

immediately before the accident, scroggins used the bucket of the excavator to lower the top bowl into the body of the crusher.  shaffer was below the crusher putting the oil plug into the bottom of the cone crusher and schmidt was above making sure the bowl was placed properly.  the bowl was in place and had been disconnected from the excavator bucket.  schmidt gave scroggins directions, but he did not understand them.  scroggins said that he disengaged the hydraulics using the lock-out lever, got up, and began to exit the cab of the excavator.  as he exited the cab, he inadvertently hit the swing arm lever, causing the hydraulics to reengage and the bucket to swing toward schmidt. schmidt was standing with one foot on the crusher drive belt guard and the other on the cone.  as the bucket swung, it struck schmidt in the side, causing him to fall forward off of the crusher.  he fell approximately 11 feet to the ground, landing on his head and shoulder.  shaffer and scroggins saw schmidt fall and immediately went to his aid.  an ambulance was summoned and schmidt was transported to the hospital.schmidt suffered severe injuries, including a broken collar bone, a broken neck, a broken back, two broken legs, and broken ribs.  after spending several months in the hospital, he was moved to a rehabilitation facility.  he was released from the rehabilitation facility in mid-april 2015, but had to return, because a foot wound was not healing properly.  schmidt went into acute respiratory distress, and was transported to the hospital where he died on may 26, 2015."

Virginia|Coal|Patriot Coal Corporation|Coal (Bituminous)|2014-05-12T20:30:00-04:00|WestVirginia|WestVirginia|"on monday, may 12, 2014, at the start of the evening shift, a safety meeting was conducted with miners on the no. 1 section.  during the safety meeting, an accident that occurred on the section on the previous friday, may 9, 2014, was discussed with the section crew and described as a “rib roll.”   because of this accident, additional safety precautions were suggested and passed on to the crew by bobby moore, section foreman,  the additional safety measures suggested by mine management consisted of setting rib timbers on the right side of the entry and for the continuous mining machine operator to position himself away from the machine as far as possible.  the accident investigation interviews revealed that several members of the crew stated they had voiced concerns during the safety meeting.  the miners believed that the suggested rib timbers were inadequate for the adverse rib conditions encountered previously.  rib timbers are typically used as a means of roof support for wide areas and are not an accepted prudent engineering practice to provide protection from rib rolls.the evening shift section crew arrived on the no. 1 section at approximately 3:55 p.m. and started retreat mining operations in the no. 5 entry.  the previous crew had completed setting rib timbers along the right side of the entries, in the nos. 6, 7, and 8 entries.  the pre-shift examination report for the section indicated that no hazards were observed in these entries.  after completing retreat mining in the no. 5 entry, the mobile roof support (mrs) units were moved by hensley and the continuous mining machine was moved by legg to no. 6 entry to begin retreat mining.  the first left lift and the first right lift were mined successfully.  at approximately 8:15 p.m., while mining the second left lift from the pillar between the nos. 5 and 6 entries, a large violent and sudden pillar burst (bump) occurred, causing fatal injuries to legg and hensley. the primary cause of the pillar burst was a highly stressed coal pillar located between nos. 6 and 7 entries.  legg and hensley would likely have had their backs toward this pillar while they were engaged in mining the second left lift.  the original entry height in the no. 6 entry was estimated to be approximately 78 inches and approximately 20 feet in width.  after the burst, this entry was filled with loose coal to within 30 inches of the mine roof and the estimated entry height had been reduced to 66 inches due to convergence of the mine roof and mine floor. during the accident investigation interviews, miners and personnel at the mine referred to the pillar burst as a “bump.” according to the interviews, the pillar burst also caused a large amount of dust to be suspended in the mine air, making visibility very difficult for several minutes after the event.  as a result of the burst, the pillar located between nos. 6 and 7 entries contained a large gap between the coal and the mine roof of an undetermined width and depth.  the immediate mine roof in this area consisted of sandstone that contained only minor cracks and the roof strata in the area remained intact after the pillar burst.  no roof fall was associated with this event.prior to the accident, mike shull, section electrician, was standing approximately 55 feet outby the continuous mining machine near the mrs units in the last open cross cut of the no. 6 entry.  he observed legg and hensley working at the continuous mining machine and was supposed to help them move the continuous mining machine cable, when a shuttle car being driven by bazzil goodman approached the area.  as the shuttle car approached, shull stepped back into the crosscut to get out of the way.  at that time, the pillar burst occurred.  shull stated that the force of the burst was so strong that shull’s chest was hurt and he was nearly knocked down.  the only thing that prevented shull from being knocked down was that he grabbed the mrs cables hanging near where he was standing.  shull was the closest miner to the accident scene and was the first person to respond.  shull stated that the entire entry was immediately filled with dust and he could not see for several minutes.  when the dust initially cleared, shull still could not see the continuous mining machine because the entry was filled with coal.  shull started yelling for legg and hensley, but received no response.  shull used his hand-held radio to call for help and assistance, stating that they had “two guys covered up and that they needed help.” goodman and todd agosti, shuttle car operators, arrived at the accident scene.  shull told goodman to go and find bobby moore, section foreman, for assistance and guidance.  shull and agosti tried again to look up the no. 6 entry.  as the dust cleared, they could see the lights on the top of the mrs units.  shull noticed that the continuous mining machine’s cable had been forced over top of the machine’s conveyor boom. at the time of the accident, moore and jackie bailey, roof bolting machine operator, were standing near the backup curtains in the no. 3 entry.  when the pillar burst occurred, they reported hearing the burst, feeling the vibration from it, and noticed dust filling the air.  immediately after the pillar burst, moore and bailey started running toward the location of the continuous mining machine in the no. 6 entry.  moore and bailey encountered goodman.  goodman and moore discussed the accident briefly, while bailey proceeded on to the accident scene.  goodman and moore followed shortly thereafter. bailey stated that when he arrived at the accident scene, the area experienced a “second bump,” which again caused dust to be suspended into the air surrounding the accident scene.  the second “bump,” as described in interviews, caused the uninjured miners near the accident location to move outby in the no. 6 entry. moore arrived near the accident scene in the no. 6 entry and proceeded to the section mine phone and called outside for joey athey, operations manager, for assistance.  shortly after this second event, shull, bailey, agosti, goodman, and moore, returned to the accident scene and discovered that they had verbal communications with hensley.  moore went back to the mine phone and called outside to inform athey that they had communications with one of the miners involved in the accident. moore returned to the accident scene and had the two outby mrs units moved to the edge of the crosscut nearest the no. 6 entry in order to provide additional roof support to the affected area of the accident.  moore took the section battery scoop and started removing the ejected coal from the no. 6 entry to provide additional clearance for access to the trapped miners.jeremy buskirk, outby laborer and an experienced first responder with a local volunteer fire department, was working near the no. 2 section.  buskirk learned of the accident and went to the no. 1 section where he spoke to shull at the section mine phone.  buskirk proceeded to the accident scene where he observed the area behind the continuous mining machine was filled with coal.  moore was still removing the loose, ejected coal and debris with the battery scoop.  buskirk could hear someone calling for help near the continuous mining machine.  buskirk stopped moore from using the battery scoop to remove any additional loose coal.  buskirk feared they could cause additional injuries to the victims because they did not know their exact location.  when moore stopped the battery scoop, they could hear hensley shouting for help again.moore, agosti, buskirk, bailey, and goodman crawled over the ejected coal to the back of the continuous mining machine. they crawled single file, with moore leading, due to the restricted room to maneuver in the entry.  they found legg and hensley laying near the machine, with hensley under the conveyor boom and legg at the cable standoff near the back of the machine.  moore proceeded to legg, who was further inby, and pulled him away from the cable standoff.  legg was found to be unresponsive and no pulse was detected. 
  
moore then turned to help hensley, who was shouting for them to get him out.  moore, agosti, buskirk, bailey, and goodman started to uncover and dig out the material around hensley, using their hands and trying to pull him free.  moore realized there was still electrical power on the continuous mining machine and hensley was pinned from just below his chest by the machine’s conveyor boom.  moore retrieved the continuous mining machine’s remote control unit, which was with legg, and connected it to goodman’s battery light in order to get power for the unit.  moore used the remote control unit to move the continuous mining machine’s conveyor boom off of hensley by raising the conveyor boom vertically.  according to the interviews, shortly after the conveyor boom was removed, hensley became unresponsive and attempts to revive him were unsuccessful.  
the area near the accident location began to “bump” again, forcing moore, agosti, buskirk, bailey, and goodman to leave the immediate area.  a decision was made to bring additional timbers and cribbing to the accident site to aid in recovery of the victims.  the removal of the loose coal from the entry with the battery scoop was resumed, because the location of both victims had been determined.  timbers were installed in the last open crosscut, the loose coal was removed in the no. 6 entry up to the continuous mining machine, and the entry was supported with wooden cribs installed near the center line of the entry. the following mine officials had also arrived on the no. 1 section: mark white, chief electrician; jamie lester, evening shift mine foreman; willard bourne, evening shift assistant mine foreman; joe athey, operations manager; scott thompson, general mine foreman; and mike day, assistant mine foreman.  these officials arrived between the hours of 8:53 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. mine management decided to have all hourly personnel leave the section.  the section personnel, except for moore, departed for the surface at approximately 10:02 p.m.  the remaining mine officials resumed efforts to recover the victims.at 11:03 p.m., msha inspectors joshua mcneely and james jackson arrived from the madison field office.  in addition, wayne pauley and steve akers, inspectors from the west virginia office of miners’ health safety and training (wvomhst), arrived on the section.  the msha and wvomhst inspectors assisted with recovery of the victims.hensley’s body was recovered at approximately 12:05 a.m., and legg’s body was recovered at approximately 12:21 a.m. on tuesday, may 13, 2014.  the victims were placed on a mantrip for transport to the surface and arrived on the surface at approximately 12:45 a.m.  both victims were transported by the boone county emergency medical assistance (ema) ambulance to the wharton barrett fire department to await the arrival of the medical examiner.  the victims were declared dead by state medical examiner, james kaplan, m.d.  the victims were later transported to the west virginia medical examiner’s office where autopsies were performed."

Partners LP|Coal (Bituminous)|2014-03-25T01:45:00-04:00|Indiana|Indiana|on tuesday, march 25, 2014, timothy w. memmer (victim), maintenance trainee, reported to work on the midnight shift for a normal workday.  jason hosick, maintenance foreman, assigned memmer and chris horton, mechanic, to repair the no. 4 unit feeder.  the side plates that connected the offside cat track assembly to the hopper jack assembly were bent and needed to be replaced.  memmer and horton left the surface at approximately 11:17 p.m. and traveled to the underground mechanics’ shack, which was located at the no. 30 crosscut on the 5th west parallel.  memmer helped gather the required tools needed for the job.  memmer drove a golf cart containing welding and cutting tools to the no. 4 unit and arrived at approximately 11:53 p.m.  horton followed behind memmer on a diesel mantrip containing the needed parts and other tools for the repair.  horton arrived on the unit at 12:37 a.m.after arriving on the unit, memmer prepared the welder and torch for the repair of the feeder.  memmer and horton assessed the location of the feeder and decided to move the feeder to the inby intersection to better access the area of the feeder that needed repair.  horton positioned the feeder and actuated the hopper jacks to elevate the hopper end of the feeder.  memmer, horton, and steve walden, mechanic, constructed a crib underneath the center of the hopper end of the feeder to block the hopper (see appendix a).horton actuated the feeder hopper jack control valve to relieve pressure from the hopper jack pin.  horton crawled under the hopper end of the feeder to remove the jack pin retaining bolt and jack pin bracket bolts using a cutting torch.  horton then handed the torch to memmer to cut the jack pin retaining bolt and jack pin bracket bolts that were on the outside of the pin and bracket.  from underneath the feeder, horton then hit the jack pin with a hammer outward as far as he could, but he could not hammer the pin all the way out because his pin hammer was not long enough.  because of the close proximity of the feeder frame, there was not enough room to use a longer tool to knock the pin out.  horton crawled out from under the feeder.  horton and memmer agreed that the two side plates should be cut in two and removed.  memmer used the torch to cut through the outside plate first.  horton crawled back under the feeder and attempted to hit the hopper jack end of the outside plate off with a sledgehammer, but was not successful.  horton was going to stay underneath the feeder to cut the inner plate, but memmer said he would just cut it from his position on the outside.  memmer then leaned over the top of the cat track to access the inner side plate with the torch.  memmer was using the torch with his left hand and was facing inby.  horton went to the opposite side of the feeder to gather parts from the diesel mantrip and bring them to the side of the feeder being repaired.  horton took one of the replacement plates to the side of the feeder where memmer was working and watched him cut partially through the inner side plate.  horton then started walking back to the opposite side of the feeder to get the other replacement plate.  as horton was walking away, memmer said he had almost cut through the plate.  at approximately 1:45 a.m., horton heard a loud “pop.”  horton turned around and saw memmer pinned between the top of the cat track and the bottom of the hopper.  horton tried to make contact with memmer by shaking him and asking if he was okay.  he did not get any response from memmer.  horton then ran inby to the next intersection and yelled for help.walden, john cooley, and chris cooper, mechanics, heard horton yelling for help.  horton told them that memmer was hurt badly.   at the feeder, walden observed the victim pinned and informed shawn kelley, third shift maintenance foreman via mine phone.  cooley observed that the victim was pinned by the head and arm and he was severely injured.  upon arrival at the feeder, victor banet, third shift unit leadman, told walden to phone for the underground ambulance.  banet brought the scoop to the hopper end of the feeder.  chris burkett, third shift foreman, and ryan carey, laborer, arrived on the section.  carey, who was an experienced scoop operator, operated the scoop to lift the feeder hopper.  banet and cooley removed memmer from the feeder pinch point as carey lifted the hopper end of the feeder with the battery scoop.  cooper laid memmer down on the mine floor and banet attempted resuscitation by starting chest compressions.jade dozier, third shift mine manager, arrived on no. 4 unit with the underground ambulance.  cooley and chad terrell, co technician, placed memmer onto a backboard and then into the underground ambulance.  terrell took over chest compressions on memmer at this time.  at approximately 2:15 a.m., dozier drove the underground ambulance to the man-shaft.  the ambulance was hoisted out of the mine at approximately 2:28 a.m. to the surface, where gibson county ems crew and ambulance were waiting.  gibson county ems assessed memmer and loaded him into the ambulance.  the victim was transported to the gibson general hospital, where he was pronounced dead by the emergency room physician, dr. keh ganiyu, at 2:59 a.m.

kenneth friend; jonathan zinn; aaron friend; bobby morgan; and rodney rosier, general inside laborers, and lambka were assigned to move the belt conveyor.rosier, friend, and lambka walked from the section power center to the belt entry. murphy transported two skids of belt structure to the no. 94 crosscut, back-dragged the entry in preparation for the belt move and then attached the tailpiece to the battery-powered scoop. although not a supervisor, rosier acted as a crew leader and coordinated the belt move. corbin periodically checked on the progress throughout the shift. rosier started the belt and located a splice where the belt could be separated. he then contacted perry mccure, assistant afternoon shift foreman, by radio and requested power to be removed and the belt to be locked out. rosier, friend, and lambka began preparing for the belt move by removing the area lights, the carbon monoxide monitoring system, the waterline, the existing belt structure, and moving and re-anchoring shuttle car trailing cables. they backed the feeder inby; off the tailpiece and removed the tailpiece anchors. they trammed the feeder to the inby side of the no. 95 crosscut and rehung the feeder cable. zinn and friend began constructing a stopping between the belt and return entries at no. 94 block.a roll of conveyor belt approximately 260 feet long was hung above the mine floor to remove the belt structure from a spool and the belt was placed along the rib at 10 foot intervals. the tailpiece was loaded into the scoop bucket and moved outby no. 95 block. rosier, friend, and lambka installed eleven sets of belt structure between the previous feeder location and the tailpiece. they removed the conveyor belt from its spool and spliced it into the existing belt. rosier determined three additional sets of belt structure needed to be installed between the tailpiece and the last set of installed structure. the feeder was backed onto the tailpiece and secured on each side with chains. rosier, friend, and lambka installed the additional structure, three anchor posts for the tailpiece (two on the walk side and one on the tight side), the co monitoring system, a belt crossover, area lighting, and the waterline. rosier radioed james bateman, afternoon shift foreman, requesting that power be restored for the belt to set up the belt take up.demoss and glover completed their roof bolting assignment and were assisting with the construction of the stopping. rosier, kenneth friend, and lambka travelled down the belt line, observed a dip in the belt, and raised it. bateman radioed rosier and told him the belt take-up was set and that the power was restored on the belt, and instructed him to radio gary steyer, hoist operator, to start the f-mains no. 2 belt. rosier radioed steyer to start the belt and yelled that the belt was about to start. morgan was attending the pull cord/key switch immediately outby the tailpiece. as the belt conveyor started, rosier travelled inby toward the tailpiece where lambka and kenny friend were waiting to align it. the belt did not reach full speed when rosier noticed slack in the chain connecting the feeder to the tailpiece on the off side of the belt and asked ""someone to tighten it."" lambka travelled a short distance inby and started to tighten the chain. at approximately 9:00 p.m., as he started to tighten the chain, the off side tailpiece anchor post came loose, causing the tailpiece to pull against the feeder, shifting it, and pinning the victim between the rib and the frame of the feeder. his coworkers recognized lambka was pinned and yelled for morgan to shut down the belt.rosier instructed glover to get one of the shuttle cars and use a chain to pull the feeder away from the rib. glover pulled a shuttle car up to the feeder, connected to the feeder with a chain, and attempted to free lambka. the one half-inch chain was too small and broke. also during this time, simmons attempted to tram the feeder with the manual tram but it would not tram due to the tension on the belt. a larger chain was available, but there was no hook to attach the chain to the feeder. rosier left the area and went to the intake entry to the refuge alternative where he believed a hook was located. he phoned steyer and informed him of the accident and requested an ambulance. rosier was not able to locate a hook and travelled back towards the belt entry to the feeder. corbin had completed an examination of the section, travelled to the power center and back into the belt entry at no. 92 block. he heard persons yelling near the feeder and headed towards it. corbin climbed on top of the feeder and attempted to communicate with lambka. corbin recognized the amount of tension on the belt and gave instructions to cut the belt. the belt was cut, which took tension off the feeder. a hook was located and a chain attached to the shuttle car which pulled the feeder away from the victim. lambka collapsed to the mine floor. simmons and corbin carried lambka to the front of the feeder. zinn and rosier checked for vital signs, but none were detected. corbin attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr), but was unsuccessful. simmons and corbin retrieved the emt supplies and connected an automated external defibrillator (aed) device which advised no shock. cpr was continued until kevin white, emt and bateman arrived. the victim was placed onto a backboard and transported to the surface by mobile utility vehicle (muv). cpr was continued until the victim arrived on the surface where the tucker county ambulance service assumed care. lambka was transported to davis memorial hospital where he was pronounced dead upon arrival by dr. heather harper, state medical examiner."

(using a cigarette lighter is not an acceptable method to check for oxygen deficiency). when geist observed the flame, he told cappanno they needed to retreat from the drift. they took a few steps toward the locomotive when cappanno felt ill and passed out. he was approximately 150 feet from the face. geist was able to stir cappanno and they walked another 50 feet when cappanno again passed out. geist also felt the effects of the carbon monoxide and fell to one knee. geist told cappanno he was going to leave and get help.when geist reached the locomotive, he fell again but managed to climb into the locomotive and exit the drift.jenkins and miller saw geist exit the monogahela drift and head toward the revenue lunchroom.as geist entered the lunchroom, he stated cappanno collapsed about 150 feet from the face in the monogahela drift and needed help. geist warned the others to be careful because there is 9 dead end is an entry or mine passage extending beyond the mine workings into solid ore.an underground passageway either blocked or not mined through.“bad air in the drift.” geist also told them to “turn on some air valves,” referring to the air valves on the compressed air line in the drift.at 7:02 a.m., jenkins, mangus c. lee, miner, kyle e. schoenebaum, miner, and leonardo torres, nipper, left the revenue lunchroom to find cappanno. the locomotive they were using derailed at the blue lagoon. torres remained at the locomotive and tried to get it back on track while the others ran toward the face. as the miners advanced, they stopped to open compressed air valves along the way; however, they did not realize the main airline was shut off near the entrance to the monogahela drift. while trying to re-rail the locomotive, torres felt dizzy and walked out of the drift.at 7:08 a.m., miller called the surface from the revenue lunchroom and spoke to ryan d.glover, mechanic, to inform him of the accident.glover told miller to bring geist out of the mine. after miller’s call, geist also called the surface from the lunchroom and spoke to mark c.coleman, shift surface foreman, and told him that “people are down with cuts and bleeding in bad air and they need help.” miners in the yellow rose drift overheard the calls for help and michael a. mcfarland, miner, christopher c. scott, miner i, arthur m. ficco, miner, and zachary d. ficco, mucker, headed toward the monogahela drift to help. about the same time, miller and geist left the revenue lunchroom and headed toward the portal on a locomotive.in the monogahela drift, lee, jenkins, and schoenebaum found cappanno. he was unconscious, gasping for air, and had facial injuries. the miners tried to carry him out, could not, so began dragging him instead. lee began feeling light headed and retreated. jenkins and schoenebaum continued to drag cappanno. after dragging cappanno approximately 200 feet, jenkins and schoenebaum felt dizzy and stumbled. they left cappanno near a compressed air discharge valve and retreated. jenkins and schoenebaum caught up with lee and assisted him in retreating.at 7:11 a.m., glover, who was on the surface and originally notified of the accident, notified rick williams. at that time, rick williams began to call persons listed on the mine’s emergency contact list. he left a voicemail message for gurule (mine foreman) stating that cappanno went into the monogahela drift, there is no air, he passed out, and there are other miners trying to get him out of the drift.at 7:15 a.m., coleman told rick williams that help was needed underground. rick williams stated he had already been notified. rick williams called daniel m. woodruff, safety manager, and woodruff told him to evacuate the mine and call 9-1-1.at 7:19 a.m., glover called 9-1-1 and reported that one miner was down in the underground mine and requested mine rescue support, life flight (air medical evacuation), and breathing apparatus. glover reported that a miner had passed out underground and they could not get to him because there was no ventilation. glover handed the phone to coleman and went to the surface lunchroom to monitor the mine pager phone.about 7:21 a.m., a. ficco, z. ficco, mcfarland, and scott were traveling on a locomotive in the revenue tunnel toward the monogahela drift when they met miller and geist at the terrible drift, traveling out. the miners traded locomotives and a. ficco transported geist to the surface while z. ficco, mcfarland, scott, and miller continued to the monogahela drift.at 7:30 a.m., michael l. luther, miner, entered the monogahela drift to try to help cappanno and passed jenkins, schoenebaum and lee who were retreating from the drift. luther reached cappanno and attempted to revive him by providing breaths. when cappanno did not respond, luther dragged cappanno as he retreated.when jenkins, schoenebaum, and lee exited the monogahela drift, torres asked jenkins how to use his msa model w-65 self-rescuer. jenkins told torres not to go back into the monogahela drift, but torres donned his w-65 self-rescuer and went to look for cappanno. torres arrived to find luther with cappanno. luther helped to place cappanno on torres’s shoulder and they retreated toward the revenue tunnel. as torres carried cappanno, he felt nauseated, stopped, and removed his w-65 self-rescuer because he thought it was not working properly. after retreating about 100 feet, torres felt lightheaded and could not continue. he left luther with cappanno and retreated. luther dragged cappanno about 50 feet and then collapsed. after breathing from a compressed air valve, luther felt better but was unable to drag cappanno any farther. after retreating another 50 feet, luther passed out.at 7:35 a.m., rick williams called john r. trujillo, project director, to inform him of the accident. rick williams then loaded two 30-minute air packs on a locomotive and traveled into the mine. about this time, jenkins, schoenebaum, and lee left the revenue lunchroom on a locomotive and headed to the surface. on the way out, they met rick williams in the revenue tunnel. rick williams returned to the surface with lee and jenkins, while schoenebaum returned to the revenue lunchroom with the 30-minute air packs. after retrieving two additional 30-minute air packs, rick williams, glover, and yurgartis reentered the mine on a locomotive and traveled toward the monogahela drift.miller and mcfarland entered the monogahela drift on foot, carrying a stretcher and an oxygen bottle, while scott gathered air hoses and z. ficco searched for an available locomotive.miller and mcfarland found torres disoriented and sitting against a rib. as miller helped torres to a compressed air valve in an attempt to revive him, mcfarland continued advancing. when torres felt well enough to exit the drift, miller left him and went to catch up with mcfarland.they found luther laying unresponsive in the track. mcfarland attempted to provide oxygen to luther, but had no hose for the regulator. they placed luther on the stretcher and retreated dragging the stretcher.scott met miller and mcfarland dragging luther on the stretcher. scott helped carry the stretcher to the derailed locomotive. mcfarland was unable to continue and retreated.miller remained with luther. scott went back to look for cappanno, opening compressed air valves along the way, and found that the main airline was off. before reaching the water pump, he found the main airline valve and opened it. scott continued advancing and connected a 50-foot long air hose to an air valve beyond the chinaman chute and secured the hose just past a collapsed chute. scott advanced until he became disoriented and retreated approximately 900 feet to the refuge chamber.z. ficco found a locomotive and entered the monogahela drift where he met mcfarland and torres coming out. z. ficco continued advancing and stopped at the derailed locomotive where he found miller with luther. miller and z. ficco carried luther around the derailed locomotive, hooked the stretcher to the back of z. ficco’s locomotive and pulled luther to the revenue lunchroom.paulsen and maier arrived at the revenue lunchroom from the virginius south and rick williams, glover, and yurgartis arrived with the additional air packs from the surface.rick williams discussed what to do next with schoenebaum, z. ficco, and mcfarland. schoenebaum and mcfarland did not have enough strength to don air packs, so they retreated to the surface with luther. rick williams instructed z. ficco, paulsen, and maier to remain at the lunchroom and all other miners were instructed to evacuate the mine.at 8:00 a.m., rick williams and z. ficco donned air packs and entered the monogahela drift.they parked at the derailed locomotive and advanced on foot. when they reached cappanno, approximately 700 feet beyond the derailed locomotive, they checked his vital signs and found none. z. ficco attempted to revive cappanno by placing the face-piece of his air pack on cappanno, however, cappanno did not respond. z. ficco re-donned his face-piece and told rick williams they needed to retreat. rick williams and z. ficco retreated while dragging cappanno.rick williams told z. ficco that he could not continue and retreated. z. ficco continued to drag cappanno approximately 400 feet when his air pack’s low-air alarm sounded and he retreated as well. on the way out of the drift, z. ficco found rick williams lying against a rib approximately 50 feet from the derailed locomotive. z. ficco motioned to rick williams that he was out of oxygen and they needed to get out. rick williams nodded and pointed out. as z. ficco retreated, his air pack ran out of air and he realized rick williams was not with him, but had returned to cappanno.when z. ficco arrived at the revenue lunchroom, ronald f. “bumper” williams (no relation to rick williams or rory williams), a member of the san juan cooperative mine rescue team (sjcmrt) and ouray county emergency medical service (ems), called in from the surface to request a ride into the mine. z. ficco left the lunchroom on a locomotive and traveled approximately 1,000 feet toward the portal. z. ficco met daniel l. ficco, electrician, a. ficco, and jason m. rockwell, miner’s helper, riding in a locomotive driven by michael t.mccracken, core driller, advancing with four air packs provided by the ouray county fire department and three stretchers. they traded locomotives at the terrible drift and z. ficco continued to the surface.at 8:15 a.m., d. ficco and a. ficco donned air packs and entered the monogahela drift. about 300 feet beyond the derailed locomotive, they found rick williams administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) to cappanno. they attempted to place an air pack on rick williams, but he resisted. they urged rick williams to his feet and he walked approximately 50 feet before collapsing. d. ficco and a. ficco placed cappanno on a stretcher. they placed rick williams on a second stretcher and carried him out approximately 20 feet when the low-air alarm for a. ficco’s air pack sounded and he retreated. d. ficco continued to drag rick williams another 20 feet.ronald williams (sjcmrt) was delayed on the surface because a gas detector that he needed was locked in the safety manager’s office and he had to wait until the door was unlocked.at 8:30 a.m., he entered the mine on a locomotive with two additional air packs, blankets, and the gas detector. approximately 500 feet into the drift, ronald williams’s gas detector alarmed and he donned an air pack. the gas detector’s readings were reported as: 860 ppm co, 10% no2 [sic.], and 19.5% o2. ronald williams advanced on foot to the derailed locomotive where he met a. ficco, who was retreating from the drift. ronald williams told a. ficco there was an additional air pack on the locomotive. when ronald williams reached d. ficco and rick williams, he helped drag rick williams another 30 feet toward the locomotive. at that time, d. ficco’s low-air alarm sounded and he retreated.a. ficco donned the spare air pack and returned to ronald williams to assist with rick williams. when d. ficco reached the locomotive, there were no remaining air packs, so he retreated to the refuge chamber on foot.ronald williams dragged cappanno to the derailed locomotive and checked his vital signs but found no pulse. ronald williams left cappanno and went to help with rick williams. when a. ficco returned, the low-air alarm for ronald williams’s air pack sounded. at that time, ronald williams ran to an air hose attached to the main air line. a. ficco dragged rick williams to the air hose and went to the locomotive to get blankets.ronald williams used a whip check to attach an air hose to rick williams’s wrist. rick williams was still breathing at that time. ronald williams retreated, complaining he felt ill and passed a. ficco on his way out. a. ficco returned to cappanno and rick williams and covered them with blankets. rick williams was experiencing difficulty breathing. a. ficco remained with him for approximately five minutes before retreating.d. ficco, a. ficco, and ronald williams all retreated to the refuge chamber where paulsen instructed them to evacuate the mine.the sjcmrt arrived at the mine and entered the portal at 1:05 p.m. by 2:01 p.m., they alerted the command center they were retreating with rick williams and cappanno. at 2:13 p.m., they arrived at the surface where the ouray county coroner pronounced the victims dead. the cause of death for both victims was attributed to acute carbon monoxide poisoning.mine rescue operations as set forth above in the “description of the accident,” glover called 9-1-1 at approximately 7:19 a.m. on november 17, 2013. he asked the 9-1-1- dispatcher for ronald f. “bumper” williams. the montrose regional dispatch center (mrdc) alerted the local ouray county ems, mountain rescue, and the ouray county sherriff’s department.at 7:30 a.m., ronald williams received a page from the ouray county ems concerning the emergency at the mine.at 7:48 a.m., mountain rescue notified the mrdc that a mine rescue team was needed at the mine because mountain rescue was not equipped or qualified to go underground.at 7:51 a.m., mrdc notified ronald williams of the accident.at 7:52 a.m., woodruff (safety manager) notified msha of the mine emergency.at 7:57 a.m., ronald williams arrived at the mine, called underground and spoke to z. ficco, who was in the revenue lunchroom, to request a ride into the mine.joe c. smart, lezah j. saunders, richard l. peterson and john m. gillon (who also worked at the revenue mine, but was off on the day of the accident) of the sjcmrt were alerted and gathered at the mine rescue station in ridgeway, colorado, approximately 17 miles from the mine. a fifth mine rescue team member, thomas a. bird, was dispatched directly to the mine to assess the situation.at 8:40 a.m., the sjcmrt was notified that six miners were out of the mine and on stretchers and ten miners were still in the mine. the team was mobilized and prepared to depart for the mine. at 9:22 a.m., the gcc energy llc, king coal mine rescue team was also called and placed on standby. at approximately 10:00 a.m., both teams departed for the mine.the sjcmrt arrived at the mine at 10:29 a.m. and prepared to go underground. during their briefing, they were instructed to enter the portal, travel along the revenue tunnel toward the monogahela drift and call out to the surface at every mine phone location. at 1:05 p.m., they donned their apparatuses and entered the mine. the gcc energy llc team remained on the surface as a backup team during the entire time that the sjcmrt was underground.by 1:40 p.m., the sjcmrt had traveled along the revenue tunnel and arrived at the revenue lunchroom. at that time, the team requested that they be allowed to break communication and travel into the monogahela drift. permission was granted, but at 1:42 p.m., the team called out to inform the surface that they were in the monogahela drift, they had measured 36 ppm carbon monoxide, and that they were continuing on to locate the missing miners.10 at that time, the gcc energy team was staged and ready to go into the mine if the sjcmrt did not call out again within 20 minutes.10 from interviews with the sjcmrt members and as verified by the surface incident command rescue log, the team had not encountered concentrations of carbon monoxide or any other airborne contaminant until they reached this area of the mine. although they did not report additional concentrations of gases from the drift, peak readings provided by the sjcmrt from their gas detector showed that the environment contained much more (i.e., a low of 18.8 percent oxygen; a high of 1,371 ppm carbon monoxide; and a high of 10 ppm nitrogen dioxide).when the sjcmrt reached the derailed locomotive, they found nicholas cappanno and rick williams on stretchers. neither of them had a pulse, but rick williams was still warm. the team placed a spare breathing apparatus on him and loaded both miners on a locomotive for transport.at 2:01 p.m., the sjcmrt alerted the command center that they were at the revenue lunchroom and were retreating with one “deceased” miner (cappanno) and one “warm miner with no pulse” (rick williams). life flight had been called and was en route to the mine.as the team traveled out of the mine, they administered cpr and rescue breaths, via the apparatus bypass button, to rick williams until they reached the surface.at 2:13 p.m., the sjcmrt exited the mine portal with the victims. emt’s continued to perform cpr on rick williams. life flight arrived and rick williams was pronounced dead at 2:42 p.m.all miners and mine rescue team members were out of the mine and the portal entrance was locked at approximately 3:20 p.m.

(see appendix a)schwartz told meece that he was going to walk past the shuttle car.  he then walked through a ventilation curtain as he was walking past the shuttle car.  when schwartz was clear, he was out of meece’s line of sight, so he turned and verbally told meece that he was clear.  schwartz also gave a signal with his cap lamp to let meece know that he was clear.  meece started the pump motor of the shuttle car, rang his warning bell, and flashed his headlights two times in the direction of travel.  meece then began tramming through the curtain and towards the no. 7 entry.  meece saw that there was another shuttle car cable laying in the entry.  as he trammed forward, meece steered away from the cable, which was on the operator’s side of his shuttle car.  as he trammed closer to the cable, he heard schwartz yell.  meece stopped the shuttle car and began to exit the operator’s cab when he heard schwartz tell him to back the shuttle car up because he was hurt.  meece got back in the shuttle car and moved it backwards away from schwartz.rodriguez was sitting in his shuttle car at crosscut 47 between entries 7 and 8 waiting for the continuous mining machine to be set up and mining to begin.  rodriguez heard schwartz yell and went to investigate.  rodriguez walked through a ventilation curtain and saw schwartz lying on his left side, next to the inby rib with his head towards no. 7 entry.  rodriguez ran to schwartz to help him.  meece exited his shuttle car and also went to help schwartz.  rodriguez and meece realized that schwartz needed more help than they could provide, so meece went to find tooley.  meece saw travis vories, roof bolter, near the dinner hole and told him that schwartz had been injured.  vories went to schwartz and tried to help rodriguez in responding to the accident.  vories then went back to the dinner hole and paged the surface communication center on the mine phone.  the communication center did not respond.  vories asked if anyone could hear him.  an unidentified miner from the no. 1 unit told vories that they could hear him. vories told the miner on the no. 1 unit that schwartz had been injured.  the miner said that he would call the communication center and inform them of the accident.  a citation that did not contribute to the accident was issued for a violation of 30 cfr 75.1600-1 because the responsible person in the communication center on the surface did not respond immediately in this emergency situation.vories obtained the backboard and went to schwartz’s location.  rodriguez left and travelled toward the faces to get other miners to help.  rodriguez told baker and western that schwartz had been injured.  they both ran to schwartz’s location.  rodriguez continued to look for more help.  rodriguez found truelove on the battery-powered scoop.  rodriguez told him that schwartz had been injured and to take the scoop to the accident site to assist transporting schwartz outby the unit.  truelove trammed the scoop to the intersection of no. 5 entry and crosscut 46.  tooley met truelove at the coal feeder and they discussed the location of the accident.  tooley traveled to schwartz’s location with truelove tramming the scoop behind tooley.  truelove parked the scoop at the intersection of the no. 6 entry and crosscut 47.  truelove then exited the scoop and went to help other miners care for schwartz.  tooley went to the mine phone to alert the communication center that schwartz possibly had internal injuries and then went to get the stretcher.tom rainey, communication center dispatcher, called 911 and reported that schwartz had internal injuries.  rainey also called keith brock, belt coordinator, who was underground.  rainey told him that schwartz had been hurt, and that brock was needed to drive the underground ambulance to the no. 5 unit to transport schwartz from the unit to the surface.  vories, baker, jeff dreiman, roof bolter, and tooley placed schwartz on the stretcher.  tooley examined schwartz for major injuries and did not find any serious external injuries.  tooley sent western to the mine phone to inform the communication center that schwartz had been placed on the battery-powered scoop and was being transported outby the unit to meet the underground ambulance.  rainey asked about schwartz’s vital signs and tooley said that he would check them.  tooley sent baker to the medical box to get the blood pressure cuff and stethoscope.  schwartz told tooley that the strap was too tight across his chest.  tooley loosened the strap to give schwartz some comfort.  brock and tom bailey, outby roof bolter, arrived with the underground ambulance.  truelove, rodriguez, baker, brock, and dreiman moved schwartz from the scoop bucket and placed him in the ambulance.  baker returned with the stethoscope but schwartz had already been loaded onto the ambulance and was being transported to the surface.  as bailey drove the ambulance, brock was tending to schwartz and truelove was riding in the passenger seat.  after arriving on the surface at 3:26 p.m., bailey drove the ambulance to the helicopter pad where pike county ems and airevac 17 were waiting.  when transferred to ems, vital signs were still present for the victim.  while schwartz was being transported to the university of louisville hospital, at  4:31 p.m. ems could not measure vital signs.  schwartz was pronounced dead at 4:51 p.m. by megan m. bertke, m.d.

Virginia|Coal|Metinvest B V|Coal (Bituminous)|2013-02-19T19:10:00-05:00|WestVirginia|WestVirginia|at approximately 1:30 p.m. on tuesday, february 19, 2013, the mine experienced a power outage due to the failure of an insulator on the high voltage power line supplying power to the mining complex.all underground miners were brought to the surface during the power outage and no work resumed until after the power was restored at approximately 4:00 p.m. the evening shift production crews, which normally start work at 3:30 p.m., waited on the surface of the mine until all of the required underground areas of the mine were examined by certified persons once the mine’s power had been restored.joey howlett, section foreman and emergency medical technician (emt), traveled to the number 3 section to conduct pre-shift examinations for the evening shift production crew. he arrived on the section at 4:55 p.m., conducted the examinations and called out the pre-shift report to the mine office at 5:17 p.m. after calling out the report, howlett stayed on the section and tightened ventilation curtains across the section while awaiting the arrival of the evening shift production crew.when the pre-shift examinations were completed and reported for the mine, the number 3 section production crew entered the mine via the 19-person hoist and traveled to the end of the 3 section track on a diesel-powered man trip.at the end of the track, the section crew transferred to two rubber-tired battery man trips. one of the man trips proceeded to the section and the other man trip was delayed for approximately 10 to 15 minutes while charging batteries before proceeding on to the section.at 5:42 p.m., the evening shift production crew arrived on the number 3 section and richard laramee, assistant mine foreman, conducted a safety talk with the crew. after finishing the safety talk, the crew reported to their respective machines and began preparations to start mining. laramee proceeded to examine the working faces of the number 5 through number 9 entries and howlett examined the face areas of the number 1 through number 4 entries (see appendix c). after completing his examination, laramee instructed adam whitt and brad cogswell, right side roof bolting machine operators, to install additional roof bolts in the number 6 entry.laramee also directed justin ward, scoop operator, to clean (scoop) some areas of the section.john myles, number 12 shuttle car operator, could not perform his normal duties because the shuttle car was inoperative.the number 12 shuttle car had a defective hydraulic pump motor. since the shuttle car was inoperative, laramee asked myles to help ward clean the section by shoveling loose material along the coal ribs after each area was scooped.myles informed ward that he was going to be helping him and retrieved a shovel from the scoop that ward was operating. ward operated the scoop and began cleaning the crosscut between the number 5 and 6 entries. the scoop was used to scrape along each rib and then once down the middle of the crosscut.the material was pushed into number 6 entry and then to the number 6 entry face.laramee helped myles move the ventilation curtain and right side continuous mining machine cable in the (number 18) crosscut between the number 6 and number 7 entries.ward then cleaned the crosscut with the scoop. myles shoveled loose coal along the ribs, throwing it out into the middle of the roadway to be scooped again later. laramee last saw myles shoveling in the number 18 crosscut between the number 5 and 6 entries.while ward operated the scoop and pushed loose coal into the number 6 entry face, he observed myles shoveling in the number 18 crosscut between the number 6 and 7 entries. when ward finished cleaning the number 6 entry, he backed the scoop into the crosscut between the number 5 and number 6 entries (opposite the area he had last seen myles working in).the number 18 crosscut between the number 5 and 6 entries had been previously cleaned but ward began cleaning it a second time to make it easier for myles to shovel.as the scoop backed into the crosscut, ward heard a noise which caused him to stop.he twice yelled for myles, but did not receive an answer. ward then exited the scoop and walked along the operator’s side to the rear of the machine.he observed myles pinned underneath the batteries of the scoop. ward immediately called out for help to howlett, section foreman and emergency medical technician (emt).william hensley, continuous mining machine operator, was servicing the left side continuous mining machine in the number 3 entry when he was informed of the accident. hensley immediately went to the accident site and found myles pinned underneath the scoop batteries. he instructed josh petry and edmund vance, left side roof bolter operators, to get first aid supplies and find howlett.myles was having difficulty breathing and hensley attempted to clear his airway. laramee and whitt arrived at the accident scene and provided further assistance.the men noticed that the scoop batteries were not touching myles, and hensley instructed whitt to move the scoop to the number 6 entry where it would not be in the way. howlett arrived and he and petry began getting a backboard to place beneath myles to help with transporting the victim.myles was secured to a backboard, and cardiac pulmonary resuscitation (cpr) was started by howlett because they were having difficulty finding a pulse. a rubber-tired battery mantrip was brought to the accident site and a seat was removed to accommodate the stretcher.larry reedy, fire boss, arrived on the section to further aid the victim.hensley, howlett, and reedy transported myles to the end of the track, and then transferred him onto a rail-mounted diesel man trip.a gravel car was wrecked on the main track at the gravel hole spur track switch, but a second diesel man trip was waiting on the other side. myles was transferred to the second ride and taken to the shaft bottom and transported out of the mine on the hoist. the ambulance service was called at 7:17 p.m.myles arrived on the surface at approximately 7:49 p.m., where jan care ambulance service was waiting.myles was then transported from the mine to the raleigh general hospital in beckley, west virginia, where he was pronounced dead at 10:50 p.m. on february 19, 2013.

Virginia|Coal|CONSOL Energy Inc.|Coal (Bituminous)|2013-02-12T21:40:00-05:00|WestVirginia|WestVirginia|on february 12, 2013, the afternoon shift started at 4:00 p.m. kevin carter, shift foreman (sugar run) assigned clutter and scott shay, general inside laborers, to transport supplies from sugar run to miracle run. clutter and shay entered the mine at the miracle run portal shortly after 4:00 p.m. they each took a locomotive (motor) and travelled from miracle run to sugar run. shay operated the no. 55b motor (lead) and clutter was operating the no. 51 motor (tail). they were delayed at no. 55 block near the sugar run portal bottom due to water over the track. upon arrival at sugar run, clutter and shay spoke with tim shaffer, shift foreman (sugar run). shaffer told them to transport a trip of supplies needed for the metz portal to miracle run and bring back empty supply cars. the metz motor crews would then take these supplies from miracle run to the metz portal. shaffer instructed clutter and shay to evaluate the weight of the contents of the supply cars and determine if it was possible to transport everything in one trip. clutter and shay decided the supplies needed taken in two trips of four cars.the slope crew dropped the first four cars down the tail track. clutter and shay retrieved the four cars on sugar run bottom. before leaving, they spoke with shaffer again to decide where to place the empty supply cars when they returned. shaffer instructed them to place the empty supply cars in the crossover entry. clutter and shay coupled the first trip and proceeded to miracle run where they transferred the supplies to the metz supply motor crew. there were no issues encountered on the first trip. they then picked up six empty supply cars to take back to sugar run. upon returning to sugar run, they put the empty cars in the crossover and waited for the slope supply crew to drop the cars for their second trip. the slope crew dropped the other cars into the mine. clutter and shay discussed where to place the cars on the miracle run side. it was decided to place the cars from the second trip in the 60-pound spur at miracle run. they believed the 60-pound track spur was more level than the loaded track, and clutter was concerned the trip could get away from them due to its weight and placing the trip in the spur with one motor. clutter and shay hooked onto the supplies and proceeded towards miracle run.the no. 55b motor was the lead motor heading toward miracle run. the trip was composed of four longwall shield carriers. the carrier behind the no. 55b motor contained a longwall tailgate drive motor, the next carrier contained a longwall shearer drum and ranging arm, the third carrier contained longwall hydraulic hoses, and the last carrier contained electrical cables and reels. the no. 51 motor completed the trip. just before reaching the miracle run bottom, the cars behind the no. 55b motor derailed between the no. 124 and 126 blocks. clutter and shay evaluated the derailment and decided to put the cars back on the track one at a time beginning with the end of the first car adjacent to the no. 55b motor (see appendix i). they decided to use cribbing materials and airbags. clutter and shay began by separating the cars to make room for the airbag. working on the “wire side” of the track, the air hose was extended and the airbag was placed under the coupler with the intention of lifting the car straight up. they placed the air bag on the mine floor and placed cribbing between the airbag and the coupler. when the car was lifted with the airbag, the trucks (wheels) were turned and the flange of the wheels would not clear the top of the rail. a slate bar was used to straighten the wheels to align them with the rail and force the flange over the rail. shay stated that when clutter barred the wheel, the car suddenly shifted approximately 3 to 4 inches toward the wire-side with “tremendous force.”  when the car shifted, it contacted the slate bar, causing it to strike clutter on the right side of his face and forehead. shay asked clutter if he was okay and received no response. shay checked clutter and saw that he was seriously injured and called jack saurborn, dispatcher, for help. saurborn radioed for anyone in the area to provide assistance and called for an ambulance.rocky polce, maintenance foreman, arrived first at the accident scene. shortly thereafter, ernie payne and john nicholson, mechanics, and bob mcbee, general inside laborer, also responded. first aid was administered and the victim was placed on a backboard and transported to the miracle run bottom. while en route, polce called the dispatcher and instructed him to call for a life flight. clutter was taken to miracle run bottom, transferred to a mobile cart, placed in the elevator, and transported to the surface. the grant town fire department arrived approximately three minutes after clutter arrived on the surface. clutter was transferred to an ambulance and taken to a helicopter. clutter was taken to ruby memorial hospital where he was pronounced dead at 3:27 p.m. on february 14, 2013.

V|Coal (Bituminous)|2013-02-07T21:20:00-05:00|WestVirginia|WestVirginia|on the day of the accident, ron short, hoist operator, performed the required daily examination of the 30-ton service hoist at 8:00 a.m.  short indicated in the examination record book that the hoist was in safe operating condition.  the hoist was also examined by william lusk, certified electrician, on the day of the accident as part of the weekly examinations required for electrical equipment.  again, no hazards associated with the hoist were noted in the record book for the weekly electrical examinations.steve colo iii, construction foreman, held a brief meeting with edward finney, scoop operator, brian southern and chris donaldson, both outby utility men, prior to the men entering the mine on the evening shift on february 7, 2013.  colo informed the crew of their job duties for the upcoming shift.  he instructed the crew to pick up trash along the old intake entries on the west side of the service hoist, using the outby battery-powered scoop and a metal bucket insert.  the scoop bucket insert, once filled with trash, was to be placed on the 30-ton service hoist and sent to the surface to be unloaded.  according to colo’s instructions, this cycle was to be repeated until all of the trash was removed from the designated area of the mine.the mine’s communication and tracking system indicated that finney, southern, and donaldson arrived underground at the bottom of the service shaft at 3:06 p.m. to begin their work.  the outby scoop they were to use was normally located on the east side of the service hoist, but it had to be moved across the hoist platform, to the west side, by opening both the east and west side gates.  once on the west side of the hoist, the scoop and men would then travel through a set of air lock doors and enter the intake air course where they were to pick up trash.once in the intake air course, the crew picked up trash and placed it in the scoop bucket insert, where it was then taken to the service hoist and sent out of the mine.  southern stated in interviews that three or four loads of trash had been taken from the intake entries to the hoist prior to the time the accident occurred. a review of the mine’s electronic tracking system report shows that the scoop arrived at the bottom of the service shaft, along with finney, southern and donaldson at 8:54 p.m.  the tracking system also shows that three previous trips to the service hoist had been made by the crew prior to that time.finney was operating the scoop and was moving the machine forward, bucket first, toward the service hoist to unload a bucket insert full of trash.  as he approached the hoist, he positioned the scoop bucket on top of the hoist deck so that he could push the insert out of the scoop’s bucket and onto the hoist. donaldson and southern were standing on each side of the scoop observing the operation.  donaldson, who was standing on the left side of the scoop and facing towards the hoist, stated that as the insert was being pushed out of the scoop bucket and onto the hoist, the hoist warning lights started flashing, indicating that the hoist was going to start.  donaldson then yelled “run, get out”, and ran past the scoop as the hoist was starting to elevate up the shaft, picking the bucket end of the scoop off of the mine floor.southern, standing on the operator’s side of the scoop, observed that the warning lights were flashing after donaldson had yelled and warned everyone to run.  southern immediately yelled for finney to “get out of the scoop, its starting up.”  southern stated that the front end of the scoop was already approximately four feet off of the mine floor when he started running to get clear of the scoop.  when southern was behind the scoop, and out of danger, he turned to see if finney had exited the scoop.  he stated that finney appeared to be falling, head first, to the mine floor about the same time the scoop bucket slipped off the hoist deck and fell to the ground, which created a lot of dust, making it difficult to see clearly.  southern immediately ran to check finney’s condition and found him to be unresponsive, as he was located underneath the operator’s deck of the scoop. glenn paugh, maintenance foreman, was working at the no. 2 high voltage disconnect box when the accident occurred, and arrived at the scene approximately 4 minutes after the accident, and saw that finney had received fatal crushing injuries.  emergency medical technician (emt) larry reedy was 11 crosscuts away along the no. 1 conveyor belt at the time of the accident and arrived at the hoist at 9:24 p.m., as indicated by the mine tracking system.   emt chris cadle was working on no.1 unit, received a call and arrived at the hoist at 9:48 p.m. as indicated by the mine tracking system.  paugh energized the scoop in order to lift it off of finney.  paugh, reedy, and cadle placed finney on a backboard and transported him to the 19 man hoist on a four wheeled, rubber- tired mantrip, where he was then taken to the surface.  the jan care ambulance service had arrived at the mine site prior to the victim reaching the surface. finney was transported via ambulance to the blue ridge funeral home in beckley, wv, where lisa sadler, medical examiner, pronounced him dead at 9:50 p.m.

Five Mile Prep Plant & Refuse Impoundment/West Virginia|Coal|Patriot Coal Corporation|Coal (Bituminous)|2013-01-26T11:25:00-05:00|FiveMilePrepPlant&RefuseImpoundment/WestVirginia|West Virginia|the day shift began prior to 6:00 a.m., with roy gibson, plant foreman, performing a pre-shift examination, first of the press building and then of the preparation plant building.  no hazardous conditions were observed nor recorded for this examination.  with his shift starting at 6:00 a.m., jeffrey “ted” smith, day shift press operator, met with tom hull, night shift press operator, about the operation of the two filter presses during the previous shift.  hull indicated to smith that the b-press had an intermittent issue with stopping during its pressing cycle.  hull told smith that b-press stopped while pressing up and began its feed cycle prematurely.  hull resolved the issue by manually pausing and then restarting the b-press in order for it to complete the cycle.  hull mentioned no inconsistencies with the operation of the a-press during his shift.as a normal part of his shift, smith began to operate the presses via the human machine interface (hmi) computer which controls the presses by a control screen in the press building control room which is connected to the programmable logic controller (plc) system in the motor control center (mcc) room.  the operation continued without incident until approximately 11:00 a.m., when slurry began to spray heavily out of the top of b-press during its feed cycle.  slurry sprayed from the b-press with sufficient force to tear insulation from the ceiling of the press building.  smith, who was working on “dropping cakes” (removing dewatered or compressed refuse material from between press plates as the press opens) out of the a-press, paused the machine and went quickly to the control room to pause the b-press.  a large amount of slurry had sprayed from the machine, covering smith also.  after pausing the b-press, smith returned to complete the dropping of cakes from the a-press. upon completion of the drop cycle on the a-press, the slurry feed pump unexpectedly started while the press was still in an open position, which was not the normal operating sequence.  slurry began to spray into the a-press, while the membrane plates were not pressed together.  this event caused smith to quickly pause the a-press and report the malfunction to david kimbrell, plant superintendent, via a company radio. smith returned to the control room with both presses still paused.  while waiting for kimbrell, smith noticed the control screen indicated that the b-press was in the pressing cycle.  smith knew this was incorrect, as slurry was feeding into the machine when the blow-out occurred.when kimbrell arrived at the press control room, smith told him he had lost control of both presses and he expressed frustration regarding the press problems.  smith left kimbrell at the control room and joined travis shamblin, plant technician, to help wash down the walls and clean-up the slurry spill.  upon hearing about the spill on the company radio, bobby phalen, property manager, phoned dwight given, maintenance manager, informed him of the press problems and requested his assistance.  phalen traveled to the press building to assist with the clean-up and gibson arrived to help kimbrell and phalen.  smith returned to the press control room and expressed his frustration to gibson over the loss of control of the presses.  smith told gibson that he needed a break and gibson concurred.  smith got his lunch box and went to the employee change trailer to change clothes.  kimbrell, phalen, shamblin, and gibson went to the mine office to take a lunch break. following the lunch break, gibson went to the change trailer to check on smith who had not returned from lunch.  smith, visibly upset and covered in slurry, confronted gibson once more about the loss of control of the two presses and slurry blow-outs that had been occurring.  gibson asked smith if he would like to go home.  smith left the property just before 1:00 p.m.upon returning to the press building, gibson asked shamblin if he would operate the presses since smith had left the property.  shamblin agreed and went with kimbrell and phalen to restart the b-press.  gibson temporarily left the press building and traveled to the plant to address other unrelated issues with the plant decanter.  when the b-press was restarted, it once again sprayed slurry.  the b-press was opened and a torn filter cloth on one of the plates was found and replaced.  the b-press was then restarted only to find another leak.  gibson returned from the plant and began to help diagnose the problem with the b-press, spraying water to wash off the individual plates of the machine, as shamblin and phalen spread the plates apart in the area of the leak.while clean-up work continued on the b-press, given arrived to assist in troubleshooting the problems that were occurring with the two presses.  given suggested it might be helpful to reset the power to the plcs for both presses since the plcs control the automation and sequencing of the filter press system.  given reset the power to the plcs by opening and closing the related circuit breakers.  resetting power did not resolve the problems.  given went to the plant office and attempted to call hulin cook jr., senior manager of power and automation, noah toney, electrical control specialist, and brandon townsend, specialist of electrical processes.  given was unable to contact any of the three men and instead left voice mail messages for them at approximately 12:30 p.m., informing them of the press problems.kimbrell called joe white, preparation plant engineer, who was at the nearby kanawha eagle preparation plant, and described the press problems to him.  white left kanawha eagle preparation plant to assist kimbrell.  while traveling to the press building, white called cook, who was in kentucky, and asked him to call given.  cook called given and discussed the press problems.  meanwhile, townsend received given’s voice message and returned his call, letting him know that he was also on his way to the site.given was able to make contact with toney, who was at another location.  toney began to monitor the plc program remotely in order to assist in the troubleshooting of the presses.  kimbrell, troubleshooting from the press building control room, relayed messages to given (via company radio) who then relayed them to toney over the telephone.  white arrived on property at approximately 1:47 p.m., traveled to the press building, and assisted gibson and phalen in troubleshooting the b-press.  another attempt was made to operate the b-press and again another slurry leak was found.  white went to the plant office to discuss the issues with given concerning the b-press.  white told given they thought the problem with the b-press involved torn filter cloth.white and kimbrell decided to check-out the a-press while the filter cloth was being changed on the b-press.  townsend arrived on site at approximately 2:49 p.m., and traveled to the press building.  townsend met with white, kimbrell, and phalen, and they briefly discussed the problem they were experiencing with the a-press, namely that the feed cycle started out of sequence.  townsend traveled to the mcc room and set-up his laptop computer. phalen returned to the mine office and told given that townsend was on site.  given proceeded to the press building and met townsend.  given and townsend entered the press building together and went up to the second floor.  kimbrell also met given and townsend at the top of the stairs and told them they needed to get the a-press back to the beginning of the cycle.  kimbrell anticipated a potential slurry leak and asked given to sit at the control room computer in order to pause the machine should something go wrong.  the a-press was manually closed and then switched to the automatic mode so that it could complete its normal cycle.  the a-press continued its automatic cycle, feeding the slurry, compressing the material, and then began to open as normal in order to drop out the cakes without incident.  white traveled down the off-side walkway toward the feed end of the a-press.  townsend followed kimbrell down the opposite walkway from the control room toward the feed end of the a-press as it began to open.with white on the off-side walkway and kimbrell and townsend on the control room side walkway, the men began dislodging the caked material from between each plate, using boat paddles to dislodge the cakes, slowly working their way back toward the cylinder end of the a-press, observing it as it opened.  this cycle was completed without incident and the next cycle began automatically as the hydraulic pump started and the hydraulic cylinders began to extend, closing the a-press.  kimbrell and townsend continued toward the control room.  kimbrell turned right and stepped into the control room doorway to watch the control screen with given.townsend turned left into the walkway between the a-press and the b-press, stopping behind the hydraulic cylinders of the a-press (see appendix c), in order to examine the hydraulic pressure gauge mounted on top of the upper cylinder (about at eye level) of the a-press.  at approximately 4:00 p.m., while townsend was standing in the walkway between the two presses, examining the pressure gauge, there was a sudden and catastrophic failure of both hydraulic cylinders. in an instant, the broken cylinder barrels (weighing over  2,000 pounds each), shot into the walkway, crashing into the end guarding and thrusting it against townsend, driving him back, approximately 7-8 feet, into adjacent guarding and piping on the b-press.  he was caught between the two sections of displaced guarding and pinned against the adjacent press by the hydraulic cylinder barrels where he sustained multiple traumatic injuries which led to his death.  simultaneously, white was struck in the face.  the blow left white lying on the walkway with serious injuries including a broken jaw and missing teeth.kimbrell was standing in the control room doorway and was sprayed from behind with hydraulic oil as he heard the sudden failure of the press.  kimbrell turned around and rushed to the aid of townsend.  as kimbrell was attending to townsend, he noticed movement on the opposite side of the presses and observed white standing up with a laceration on his chin.  kimbrell asked white if he was alright and white acknowledged him.  white (injured, stunned and unaware of townsend’s location), traveled downstairs and outside to the mine office to assess his injuries.  kimbrell was unable to fully reach townsend for assessment due to the position of the damaged guarding, so he asked shamblin, who arrived from working on the b-press, to hold townsend upright while he went around the machine.  shamblin held onto townsend’s shoulder, holding him upright while kimbrell ran around the machine.  phalen immediately went to call for help.  kimbrell switched places with shamblin and was unable to get a response or pulse from townsend.  gibson arrived from working on the b-press and was also unable to get a pulse from townsend.  townsend was suspended in a precarious position as he was pinned by the cylinder barrel and guarding beyond the walkway, suspended approximately 15 ½ feet above the concrete floor.malden fire department was notified at 4:04 p.m., and arrived on scene at 4:23 p.m.  upon arrival, the firemen quickly assessed townsend and found that he had no pulse and was unresponsive.  the county medical examiner arrived at 5:40 p.m., and recorded his time of death to be 4:28 p.m.  malden fire department carefully extricated townsend, utilizing an overhead crane in the press building to move damaged components.  upon extrication, townsend was transported by the kanawha county medical examiner and arrived at the office of the chief medical examiner in charleston, west virginia at 7:43 p.m.white awaited medical attention in the plant office.  assistance was provided to white by plant employees to help control bleeding.  white was transported by cedar grove fire department, to camc general hospital where he was treated and later released.

Virginia|Coal|CONSOL Energy Inc.|Coal (Bituminous)|2012-11-30T12:15:00-05:00|WestVirginia|WestVirginia|on friday, november 30, 2012, mike friedline, impoundment construction supervisor, started his day by conducting a pre-shift inspection of the nolan run slurry impoundment, msha impoundment site i.d. no. wv03-00161-00. he inspected the main embankment and western saddle dike prior to the other miners starting work. friedline did not note anything out of the ordinary at that time. the shift started with a safety meeting in the preparation plant prior to the miners going to their assigned work areas.koon was operating a caterpillar d6t low-ground-pressure model bulldozer (dozer), working on the main embankment of the impoundment. afterward, he moved the dozer to the western saddle dike to continue grading the upstream slope. daniel krivosky and mark wentz were operating pans used to transport the ccr from the refuse bin to the impoundment for placement. danny stonebreaker and craig carpenter were operating smooth-drum vibratory compactors, and joshua dean was operating various pieces of mobile equipment. later in the shift, stonebreaker used another dozer to start building up a berm along the downstream edge of the saddle dike. carpenter left the site to get the water pan.jeff cox, impoundment inspector, contracted through forquers contracting, arrived at the site at 10:00 am to complete a required seven-day impoundment inspection. cox recorded a pressure of 15 pounds per square inch (psi) on the p-7 pneumatic piezometer, located below the western saddle dike. since the reading was greater than the hydrostatic pressure acting alone on the instrument, it indicated that excess pore water pressures had developed. cox had been instructed to notify consol personnel if the piezometer reading showed excess pore pressure. this was the second consecutive weekly reading of the piezometer that indicated the pore water pressure was greater than the hydrostatic pressure. hydrostatic pressure is the pore water pressure that is due to the difference in elevation between the pool and point of measurement. p. stuart carter, project engineer for consol energy, was immediately notified of the reading and he traveled to the site.friedline met carter on the saddle dike at approximately noon. they parked their trucks near piezometer p-7. after discussing the piezometer reading, they walked to the edge of the upstream slope on the saddle dike near the water surface. carter noticed islands of fcr which had formed above the water surface in the pool, south of their location. friedline told carter that the islands were not present during his preshift inspection prior to 8:00 a.m. during carter and friedline’s inspection, approximately 15 feet out into the pool, the water started bubbling at the pool surface. carter informed friedline that the saddle dike was starting to settle and everyone needed to get off of it. suddenly, a large crack formed across the saddle dike behind piezometer p-7 and the pickup trucks as water sprayed into the air from the crack. miners operating equipment nearby felt a sudden jolt from the saddle dike area. koon radioed, “what was that?” the dozer koon was operating was located on the front slope of the dam with the front of the dozer pointed up toward the working surface. koon attempted to maneuver the vehicle out of the pool as it slid with the failed material into the pool area. the dozer eventually submerged with koon still in the cab. stonebreaker drove his dozer off the saddle dike onto natural ground. krivosky had just left the saddle dike in his pan and saw the events occurring in the pan’s mirror. dean witnessed the dam failure from an articulated haul truck near the emergency spillway on the main embankment and immediately called for help over the radio. both dean and krivosky returned to the saddle dike area as quickly as possible.friedline and carter looked up and saw a 12-to 15-foot-high, nearly vertical, slope of ccr in front of them and realized the section of the embankment where they were standing was sinking rapidly. the failure sent a wave of water to the other side of the impoundment. friedline and carter were not able to reach the remaining portion of the dike before being engulfed by water. friedline swam and waded to the southern corner of the remaining dike as it continued to break off. dean, krivosky and stonebreaker were able to pull him to safety. carter fell down as the water rushed around him. the momentum of the failed material and the current of the water carried him away from shore. he grabbed a wooden crib block to help him stay afloat. large slabs of the ccr embankment continued to fall into the pool. carter floated past his partially submerged pickup truck, from which he obtained a lifejacket. however, the momentum of the failure pushed carter farther toward the center of the impoundment, where he was able to climb onto material that had heaved above the water surface level. he was rescued by a boat operated by the winfield district volunteer fire department.

for the midnight shift. the report indicates that the examination took place between 9:00 p.m. and 9:50 p.m.prior to going underground, a brief safety meeting was conducted with the midnight shift crew. teddy alderman, evening shift mine foreman, told the crew about an incident that occurred on the evening shift, while he was helping the section electrician troubleshoot the cable on the roof bolting machine. alderman was standing in the no. 5 entry when a shuttle car approached and contacted his arm and leg. alderman was located in the shuttle car operator’s blind spot when contacted, but was able to stop the shuttle car by yelling at the operator. alderman was not injured, but he wanted to discuss with the crew the incident and dangers involved when working around mobile equipment.at approximately 10:35 p.m., the crew entered the mine and traveled to the no. 2 section. michael casey, section foreman, discussed portions of the mine’s approved roof control plan with the crew when they arrived on the section. casey went to conduct an examination of the section face areas. some miners from the previous shift (evening shift) crew remained on the section to install cutter drum bit inserts in the left side continuous mining machine and to grade bottom in the no. 7 entry. while casey was completing his examination, the midnight shift maintenance crew went to work on the section.harold fain, maintenance chief for no. 2 section, and shawn hamrick, electrician, went to the no. 1 shuttle car and began scheduled maintenance work on the machine. fain and hamrick remained at this location until they were notified of the accident. bernard king, utility man, trammed a battery scoop outby the section in the no. 3 entry, to obtain roof bolting supplies. king brought the supplies to the no. 4 entry and casey assisted him in loading the supplies onto the roof bolting machine. chris may and greg baker, utility men, were located three crosscuts outby the section power center, loading a rock dusting machine onto the section scoop. may and baker remained in this location until they were notified of the fatal accident. o’dell and aaron childers, apprentice electrician, loaded their tools onto the maintenance scoop, and traveled outby the section to get oil. childers operated the maintenance scoop as o’dell traveled by foot. the oil was needed for routine maintenance work on the left side continuous mining machine.o’dell and childers proceeded to the left side continuous mining machine in the no. 2 entry and began the maintenance work. they serviced the machine with hydraulic oil, heavy oil, and checked pressure on the water sprays. the majority of the work was completed and at approximately 12:10 a.m. o’dell went to the right-side continuous mining machine to begin cleaning bolt holes in the left side of the cutter drum. the machine was located in the no. 7 entry. childers remained at the left side continuous mining machine performing maintenance work.at approximately 1:00 a.m., frank mcmillion, midnight shift foreman, and robbie amick, preshift examiner, arrived on the no. 2 section with a hydraulic jack for a shuttle car and some parts for fain and hamrick. they went to the face area and met casey and king who were still loading supplies on the roof bolting machine in the no. 4 entry.o’dell began to clean the bolt holes on the continuous mining machine cutting drum, in preparation for the replacement of the offside cutter drum. in order to remove compacted material, o’dell needed a drill bit and returned to the no. 2 entry where childers was located at the maintenance scoop. childers had completed his maintenance work and o’dell instructed him to follow with the scoop to the right side continuous mining machine. the maintenance scoop was needed to service the continuous mining machine with hydraulic oil, heavy gear oil, and perform some welding. at approximately 1:19 a.m., childers was operating the maintenance scoop and following o’dell, who was walking in the no.6 entry. childers had trouble maneuvering the maintenance scoop through a low area in the no. 6 entry and saw o’dell walking through the crosscut from the no. 6 to the no. 7 entry.childers made it through the low area and trammed in reverse, leading with the battery end of the machine, through the crosscut between the no. 6 to 7 entries. childers operated the scoop through a set of ventilation curtains (fly pads) installed in the crosscut, toward the continuous mining machine in the no. 7 entry.as he traveled through the crosscut, childers noticed the illumination from the continuous mining machine’s lights, but was unable to see the machine. childers stated that he could not see o’dell, so he trammed slowly, waiting for o’dell to stop him. o’dell did not instruct childers to stop and the scoop then hit the continuous mining machine. childers reversed the direction of the scoop, away from the continuous mining machine cutter head, approximately 3 feet. childers exited the scoop, saw o’dell in a kneeling position and realized that he had hit him. o’dell told childers to call for an ambulance. childers ran to the section power center and notified fain and hamrick of the accident.fain immediately traveled to the no. 7 entry where o’dell was located. hamrick reported the accident by phone to henry utberg, surface dispatcher, at approximately 1:25 a.m. fain arrived at the accident scene and found o’dell lying on the mine floor. fain spoke to o’dell, but he did not reply back. fain placed o’dell’s head in his lap and begin to yell for help. after completing the call to the surface, hamrick used his radio to call mcmillion and amick, emergency medical technicians (emt), telling them to go to the accident site.casey, mcmillion, king, and amick arrived at the scene. amick asked that the first aid boxes be brought and the maintenance scoop moved so that another scoop and first aid supplies could be brought to the accident scene. casey traveled with mcmillion to the section power center where he retrieved a backboard and blankets. mcmillion notified baker and may of the accident, and instructed may to prepare the mantrip for transportation. baker and mcmillion then returned to the accident scene. casey and amick placed o’dell on the backboard and prepared him for transport. the maintenance scoop was moved out of the way, and king brought the other scoop to transport o’dell. baker returned to the power center, met may and they carried first-aid boxes to the scene. o’dell had been placed on the backboard and was being administered oxygen. o’dell was then placed in the bucket of the scoop and transported to the end of the track, where he was loaded onto a battery-powered mantrip.at approximately 1:53 a.m., mcmillion called on the mine phone for track clearance and operated the mantrip to the mine portal. the mantrip arrived on the surface at 2:15 a.m., and o’dell was transferred to quinwood emergency ambulance service. cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (cpr) was initiated at this time. o’dell was transported by ambulance to the greenbrier valley medical center in ronceverte, west virginia, where he was pronounced dead at 2:29 a.m.

Illinois|Coal|Peabody Energy|Coal (Bituminous)|2012-11-17T03:20:00-05:00|Illinois|Illinois|chad meyers, victim, reported to work on friday night, november 16th, for his normal 11:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. shift. meyers usually operated a scoop on the no. 1 unit. before going underground, meyers was assigned to operate the continuous mining machines on the no. 5 unit. typically two continuous mining machine operators are assigned to each working section, but on this shift, because of other miners being absent, meyers was the only continuous mining machine operator assigned to the no. 5 unit. he traveled underground with the no. 5 unit crew, arriving on the unit at about midnight.the shift proceeded without incident with meyers first operating the left side continuous mining machine, mining coal in the no. 7 entry. ram car operators arval van, kevin hawkins, and aaron hall transported the mined coal from no. 7 entry to the section feeder. after completing the cut in the no. 7 entry, meyers parked the left side continuous mining machine. roof bolting machine operators chris czuprynski and josh mcclendon began roof bolting the fresh cut in the no. 7 entry.meyers walked across the section to the face of the no. 3 entry. he began operating the right side continuous mining machine, mining the right crosscut off of the no. 3 entry at survey station 36+80. he mined the crosscut through into the no. 2 entry. van, hawkins, and hall again transported the coal from the continuous mining machine to the feeder. after finishing the cut, meyers backed the continuous mining machine out of the crosscut into the no. 3 entry. he then trammed the continuous mining machine through the crosscut between the no. 3 and no. 4 entries and started mining the left crosscut off of no. 4 entry at survey station 36+80. benji reeves, section foreman, and brian duty, lead man, moved the right side roof bolting machine into the crosscut between no. 3 and no. 2 entries and began roof bolting the fresh cut. czuprynski and mcclendon relieved reeves and duty and continued roof bolting in the crosscut.meyers mined the first cut of the left crosscut off of the no. 4 entry approximately 25-feet deep. the last coal mined from this cut was loaded into hawkins’ ram car. after hawkins’ car departed, meyers began backing the continuous mining machine out of the cut. van began tramming his ram car in the no. 3 entry toward the face. before turning left into the crosscut, van noticed meyers signaling with his cap lamp, which illuminated the inby rib of the crosscut. van could not see meyers or the cutter head of the continuous mining machine from his location. van assumed meyers was going to reposition the continuous mining machine to mine the right side of the cut. van stopped his ram car and waited for meyers to signal he was ready to commence mining. a short time later, van heard the continuous mining machine shut off.while czuprynski and mcclendon were still installing roof bolts in the right cross cut off of the no. 3 entry, mcclendon noticed the lights on the continuous mining machine were not illuminated. mcclendon thought the continuous mining machine had lost power and informed czuprynski of such. czuprynski turned and saw the rear-mounted methane monitor display illuminated, which indicated that the continuous mining machine still had power. neither czuprynski nor mcclendon could see the cutter head of the continuous mining machine from their location. they continued installing roof bolts.upon returning from the feeder, hall observed van’s ram car parked in the no. 3 entry. hall parked his ram car in the no. 3 entry one crosscut outby van’s ram car and walked up to van’s ram car. van and hall waited for meyers to signal them that he was ready to commence mining.hawkins returned from the feeder and parked his ram car behind hall’s ram car and walked up the no. 3 entry toward the face. hawkins walked inby van’s ram car to see why the continuous mining machine was not operating. he observed meyers pinned between the left side of the cutter head and the outby rib of the crosscut. hawkins immediately yelled for help. van ran to meyers, traveling up the left side of the continuous mining machine. meyers was facing toward the rear of the machine with one shoulder against the coal rib and the other shoulder against the side of the cutter head. van checked meyers for a pulse but found none.czuprynski ran around the coal block to the no. 4 entry and approached meyers from the front of the machine. he and van were unable to free meyers. mcclendon ran outby to get help. he encountered brian duty operating a scoop in the no. 7 entry and informed him of the accident. duty ran to the scene. van informed duty that the remote control unit was pinned between the continuous mining machine and the coal rib. duty attempted to operate the continuous mining machine manually by using the on-board controls. duty was able to start the pump motor but could not get the tram function to operate. duty informed van that he had to have the remote control unit. van freed the remote control unit and handed it to duty. at approximately 3:37 a.m., duty activated the right tram in reverse, which rotated the continuous mining machine’s cutter head away from the rib, freeing meyers.van and czuprynski moved meyers into the no. 4 entry. gary brasher, emt, arrived at the scene as meyers was freed and brasher immediately began cpr. meyers was not breathing and did not have a pulse. cpr was continued while meyers was placed in a mantrip and transported to the surface. meyers was pronounced dead on the surface at 4:40 a.m. by the saline county coroner.an autopsy was performed at the request of the saline county coroner’s office. the cause of death was asphyxiation due to thoracic compression due to blunt compression trauma.

Alabama|Coal|Drummond Company Inc|Coal (Bituminous)|2012-09-11T10:15:00-04:00|Alabama|Alabama|on september 11, 2012, the day shift began at 7:00 a.m. julius walker iii (victim), the production crew, and other personnel assigned to the i-0 longwall section entered the mine. walker, ray jordan, outby utility man, and paul gilbert, outby utility man boarded a personnel carrier operated by frank benson, outby foreman, and proceeded toward the i-0 longwall section. prior to arriving on the longwall section, jordan and gilbert were dropped off at two diesel forklifts, which were utilized to lift and move heavy components in the mine. they were instructed to conduct pre-operational checks and prepare the forklifts for the assignments of the day. benson and walker continued inby to the longwall section. walker, gilbert, and jordan were commonly assigned to move large components in the mine on the day shift.the i-0 longwall section is a three entry mining section (headgate), numbered left to right. the #1 entry is an isolated intake belt entry and the secondary escapeway. the #2 entry is a roadway and the primary intake escapeway. the #3 entry is an intake entry, common with the #2 entry.mining operations on the i-0 longwall section proceeded normally, and other outby work was performed by walker, gilbert, and jordan under benson’s supervision. at approximately 10:00 a.m., gilbert and jordan traveled to crosscut #33 in the i-0 longwall section roadway to prepare to move a spare power center to crosscut #27. benson and walker also arrived to assist in the hook-up and initial movement of the power center into the roadway. this power center is a large longwall component measuring approximately 30 feet in length, 9 feet in width, 6 ½ feet in height, and weighing approximately 30 tons. after hooking gilbert’s forklift (company number 5723) to the power center with a single large pull chain, walker backed out of the way. gilbert pulled the power center into the roadway and jordan moved his forklift (company number 5706) behind the power center to assist in the moving process primarily by lifting the power center to reduce the drag on the outby forklift. gilbert and jordon began moving toward crosscut #27 with the power center.benson instructed walker to check with the longwall face crew to see if anyone needed to be relieved for lunch. walker walked up the roadway toward the longwall face area, a few crosscuts inby his location. benson, driving his personnel carrier, followed the forklifts moving the power center toward crosscut #27.after walker checked with the crew, he determined that he was not needed to relieve anyone for lunch. he walked back down the roadway toward the area where the power center would be placed. walker joined gilbert, jordan, and benson at crosscut #28, where they had stopped to observe a hill over which the power center had to be moved. walker then proceeded up the hill to crosscut #27.at approximately 10:15 a.m., gilbert’s machine began pulling the power center to the final location, being assisted by jordan’s machine. as gilbert reached crosscut #27, he turned left toward the #3 entry. this presented a problem because the designated location was near the crest of a hill, and a step-up in the mine floor approximately 10 inches in height was present at the inby corner of the intersection entering the crosscut. as gilbert pulled into the crosscut, his forklift became wedged in a fully articulated left turn against the outby coal rib. attempts to straighten the machine with the hydraulic steering were unsuccessful. gilbert attempted to move his machine toward the power center to produce slack in order to unhook the chain. benson walked up the hill and into the crosscut beside the operator’s compartment of gilbert’s forklift. walker approached on the outby side of the power center and attempted to unhook the pull chain to allow gilbert to straighten his machine and get a better pull on the power center. after attempts by walker to unhook the chain were unsuccessful, walker proceeded back toward the roadway, out of sight of all other personnel at this location. benson, gilbert, and jordan stated they could see the light from walker’s cap lamp (though not the actual beam), which indicated to them that walker was on the outby side of the power center.jordan had shifted his machine to the neutral position with the parking brake set waiting for gilbert to resume pulling the power center. jordan’s forklift had the power center lifted approximately 10 inches off the mine floor, resting on the forks of the machine. he was sitting in the operator’s compartment, looking toward the back of the machine at the water scrubber. the corner of the power center closest to the left side of the roadway was approximately 18 inches from the coal rib.benson instructed gilbert to set his machine over. this is a commonly used maneuver conducted by lifting the front wheels off the ground by lowering the forks of the machine, and then using the hydraulic steering jacks to straighten the machine. unknown to the other members of the move, walker had positioned himself between the power center and the coal rib. as gilbert performed this maneuver, he was able to straighten his machine in line with the power center. while straightening the forklift, the power center shifted on the forks of jordan’s machine causing it to slide toward the left coal rib. jordan, looking toward the back of his machine, felt the machine shake as a result of the power center moving on his forks. at approximately, 10:22 a.m., he looked back toward the power center and recognized that it had shifted on his forks, and was shocked to see walker pinned against the coal rib with the corner of the power center against his chest. jordan immediately yelled, “we got julius!” and steered his machine to the left, moving the power center away from the coal rib. jordan was the first to get to walker’s location, immediately followed by benson and gilbert. walker was unresponsive and did not have a pulse. cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) was immediately started. benson instructed gilbert to turn both machines off and to call the control room operator for help.at approximately 10:25 a.m., gilbert turned the machines off and called the control room operator (justin sherer) from his handheld radio. he informed sherer of the accident and requested help. at approximately 10:26 a.m., sherer notified life saver air ambulance and regional paramedical services requesting their assistance.hearing gilbert’s call for help over the radio, other personnel traveled to the accident scene with first aid equipment. recognizing walker had obvious and extensive trauma from the accident and was in cardiac arrest, he was moved to a backboard and loaded onto a personnel carrier. walker was transported to camp creek portal with cpr being performed during transit.at approximately 10:43 a.m., walker and the rescuers arrived on the surface. they were met immediately by a flight nurse and flight paramedic from the air ambulance. advanced life-saving procedures were initiated. additional paramedics from the ground units arrived a short time later, and after extensive efforts to revive walker failed, orders to stop were given by the medical control physician. a walker county deputy coroner arrived and pronounced walker dead at 12:28 p.m.

shifter/foreman, assigned campbell to go to the 4500-315 stope to prepare for the next set of holes to be drilled.shortly after 7:00 a.m., campbell entered the mine on a tractor and traveled down to the 4410-307 stope to assist zach wright, driller, who was working on his drill. campbell then traveled to the 4500-315 stope. he inspected the area and noticed the shot material had bridged over the hole. campbell called keogh to inform him of the condition and keogh headed to examine the 4500-315 stope.before keogh arrived, campbell and robert kennedy, loader operator, who was backfilling in the 4500-311 stope, went in the 4500-315 stope to look at the bridged material. both men went down to the 4410-315 level to check the bottom and then went back up to the 4500-315 stope. kennedy left and campbell went to meet keogh.keogh arrived about 8:00 a.m. to examine the stope. keogh and campbell decided to measure back from the location of the last blasted drill holes and mark the rib. this mark would correspond to where the next set of holes would be drilled and would delineate the lines for subsequent mucking. before keogh left, he instructed campbell to apply water to the bridged material to try to move it. he also told campbell to have the mucking crew muck from below the stope.at approximately 8:30 a.m., campbell called kennedy to clean the floor in preparation for drilling. kennedy drove a mucker into the drift and began pushing the material forward to clear the floor for the next set of drill holes. during this process, kennedy positioned the mucker bucket with its front tilted down, allowing him to find the edge of the stope.kennedy finished cleaning the floor of the 4500-315 stope and returned to the 4500-311 stope to continue backfilling. keogh returned to the stope at approximately 9:30 a.m. and went with campbell to locate another mucker to clean up. between 9:45 a.m. and 10:00 a.m., kennedy observed campbell return with a mucker. about 11:00 a.m., kennedy went to check on campbell because he did not see the mucker's lights moving in the 4500-315 stope. kennedy stated he observed a miner's cap light shining in front of the mucker and returned to his work area.steve kranovich, mechanic, and david edson, drill operator, arrived on the 4500-315 level and met with keogh. kranovich told keogh he was there to talk to campbell about working on the drill. kranovich then went to the 4500-315 stope to check on campbell but could not locate him.about 12:00 p.m., keogh returned to the 4500-315 stope to check on campbell and met kranovich. keogh observed campbell's mucker parked in the heading of the 4500-315 stope and noticed a hose stretched down into the open stope hole, but did not see campbell. keogh went up to the 4500-319 stope to see if campbell was working in that area. he found campbell's tractor but could not locate campbell. keogh asked kennedy if he had seen campbell.kranovich and edson walked back into the 4500-315 stope to look for campbell but did not find him. they noticed an open hole, 3 to 4 feet in diameter, had developed in the bridged material and found a 1-inch water hose laying over the edge of the open hole with water running in it. keogh asked other miners in the area if they had seen campbell but they had not seen him.wright arrived, donned fall protection, and went into the 4500-315 stope to look over the edge but did not see campbell. edson called thomas cruce, mucker operator, who was working at the bottom of the open stope hole on the 4410-315 level, to immediately stop mucking. keogh and wright went to the 4410-315 level and met cruce. cruce told them he did not see campbell but stated a truck had just recently been loaded. keogh ordered an immediate evacuation of the mine and called to the surface to stop all trucks from dumping.the mine was evacuated and a search of the surface started. at approximately 1:40 p.m., campbell was located on top of the high grade ore pile. he was checked but was nonresponsive. the ambulance crew arrived at approximately 2:45 p.m. campbell was pronounced dead by kenneth jones, eureka county sheriff. the cause of death was attributed to traumatic asphyxia.msha received notification that a miner was missing at 1:57 p.m. on august 31, 2012, by a telephone call from doug nelson, newmont health safety and loss control, to msha's national call center. the national call center notified james fitch, western district safety specialist. msha issued an order under the provisions of 103(j) of the mine act to ensure the safety of the miners. this order was later modified to 103(k) of the mine act when the first authorized representative arrived at the mine.

conducted by the midnight shift on tuesday, july 31, 2012. the examination record indicated the no. 1 and no. 6 entries were not bolted, the no. 4, 5, and 8 entries needed to be cleaned and dusted, and no hazards were reported for entries 2, 3, and 7. the examination report was phoned outside to john morefield, day shift section foreman, by james farnsworth, pre-shift examiner, at 5:45 a.m. the report indicated the examination took place between 4:00 a.m. and 4:40 a.m.prior to going underground, a brief safety meeting was held and donnie crum was introduced as the new general mine foreman. the crew entered the mine at 6:24 a.m., and traveled to the no. 2 section. upon arrival on the no. 2 section, jonathan morefield, section foreman, discussed portions of the ventilation plan and the roof control plan with the crew, and then conducted an imminent danger run of the section prior to producing coal. the crew went to their respective pieces of equipment while waiting for morefield to complete his examination.byers was performing his daily routine of checking roof bolting supplies, cleaning and rock dusting the face areas, and picking up trash on the section. morefield then instructed byers to change the batteries on the no. 8 fairchild scoop. the mine communication and tracking system indicates that byers was in the no. 3 face at approximately 12:40 p.m., and at 12:45 p.m. he arrived at or near the no. 8 scoop charging station.david thompson, scoop operator for the outby support crew, was operating the no. 11 fairchild scoop. he had just completed rock dusting the left return aircourse of no. 2 section and was traveling off the section to retrieve additional rock dust. as he was traveling through temporary ventilation controls (curtains), located in the number 3 entry near the section dumping point, thompson raised the scoop's batteries to prevent a curtain from being torn down. he then continued to tram outby the section in the no. 3 entry roadway. thompson was tramming the no. 11 scoop in reverse (battery end first) as he approached the no. 8 scoop battery charging station. the charging station was located in a crosscut off of the no. 3 entry. the no. 3 entry roadway was slightly up-grade, toward the battery charging station, and traveling in a reverse direction with the batteries raised made it more difficult to see the no. 8 scoop.at approximately 12:48 p.m., thompson approached the scoop charging station and observed what he thought was the center section of the no. 8 scoop. thompson stated he was approximately 45 feet (½ of a crosscut distance) from the charging station and he did not see byers or the scoop bucket extended out into the no. 3 entry roadway. thompson attempted to steer his scoop away from the parked scoop, but impacted and pushed the no. 8 scoop. thompson immediately stopped his machine and upon seeing byers, attempted to communicate with him, but did not get a response. thompson realized that byers was pinned between the scoop canopy and the coal rib. thompson moved his scoop out of the way and ran back to assess the condition of byers. byers was not moving or talking. thompson immediately called the no. 2 section for help and proceeded to free byers from being pinned. thompson plugged the battery cables into the parked scoop, energized the machine while standing outside the operator's compartment, and put downward pressure on the scoop bucket and steered the machine. this motion allowed the center section of the scoop to pivot away from the coal rib, freeing byers. upon being freed, byers collapsed. thompson caught byers and leaned him onto the side of the scoop.morefield and brian farley, section electrician, then arrived at the accident scene at approximately 1:00 pm. morefield called for the section's emergency medical technicians (emts) and supplies to be brought to the accident scene, and reported the accident by phone to elmer billups, surface dispatcher, at approximately 1:05 p.m. farley assisted thompson in moving byers over to the no. 3 entry roadway. at some point byers revived, and after byers was moved to the roadway, he complained that he could not breathe. then byers collapsed again. thompson, an emt, stabilized byers and instructed farley to treat byers for shock. at this time, yubrenal isabelle, roy smith, rodney smith, jonah clark, and jeff varney, all emts from the section, arrived with first aid equipment and provided assistance. isabelle assessed byers' condition and administered oxygen because byers was having difficulty breathing. byers was placed on a stretcher and at approximately 1:10 p.m., as indicated by the mine tracking system, transported to the shaft bottom on a diesel rubber-tired personnel carrier. he was transported via mine elevator and arrived on the surface at approximately 1:39 p.m., where jan-care ambulance personnel were waiting and transported byers to raleigh general hospital in beckley, west virginia. the victim was then transported via life flight helicopter to charleston area medical center. byers was pronounced dead at 6:15 pm.

10 mine began their regular shift. kevin parsley, section foreman, and the no. 2 section maintenance crew comprised of jeff farris, nick hensley, james bryant, ruban carroll, jason freeman, george hignite, brian ball, daniel gillispie, and johnny mack bryant entered the mine and traveled from the surface to the no. 2 section in the track entry via a battery-powered mantrip.the crew began the shift by preparing for a belt move which included cleaning and rock dusting the no. 2 section. parsley instructed bryant, electrician, and jason freeman, general laborer, to move the right roof bolting machine from the 4 left crosscut outby to the no. 3 belt entry to install belt hangers for the belt move. parsley and hignite, general laborer, moved the no. 16 joy continuous mining machine from the no. 4 face area, down the no. 5 entry, to the first connecting crosscut between the no. 4 and no. 5 entries, one break outby the face area, and parked it in the crosscut adjacent to and approximately 35 feet from survey spad no. 1819. the machine was moved to this area so service work could be performed.parsley and the general laborers of the crew started lunch at approximately 3:20 a.m., while the electricians turned the power off to the section power center in order to replace an electrical panel for a shuttle car in the section power center. at approximately 3:55 a.m., the power was restored to the section power center and the general labor crew returned to work. parsley and bryant traveled to the no. 16 continuous mining machine to move the machine from the 4 right crosscut. sections of nylon rope, approximately three feet in length, were attached intermittently to the continuous mining machine’s cable to aid in pulling slack in the cable. these ropes are looped, or attached, to a hook on the mining machine’s boom as needed to pull the cable along as the machine is being moved from place to place.at approximately 4:11 a.m., after attaching four nylon ropes to the conveyor boom hook, parsley instructed bryant that there was one more nylon rope to be attached to the boom (one section of cable slack remained to be picked up). after parsley moved the continuous mining machine back enough to reach the cable rope, bryant could attach the rope to the conveyor boom. parsley instructed bryant to get in the clear. bryant then walked away from the area and into the adjacent no. 4 entry through a set of ventilation control curtains. this placed him away from any hazard related to the continuous mining machine and out of the sight of parsley. using the remote control transmitter, parsley began tramming the continuous mining machine, located in the 4 right crosscut, while standing near the cutting head. he moved the machine in reverse toward the ventilation control curtain located in the 4 right crosscut.during this move, two loops of continuous mining machine cable used to supply electrical power to the continuous mining machine, slid under the continuous mining machine conveyor pan. parsley briefly stopped tramming the continuous mining machine in order to move the cable from beneath the pan. as he bent over, he inadvertently shut down the continuous mining machine with the remote control. this caused the hydraulic pump motor of the continuous mining machine to de-energize for a very brief period while the cable was moved.parsley then restarted the continuous mining machine (at approximately 4:20 a.m.) and resumed moving the machine. shortly thereafter, as the machine began to move, he heard bryant faintly yell. parsley moved to where he could see bryant and observed that he was pinned between the boom of the continuous mining machine and the coal rib. parsley immediately moved the continuous mining machine freeing bryant. bryant fell to the ground with a nylon rope still in his hand.parsley immediately went for help and phoned rodney nelson, 3rd shift mine foreman, located at the section belt head, and mark grigg, communication person, located on the surface to inform him of the accident and request that he call 911. emergency medical technicians (emt’s), nick hensley and james bryant, administered first aid while being assisted by rodney nelson, mine foreman, and ruban carroll, jeff farris and brian ball, general laborers. bryant was administered cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (cpr) and was placed on a back board for transportation. he was taken to the end of the track, placed on a battery powered personnel carrier and immediately transported to the surface. nelson, hensley, james bryant, and brian ball traveled to the surface with bryant. cpr was continuously administered until the ambulance service attended to the victim.at approximately 4:28 a.m., the lincoln ems, station 20, unit 44, was dispatched to the fork creek #10 mine. the ambulance service left the mine site with bryant and was routed to the thomas memorial hospital in charleston, west virginia, where he was pronounced dead by the attending physician.

Inc|Coal (Bituminous)|2012-03-23T21:30:00-04:00|Alabama|Alabama|"on march 23, 2012, the evening shift for the mine began at 3:00 p.m. harold ennis (victim) and the production crew entered the mine and traveled to the west main left section to begin mining activities. the west main left section is a continuous mining machine unit that was developing four of eight entries in the west mains of the mine (see map no. 2). after doing other work, ennis, jimmy moore, jr., electrician trainee, and orbie burleson, day shift outby electrician, started the process of removing and installing a new cable reel (see photo no. 1) on joy shuttle car no. 17441. the old cable reel was removed during the day shift by electricians mike green, travis guthrie, and orbie burleson. the shuttle car, no. 17441, remained without power, locked and tagged out by green. the shuttle car was located in the no. 4 entry between crosscut 87 and crosscut 88.mining operations proceeded normally. after the new cable reel was brought to west main left section, ennis, moore, and burleson (under supervision of maintenance foreman, bill shaw) began prep work for installation of the new cable reel. burleson, who had worked over into the evening shift, helped prepare the shuttle car inner machine cable for entrance into the junction box. shaw then transported burleson to the personnel elevator to exit the mine, at approximately 7:00 p.m. while shaw was away, moore and ennis entered the inner machine cable into the junction box, and moore then spliced the trailing cable to the cable reel. after returning to the west main left section, shaw installed the cable reel drive chain, while moore and ennis were on their lunch break. moore wired the cable reel after lunch, with ennis observing. at this time, the leads in the junction box were spliced temporarily. the shuttle car cable reel was now ready to be tested for correct electrical rotation.ennis walked to the section coal feeder, the power source for the shuttle car, removed the lock and tag left in place by the day shift electrician, and energized shuttle car no. 17441. shaw got into the shuttle car operator's compartment, turned the pump motor on, and raised the conveyor boom to check electrical rotation of the shuttle car's pump motor. the electrical rotation was determined to be correct and the cable reel was determined to be spinning in the correct direction. at this time, moore was standing next to the cable reel compartment, and ennis was walking toward the shuttle car, approximately 50 feet away. shaw exited the shuttle car operator's compartment and asked ennis what tools he would need to complete the job. ennis responded and then asked shaw to ""knock"" (de-energize) the on-board breakers on the shuttle car. shaw de-energized the on-board circuit breakers on the shuttle car, informed ennis that he had done so, and went to his maintenance vehicle to get the tools. ennis then climbed into the shuttle car's cable reel compartment and began cutting electrical tape off of one of the energized 950 volt cable leads. ennis did not de-energize the shuttle car's power at the section feeder and did not install his lock and tag to assure power was locked out.moore, who was standing next to the shuttle car, spoke to ennis and noticed ennis was non-responsive. moore looked inside the cable reel compartment and saw ennis' knife in contact with the cable lead. at this time, approximately 9:30 p.m., moore ran to the section feeder and de-energized all shuttle car circuit breakers. meanwhile, shaw had returned to the shuttle car and found ennis unresponsive. shaw checked ennis for a pulse and found none. moore returned, passed the shuttle car in the direction of the section dinner hole, and yelled for help. dave bailey, maintenance foreman, and john bevins, section foreman, went to the shuttle car to give assistance. bevins went back to the section dinner hole and called paul moore, control operator, informing him of the accident, and also told him to call for a life saver helicopter.shaw and bailey removed ennis from the cable reel compartment and started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr). lee dodd, shuttle car operator and licensed emt, arrived and requested an automated external defibrillator (aed). dodd continued cpr and used the aed, once it was obtained. the victim was loaded onto a backboard, placed in a maintenance vehicle, and transported to the elevator. resuscitation attempts on ennis were continued and dodd used the aed two additional times while in route to the elevator. once outside, the victim was transported to the helicopter pad. the helicopter flight nurse informed dodd and shaw to discontinue cpr. the walker county coroner arrived at the mine site and pronounced the victim dead. an ambulance had also arrived at the site and transported the victim for an autopsy, at the coroner's instructions. the autopsy was performed by alabama department of forensic sciences. the cause of death was determined to be electrocution."

Virginia|Coal|CONSOL Energy Inc|Coal (Bituminous)|2012-01-11T19:40:00-05:00|Virginia|Virginia|"on january 11, 2012, joe e. saunders received traumatic head and face injuries when a pressurized water delivery manifold separated, striking him in the head. the accident occurred at approximately 7:40 p.m., while saunders and fellow co-worker david green were transporting a shuttle car along the track haulageway. green operated the lead diesel locomotive with saunders operating the tail diesel locomotive. a freedom shuttle car was positioned on a rail-mounted lowboy hauler connected to the rear of the lead locomotive and to the front of the tail locomotive, forming a ""haulage trip."" greg addington, first class mine foreman, was riding in the passenger seat of the tail locomotive and had been assigned to supervise these miners during the shift.the day shift had brought the lowboy and shuttle car (haulage trip) from the page portal and parked it at the 8 left side track off the 4 north mains, allowing the shift change mantrip traffic to clear. green, saunders, and addington met at the haulage trip lowboy and made preparations to continue transporting the shuttle car via the haulage trip to the 21st right panel off 3 east mains. the miners drove the haulage trip approximately 10,300 feet along the 4 north mains and the 3 east mains track, arriving at crosscut #61.as the haulage trip proceeded through crosscut #61 intersection, the shuttle car struck the tip of the manifold, dislodging a component of the 1 ½-inch valve from the valve body. the electrical panel board of the shuttle car protruded 38 inches from the left track rail, because of insufficient clearance for safe transport through the area. when the water valve was dislodged, water was sprayed into the air, wetting saunders and addington.green and saunders drove the haulage trip through this area and stopped the trip just inby the broken water outlet. green traveled on foot approximately five crosscuts inby to crosscut #66, where he closed a cut-off valve in the 6-inch water supply line to stop the flow of water. saunders exited his locomotive and traveled on foot outby to crosscut #58¾, where he also closed a cut-off valve to stop the flow of water in the 6-inch water line. saunders then traveled on foot back to crosscut #62, where he turned the cut-off lever of the 6-inch crossover pipe toward the ""off"" position. he believed he was stopping the flow of water from the 10-inch water line located in the adjacent #4 entry (see appendix a). according to interview statements, addington was wet and traveled on foot into the right crosscut, between the #5 and #6 entries in crosscut #61, to stay out of the air current.green and saunders met at the cutoff valve located at crosscut #62. during the interview process, green stated he observed saunders cutting off the crosscut #62 valve. green stated he observed saunders reach down, push it over and tap it with his hammer to where it should have been closed. after the crosscut #62 crossover valve was turned by saunders, green and saunders traveled outby to the crosscut #61 to investigate the broken water outlet and repair it. both green and saunders examined the water outlet and found that the first quarter turn ball valve, which was connected to the 1 ½-inch nipple on the supply line, had separated into two pieces. the separation occurred when the brass tailpiece of the ball valve was pulled out of the brass valve body. the tailpiece is provided with male fine threads and is threaded into the female fine-threaded body of the ball valve. the tailpiece remained on the 1 ½-inch diameter nipple of the six-inch supply pipe. the tailpiece of the valve is attached to the supply nipple by a coarse threaded connection (see appendix b). the water expelled from the dislodged outlet formed a pool of water, combined with mine dust and gravel covering the nipple. green and saunders used their hands to clean the loose mine dust and gravel from around the nipple to prepare for re-connection, but never visually observed the nipple or the tailpiece of the valve. the pool of water remained around the nipple due to a slight steady flow of water being expelled from the nipple. according to witness statements, the miners believed the water was residual water in the line and did not realize they had a supply line valve that was not fully closed. because of the pooling water, they were unable to gain a clear view of the nipple and valve tailpiece. they attempted to evaluate the condition of the threads by touching them with their hands. they visually evaluated the threads within the body portion of the ball valve for damage. the miners believed the threads on both components were still in usable condition.green and saunders began by disconnecting the 2-inch victaulic® water pipe connection from the manifold to enable them to turn the manifold onto the tailpiece and nipple. the two miners turned the manifold and ball valve onto the tailpiece and nipple to re-thread the two components back together. according to witness statements, they turned the manifold multiple times by hand before saunders tightened the manifold with a pipe wrench. during this process water continued to flow through the nipple into the manifold and out through the open outlets. water was allowed to flow through to reduce pressure on the manifold as they turned the manifold onto the tailpiece and nipple. according to witness statements, addington did not participate, nor provide any supervision or guidance to the miners related to the repair of the damaged fire valve.after installing the manifold, green stood and turned away from saunders to speak with another miner standing behind him. billy davis, utility person, helped saunders complete the connection of the 2-inch victaulic® line leading to the rock dust distribution machine, located in the adjacent crosscut. prior to making the victaulic® connection, the previously separated ball valve was placed in the closed position to stop the flow of water.with the 1 ½-inch ball valve closed, pressure began to build in the six-inch line, due to a partially closed valve still allowing water to flow in the line. as the pressure increased, the threaded connection between the valve tailpiece and the valve body failed at the location of the repair. this caused the manifold to again separate from the nipple and valve tailpiece, striking joe saunders in the face and head. the manifold then traveled through the air and landed 23 feet and 4 inches from its original location. saunders suffered serious lacerations to his face and forehead and lost consciousness at the time of impact. emergency responders evaluated saunders' vital signs, confirmed he had a pulse, was breathing, and then took action to control bleeding. greg smith, assistant shift foreman, and billy davis placed saunders on a backboard and transported him to the contrary portal hoist via a rail mounted mantrip. addington stated in interviews that during this time he was in communication with the surface to ensure that proper medical arrangements had been made and communicating with personnel in the mine to ensure the track way was clear for transportation of the injured miner. emergency evacuation plans were being made on the surface, but due to adverse weather conditions, air transport was not an option. upon arrival on the surface, saunders was transported by ambulance to nearby clinch valley medical center in richlands, virginia. saunders was later transported to the bristol regional medical center (brmc) in bristol, tennessee. he was hospitalized in the intensive care unit at brmc for seven days before passing away on january 18, 2012, at 4:12 p.m. from injuries sustained in this accident."

(victim) arrived at the mine at 6:00 a.m., his usual starting time. sherwood carpooled to work with coworkers randy l. walker, crusher crew leader/loader operator, and joshua harmon, excavator operator. sherwood, walker, and harmon began the shift by performing their routine of plant and mobile equipment startup.at approximately 7:00 a.m., they began replacing a stacker conveyor beneath the screen plant and finished at approximately 8:00 a.m. the crew began processing material following the completion of the replacement of the stacker conveyor. walker returned to his front-end loader, feeding the crushing plant and loading trucks from finished material stockpiles. sherwood was stationed in the jaw crushing plant's viewing platform, operating the vibrating feeder with a remote on/off switch ensuring an even flow of material into the crusher. harmon returned to his excavator, sorting rip rap and loading trucks.work at the plant progressed normally until about 12:45 p.m. sherwood, who was stationed on the viewing platform, motioned to walker alerting him that a truck arrived for loading. walker drove the front-end loader to the truck, parked approximately 150 feet from the crusher, loaded the truck, and returned to the crusher area. walker could not see sherwood on the viewing platform where he was stationed. at that moment, harmon swung the excavator around and noticed that sherwood was not on the platform. harmon motioned to walker inquiring if he could see sherwood. walker responded that he could not.harmon climbed up onto the viewing platform in an attempt to locate sherwood and found him positioned head first inside the operating crushing chamber. walker ran to the control panel to shut down power to the crusher. walker telephoned chad t. fotusky, crusher foreman, to notify him of the accident. fotusky, who was not on site when the accident occurred, called for emergency medical services (ems). ems arrived at 1:01 p.m. and at 1:40 p.m., the victim was pronounced dead at the scene by the susquehanna county coroner. the cause of death was attributed to blunt force trauma.

Burke|Coal (Bituminous)|2011-12-07T07:33:00-05:00|Virginia|Virginia|"on wednesday, december 7, 2011, yonts began his shift at approximately 6:00 a.m. he was assigned to operate the pc 400 komatsu excavator that was parked in the redwine pit a short distance from the accident scene.the redwine pit had been mined around a point to a position that placed the active pit under overhead high voltage power lines. due to the power lines being in close proximity to the active working pit, blasting practices were modified to prevent fly rock from damaging the power lines. witness statements indicated that thirty (30) foot vertical holes were drilled, but only approximately half of the drill hole was loaded with explosives. this modified blasting practice resulted in the lower 15 feet of the highwall being fractured while the top 15 feet was left almost intact. the fractured lower portion of the highwall was exposed as the shot material was removed on the second shift of december 6, 2011. an unstable highwall condition was created through this process and the weak fractures in the lower 15 feet of the highwall caused a toppling effect on the upper 15 feet of solid rock in the highwall.john pennington, a second shift bulldozer operator working in the redwine pit, had observed a large vertical crack in the east-facing highwall. he indicated that upon further observation, there appeared to be a large ""chimney"" or column of rock containing vertical cracks on each side, possibly extending behind the column, and the rock at the toe of the column appeared fractured and weak. pennington contacted timothy wright, second shift foreman, who examined the highwall and determined it to be unstable. wright removed all miners from the area and had the area partially bermed with earthen material to prevent entry. the berm was reported to be 15 feet high by 40 feet in length, and was constructed of shot material pushed up by a bulldozer around the unstable highwall area. according to interview statements, the earthen material berm ramped down on one end and created an access area to the highwall. wright made an entry in his on-shift record book stating, ""a bad place came in wall bermed off."" wright did not post warning signs around the area that had been inadequately barricaded by the berm.the second shift normally ended at 2:00 a.m., and the day shift began at 6:00 a.m. the normal procedure used to communicate between shifts was a cell phone voice mail message left for the day shift superintendent by the second shift foreman. according to wright, the voice mail message left after the december 6, 2011, second shift did not include any warning of the unsafe highwall or of an area ""bermed off."" the message detailed production and equipment breakdowns.on december 7, 2011, at approximately 6:00 a.m., the day shift crew began work in the redwine pit. witness statements from george steele, day shift foreman, and daniel short, day shift superintendent, indicated that they conducted a pre-shift examination of the redwine pit area before the day shift began, due to heavy rain the night before. the examination was conducted before daylight and handheld lights and equipment lights were used to illuminate the highwall. no hazardous conditions were detected during the examination. steele stated that short assigned him work in other areas of the mine, and steele did not return to the redwine pit before the accident. steele stated he overheard short make the excavator operator aware of a crack in the highwall, and told him he would examine the area once it was daylight. short did not return to the pit area until after the accident occurred.witness statements indicated yonts was instructed by short to start loading shot material into the haul trucks from the redwine pit using the pc 400 komatsu excavator. a komatsu wa 900 front-end wheel loader and a caterpillar 992-g front-end wheel loader were normally used to load shot material into haul trucks. both of these loaders had been out of service for several shifts because they needed mechanical repairs. due to both rock loaders out of service, a komatsu wa 600 coal loader was used to load haul trucks on the second shift on december 6, 2011. the komatsu wa 600 coal loader also incurred a mechanical breakdown and was taken out of service on the second shift. wright instructed john davis, loader operator, to operate the komatsu pc 400 excavator for the remainder of the second shift to load the haul trucks from the redwine pit. all the loaders were still unavailable when the day shift began working in the redwine pit on december 7, 2011, and yonts was assigned to load rock with the excavator on the day shift.according to witness statements, short give directions to yonts regarding how the excavator needed to be oriented to load the shot material, where to start loading and how to position the haulers to be loaded. yonts maneuvered the excavator up a ramp onto the shot material and started loading haul trucks shortly after 6:00 a.m. yonts positioned the excavator with the cab adjacent to the highwall face at the far end of the redwine pit, backing toward the partially bermed section of highwall as he loaded trucks.the attempt to isolate and danger off the hazardous highwall on the previous shift consisted solely of pushing an earthen berm around the bad section of highwall. no other barricades or warning signs were used. the berm was not recognized by the oncoming shift as a barrier to prevent entry into an area with a hazardous condition. witness statements revealed the day shift crew began work before steele or short reviewed the on-shift book completed by wright.delbert porter, bulldozer operator, was also working in the redwine pit pushing shot material in front of the excavator. at 7:33 a.m., while backing up the bulldozer, porter observed the highwall raveling and attempted to contact yonts by cb radio. before contact could be made, the highwall fell on the excavator, resulting in fatal injuries to yonts. porter called short and steele by cb radio, notifying them of the accident, and requesting that they come to the pit.upon arriving in the pit, short contacted larry gannaway, an office employee, instructing him to call 911. steele examined yonts and did not detect any vital signs. an inspector and acting supervisor with the mine safety and health administration (msha) were traveling to a nearby mine when they saw an ambulance entering mine property. they called the msha district 5 office, were briefed on the accident, and dispatched to the mine to secure the site. due to the instability of the highwall in the area of the excavator, an action plan was developed for safe recovery of the victim.the appalachia rescue squad ambulance arrived at the accident scene at 8:16 a.m. to assist in the recovery. due to the measures taken to remove the victim in a safe manner, yonts was removed from the excavator at 11:30 a.m. and transported by the rescue squad to wellmont lonesome pine hospital in big stone gap, virginia. the medical examiner's report states that yonts was pronounced dead at 12:28

Kentucky|Coal|Armstrong Energy Inc.|Coal (Bituminous)|2011-10-28T06:27:00-04:00|Kentucky|Kentucky|on friday, october 28, 2011, at 4:00 a.m., dwight d. lee, superintendent, jerry southard, supervisor, tommy williams, supervisor and roger smith, safety manager, met to discuss the day's work detail. at 4:20 a.m. lee, southard, and williams proceeded to the pit areas to conduct examinations. williams went to the east end of the #11 pit, lee to the west end of the #11 pit, and southard to the #14 pit. lee was in the #11 pit on two separate occasions prior to the accident. on four occasions, lee passed the section of highwall that failed. lee stated that he met winstead coming into the #11 pit to the drilled area in the west end. lee further stated this was when winstead would conduct a pre-shift examination of his work area as part of the routine as certified blaster. winstead returned to the staging area where the explosives truck and pump truck were located to meet with the miners that conducted blasting for the shift.at 5:30 a.m., winstead met with all the blasting company employees assigned to the day shift and gave them work orders. typically, the employees load their trucks with the supplies to be used and enter the #11 pit. donald thacker and kevin smith, blaster helpers, traveled to the pit and waited at the bottom of the ramp, which descends from the dragline bench into the #11 pit. winstead and lindsey entered the pit 20 minutes later and led a second truck, occupied by smith and thatcher, toward the drill bench of the #11 pit. once reaching the area next to the ramp close to the hitachi excavator/loader, operated by ricky phelps, winstead exited the ford f350 pump truck to look at the small ramp going up from the #11 coal seam to the rock bench above the #11 seam area. the ramp is approximately a six-foot incline to the east. witnesses stated winstead said he had trouble seeing the ramp because lights from the equipment in the pit were casting shadows on the pit floor and he wanted to make sure he was accessing the ramp properly.as winstead re-entered his truck, a rock, reported to be the size of a watermelon, fell into the pit. winstead attempted to maneuver the truck next to the excavator or to retreat out of the pit. additional rock began to fall, followed by massive rocks and boulders falling and covering the truck completely. according to witness testimony, only a couple of seconds elapsed between the first rock falling and the massive fall. the truck driven by smith was backed away when they saw the rock falling and the reverse lights from winstead's truck. the caterpillar 773 truck, driven by dustin southard, was struck by rock. southard was uninjured and exited the vehicle by the exit window and left the pit on foot.rock also struck the hitachi excavator occupied by rickey phelps, who was not injured. richard johnson was operating the caterpillar 988 wheel loader and was facing the truck driven by winstead. johnson and phelps were positioned to see the rocks from the highwall strike the truck carrying winstead and lindsey (victims). according to johnson, phelps, and other witnesses, there was no indication of any loose material in the highwall, nor had any material fallen during their time in the pit that morning. they further remarked the floor was clean and free of any rock.lee instructed smith to notify emergency services, the kentucky office of mine safety and licensing, (komsl), and msha. because of unstable highwall conditions, equipment was mobilized to begin scaling the highwall from the top. dave lander, an armstrong employee, positioned a komatsu pc800lc-8 excavator and started scaling the highwall. when loose material was removed, a caterpillar 992g loader was sent into the pit to remove material from the pit floor. this was done to gain access to the victims' truck and the hitachi excavator that phelps had operated.kenneth allen, executive vice president of operations for armstrong coal, ronnie drake, komsl district office supervisor, and ted smith, assistant district manager for msha, arrived on site to coordinate and facilitate recovery of the miners. at 9:10 a.m., a plan of action was formulated to continue recovery operations, using the 992 caterpillar loader working in the pit. at 9:33 a.m., the plan was modified to allow the excavator, operated by lander, to go back to the top of the highwall and pull/scale other loose material. at 9:52 a.m., the plan was modified further to allow lander to operate a hitachi ex1200 excavator in the pit to remove rock from around the hitachi excavator that phelps had been operating at the time of the accident. the excavator operated by phelps had experienced damaged hydraulic lines and could not be used to move material. once enough fallen rock was removed from this excavator, more space was provided to allow lander to begin removing rock that would recover the bodies of winstead and lindsey. the rock was removed and stacked to the side and occasionally was relocated further to the east in the pit by the caterpillar loader. the victims were recovered at 12:00 p.m. by rescue workers and pronounced dead

Kind|Mine No 1, Kentucky|Coal|Curtis Laws|Coal (Bituminous)|2011-10-07T02:00:00-04:00|Kentucky|Kentucky|the day shift crew produced normally on thursday, october 6, 2011, until approximately 1:50 p.m., when the conveyor chain on the inby jeffrey 94l bridge conveyor stuck. the operator of the machine, jonathon gray, bumped the conveyor several times with the controls, in an effort to free it.arnold hoskins, day shift foreman, was one crosscut outby and noted the problem. hoskins made his way up to the machine and asked gray to turn the mobile bridge carrier to the right and raise the bridge so he could look for the problem. gray had difficulty raising the bridge, but was able bump/wiggle the front boom, which raised the bridge. hoskins saw that the conveyor chain was broken on one side and called for the section repairman, verdie myers. hoskins had the area shoveled and rock dust scattered in an effort to dry the area where the repairs would be made. the inspection cover on the inby end of the bridge conveyor was removed to check the conveyor chain. the cover can be removed with the bridge conveyor resting on the mine floor.during repairs, the hydraulic boom jacks would not maintain the bridge conveyor in the raised position, which was attributed to the hydraulic pressure leaking. gray had to raise the bridge repeatedly, because it continued to drop back down. hoskins asked for crib blocks to use as props, but none of those present knew where they were located. brandon hatfield, continuous mining machine operator, picked up a piece of mined roof rock from on top of the bridge and hoskins stood it up under the inby end of the raised bridge conveyor.the bridge conveyor dropped until it was supported by the rock.myers came to the location and determined that the bridge conveyor chain was broken at the sprocket and he would need to cut out the chain and bent conveyor flights. when he hooked up the torches, myers discovered that the oxygen tank was empty. the day shift was nearly complete and it was decided to leave the repairs for the night shift.the night shift crew began assembling on the surface around 7:45 p.m. at approximately 8:52 p.m. mark sizemore, foreman, entered the mine to conduct the preshift examination. sizemore called the preshift results outside, and the night shift crew, consisting of richard coots, repairman, jeromy coots, roof bolter operator, chris collins, laborer and james lively, roof bolter operator, entered the mine at approximately 9:38 p.m. aboard the mantrip. due to mechanical problems with the mantrip, the crew did not arrive on the section until approximately 11:45 p.m. r. coots went to the bridge conveyor with the broken chain and began repair work on the machine. j. coots and lively went to the roof bolting machine. sizemore and collins went to a location approximately 6 crosscuts from the section and began installing a discharge line in preparation for setting a pump.after bolting the 4 right crosscut, j. coots and lively then attempted to move the roof bolter to the number 5 heading, but found there was not enough cable to reach. they decided to assist r. coots with the bridge conveyor repairs until receiving further instructions from sizemore. r. coots had removed several bent conveyor flights and a section of chain. he needed to pull the conveyor chain around to the top of the bridge conveyor in order to continue the repairs. lively went to the left side of the conveyor to assist r. coots with the repairs while j. coots ate lunch. r. coots passed the chain hoist under the bridge conveyor to lively. lively handed the hook end of the chain to r. coots and then attempted to pull the excess slack chain through the chain hoist. lively stated that he heard a thump and that the bridge conveyor fell suddenly, trapping r. coots j. coots heard the noise and turned to see what had happened. r. coots said to j. coots and lively, “get it off of me!” r. coots passed them a slate bar and said, “take this bar and get it off of me.” the bridge conveyor was too heavy to be lifted in this manner. j. coots was on the operator’s side of the mobile bridge carrier, but had never operated the machine and was unsure how to start it to raise the discharge boom and the attached bridge conveyor. lively, who had operated this machine previously, leaned across from the left side and gave j. coots instructions. lively and j. coots stated that the hydraulic pump motor would not start initially. after a period of elapsed time, the pump motor was started. however, when attempted, the boom would not lift. richard coots (victim) had become unresponsive. j. coots sent lively to call outside for an ambulance, obtained a larger chain hoist and attempted to hook it over a roof bolt plate, with the chain around the conveyor. the chain hoist kept slipping off of the roof bolt plate. j. coots told lively to continue to try to free the victim, while he went to get sizemore.j. coots signaled sizemore and collins with his cap lamp from some distance away and then yelled to them that r. coots was possibly injured fatally. upon arriving at the accident scene, sizemore attempted to pull the victim from beneath the bridge conveyor, but was unsuccessful. sizemore and collins then went for the section scoop machine to lift the bridge. while sizemore and collins were gone, lively retried the mobile bridge carrier and was able to joggle and raise the front boom. collins and j. coots removed the victim from beneath the bridge conveyor. the victim had no pulse and was not breathing. cpr was started on the victim by j. coots and collins and they transported him to the surface aboard the battery-powered mantrip.anthony brown, outside man, called curtis laws, mine manager, and informed him of the situation after receiving the call from lively. laws directed brown to call an ambulance and then to notify the mine safety and health administration (msha) via the hot line and to contact the kentucky office of mine safety and licensing (omsl).j. coots and collins arrived on the surface with the victim at approximately 2:40 a.m. and continued cpr until medical personnel from the neon (kentucky) fire and rescue service arrived at 2:53 a.m. while continuing to perform cpr, the ambulance attendants assessed the victim’s condition. the ambulance attendants ceased further attempts at resuscitation and called the letcher county coroner. the victim was pronounced dead at 4:10 a.m.

Wyoming|Coal|Peabody Powder River Operations LLC|Coal (Bituminous)|2011-09-01T10:36:00-04:00|Wyoming|Wyoming|"on july 15, 2011, hunt and three drilling crew members arrived at the mine in an attempt to free the pipe using a detonation cord method. this method involved using a tool to locate where the drill pipe connections were not loose, then dropping a blasting detonation cord with primer down the inside of the pipe to the deepest point possible, where the pipe was not loosening when reverse spin was applied. when this point was located, the driller would apply heavy torque in the reverse direction and the charge would then be set off allowing the pipe to disconnect at the lowest possible joint. this attempt was unsuccessful and the pipe remained stuck in the hole.on september 1, 2011, at approximately 8:05 a.m., brown and coworker, casey houston, arrived on the narm mine property. the two drillers traveled to the location of the drill rig #109, well site #26, and began preparing to free as much of the stuck pipe as could be saved. they conducted a work place examination of the drill area, which brown documented, and then started the drilling motors.at about 8:55 a.m., weston engineering, inc. engineer, jerry hunt and employee, william fulton, arrived at the mine to assist in the freeing of the drill pipe. soon thereafter, at about 9:00 a.m., tim bickett, general manager of goodwell incorporated, arrived at the mine. bickett had been contracted by weston engineering, inc. to detonate the blast.bickett dropped a tool, called a ""free point,"" down the inside of the drill pipe. the free point locates the deepest available pipe joint. the cord dropped to the 1,360 feet depth and located a joint. bickett then dropped the detonation cord in the drill pipe. the detonation cord dropped to 1,360 feet and torque was applied to the pipe in a reverse direction. hunt informed bickett that two, to three revolutions were going to be placed on the stuck drill pipe.hunt was operating the controls that rotated the drill pipes and brown and houston were assigned to place the tong wrench on the ""kelly,"" when the maximum torque was reached. the kelly is the square chuck that rotates the pipe during normal drilling and withdrawal of the pipe. houston attempted to place the tong wrench on the kelly, but the wrench failed to grip.brown replaced houston, stating he would get the wrench to hold. brown placed the tong wrench on the kelly and began to take a step out of the area. at the same time, hunt, seeing the wrench was in place, began to release pressure, applying torque to the drill pipes. the tong wrench began to rotate clockwise, with the release of pressure on the pipe, until the wrench reached the end of the tightening cable, referred to in the drilling industry as the ""snub line."" the snub line cable, in this application, is used to prevent the kelly and drill pipe from turning, thereby maintaining the torque.as hunt began to release the reverse rotation on the drill pipes, the tong rotated. the snub line length allowed the tong to travel past the optimum 90 degree angle. when the tong passed the 90 degrees, the snub line began to fail, which caused the tong to continue through its rotational arc, striking brown.investigationat approximately 1:14 p.m. on the day of the accident, dan vetter, msha district 9 staff assistant, received a call from the msha call center, informing him of an accident on narm property that resulted in death. vetter first called the mine and issued a verbal 103(j) order. vetter then called the gillette, wyoming field office and spoke with todd jaqua, field office supervisor. jaqua had assigned two inspectors to continue an e01 inspection at a nearby mine. jaqua called the inspectors and redirected them to the narm property.inspectors david hamilton and wayne johnson traveled to the narm site and assumed control of the scene. the 103(j) order was modified to a 103(k) order, denying any access to the accident scene without msha personnel being present. all drilling operations were ceased.an accident investigation team was assembled and traveled to the mine on september 2, 2011. the team met with narm management officials, weston engineering, inc. management, and the state of wyoming inspection personnel.during the physical investigation of the scene, a 107(a) order was issued to weston engineering, inc. stored energy was still present in the drill pipe when the tong wrench rotated and contacted the drill rig, stopping the release of torque. the energy was released under controlled methods and the 107(a) order was terminated.the accident scene was documented with photographs and measurements. after a physical examination of the scene, the team arranged to conduct interviews with the witnesses to the accident. interviews were conducted with persons known to have knowledge of the accident. a list of persons who participated in the investigation is contained in appendix a."

Inc|Coal (Bituminous)|2011-06-09T10:15:00-04:00|Colorado|Colorado|on june 9, 2011, at approximately 6:45 a.m., fred benally reported for the start of his shift at the rocky mountain steel trailer along with the others working on the construction crew. the other ironworkers were steve hoffbauer, wally martin, and narron martin (brothers). donald rule, rocky mountain steel's project manager, gave a short safety meeting and discussed the day's work activities. personal protective equipment (ppe), tie off with lanyards, and using flash guarding when welding was discussed during the safety talk.after the meeting, the ironworkers gathered their tools and proceeded to the second floor of the scalping tower construction site to start the day's activities. benally and n. martin began cutting the metal plate loose from the east side of the chute.w. martin and hoffbauer proceeded to weld the metal beams. the welding operations involved moving and repositioning a section of the floor grating near the chute. the floor grating was used as a work platform to weld the beams to the cross members. after completing the welding, hoffbauer left the second floor of the scalping tower and continued installing cross bracing on the north side of the tower extension. a mobile manlift was used for the higher locations.w. martin, n. martin, and benally continued working on the second floor using cutting torches to remove a metal plate on the east side of the chute. they installed a metal eye on the plate and connected the line from a crane to this eyelet. rule operated the crane to secure the load until the ironworkers could cut out the old chute.benally and n. martin continued cutting on the sides of the plate. the crew then used pry bars to loosen the plate, but it was still secured to the chute. the crew determined the plate was possibly still connected to the chute by some welds and bolts located near the bottom of the chute at the level of the second floor grating.benally climbed off the second floor and stood on an 11-inch wide steel beam, located below the floor level. he connected his right lanyard to a beam by using a clamp, and the left lanyard was secured to a steel cable running across the front (east) side of the second floor. benally cut the remaining welds and bolts that were believed to be holding the plate. he then used a hammer to dislodge the plate. the left lanyard, attached to the steel cable, interfered with this hammering and he disconnected it. the plate was loosened by the hammering and cutting. benally prepared to climb back to his work location on the second floor grating.benally apparently disconnected the lanyard connected to the beam and was in the process of reconnecting the lanyard to the steel cable when his right foot slipped off the beam. at approximately 10:22 a.m., from his limited view from the crane, rule saw benally's right foot slip and benally fall from the beam. rule stated, at that time, he saw benally with the lanyard in his hand. rule assumed benally was climbing up when he unhooked. benally fell approximately 8 feet and struck a 5–inch wide cross beam with his chest. benally flipped over this cross beam and landed on the conveyor dust cover, 32-inches below the top of beam.rule exited the crane when he saw benally land. when rule got to benally, he unlatched benally's harness. w. martin and n. martin descended from the second floor and rule told n. martin to go to the office near the breaker building and call for the emergency medical technicians (emt). rule walked around the conveyor structure to the north side to gain better access to benally. when rule arrived, benally was sitting up on the dust cover. rule, w. martin, and n. martin helped him off the dust cover to the ground. benally was kneeling on the ground and complained of chest pains and not being able to breathe. benally walked around for a brief period after the fall, then was helped to rule's pickup truck near the breaker building.at approximately 10:30 a.m., mountain coal company's emt arrived on the scene and started to provide care for benally. benally was put on a back board, given oxygen, and placed into mountain coal company's ambulance. they started towards the delta county hospital.while traveling to the hospital, no pulse was detected on benally, and the automatic emergency defibrillator (aed) was used. his pulse returned for a short time, then stopped. cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) was started but vital signs were not detected again. the delta county ambulance was met in route to delta, colorado. the delta county emts boarded the mountain coal company's ambulance and assisted with cpr until it reached the hospital. benally was pronounced dead at the hospital.investigationon thursday, june 9, 2011, msha inspector danny cerise was on the mine property conducting an e01 inspection. cerise was traveling the surface area of the underground mine, inspecting a variety of surface installations. at approximately 10:22 a.m., cerise overheard a company radio report that a contractor at the scalping tower project was involved in an accident. the radio communication did not define the extent of injury.at approximately, 11:00 a.m., cerise traveled to the accident scene. while at the location, cerise was informed that the injured miner, fred benally, could not be revived and was pronounced dead at the hospital.cerise met with management personnel from west elk and rocky mountain steel and discussed the accident. about this same time, the msha call center was notified of the accident, who in turn notified district and field office managers. cerise issued a 103(k) order and secured the accident scene.shortly after 12:00 p.m., delta field office supervisor, mark brewer arrived at the west elk mine. brewer had been at nearby elk creek mine when he was notified of the accident. brewer ensured the scene was secured and then he and cerise conducted preliminary interviews.an msha investigation team was assembled and arrived at the mine site on june 10, 2011. after a physical examination of the scene, the team arranged to conduct interviews with the witnesses to the accident and the individuals involved with the treatment and transportation of benally. the accident scene was documented with photographs, maps, and measurements. interviews were conducted with persons who were knowledgeable of the accident. a list of persons who participated in the investigation is contained in appendix a.

jims branch no. 3b mine, at 5:00 a.m., to conduct a pre-shift examination. the pre-shift examination fire boss report was called out to larry presley, mine foreman, at 5:55 am.john c. lester jr., general laborer, who had worked at this mine for a total of 109 days, arrived at work for the day shift prior to 6:00 a.m. at approimately 6:00 a.m., the day shift crew entered the mine and arrived on the 001-0 section at 6:30 a.m. according to the testimony of those miners interviewed, lester did not ride on the section man trip or any other man trip.jerry lane, the miner lester normally worked with, was assigned to operate a scoop on the section this day. lane trammed a scoop from the surface to the section at the start of the shift. mine management did not give instructions to lester that morning before he entered the mine, did not direct him to travel with a foreman or other eperienced miner, and did not assign him to the working section or other specific duty at the start of the shift. it is believed that lester, by himself, took a rubber-tired conveyance that he and lane normally rode on, into the mine and followed the crew underground at the start of the shift.the mine tracking system shows that lester followed lane underground eight seconds later and proceeded from the surface to a location near the 3 belt head. lester spent approimately 20 minutes in this area before continuing and arriving at the 001-0 section at approimately 6:42 a.m.according to interviews, lester left the section at approimately 7:30 a.m., to assist other miners repairing the broken coupler on the no. 3 belt head. at 7:52 a.m., gary norman, electrician and eric price, shuttle car operator, left the section and headed outside because price became ill. at approimately 7:53 a.m., norman and price arrived at the no. 3 belt head. price then asked lester to take him outside because he was sick and was going home. at 8:02 a.m., lester and price arrived outside on a rubber-tired conveyance. at 8:03 a.m., lester started back underground alone and returned to the no. 3 belt head, where repairs to the coupler were still being made.at approimately 9:01 a.m., lester and doug smith, shuttle car operator, left the no. 3 belt head and returned to the 001-0 section at 9:03 a.m. after arriving on the section the belt was restarted. smith resumed operating his shuttle car and left lester at the section tailpiece with ronnie massie, section foreman. massie stated in his interview that he instructed lester to stay at the section tailpiece, where someone could see him. massie then went to the no. 4 entry at approimately 9:10 a.m. lester was only on the section a short time before he left the section again at approimately 9:18 a.m. at this time, lane observed lester sitting at a location one break outby the section tailpiece, at the corner of the pillar block in the no. 6 entry roadway. the tracking system did not record lester passing another receiver station, so it is believed that he went to the no. 4 belt head.sometime around 12:00 noon, lane asked norman, and then asked massie, if they had seen lester. they had not, and norman and massie left the section at approimately 12:17 p.m., to look for lester.norman was the first to arrive at the no. 4 conveyor belt head. at first, he did not observe anything and was about to leave. norman then noticed something was caught in the chute boards below the no. 4 belt head and on top of the no. 3 conveyor belt. at that point, massie had just arrived at the no. 4 belt head and norman yelled for massie to turn the

crew, was conducted by the midnight shift on monday morning, october 11, 2010. the record indicated that the no. 1 and no. 11 entries had partial cuts remaining, nos. 2, 3, and 10 entries needed cleaning and dusting, and no hazards were reported in entries 4 through 9. the report was phoned outside to the day shift section foreman, larry helmick, by the pre-shift examiner, tommy adkins, at 5:15 a.m. the examination was conducted between 4:00 a.m. and 4:45 a.m.the crew entered the mine through the drift openings and traveled by rail-mounted runners to an area outby the section and traveled the remainder on mac 8 rubber-tired vehicles. on the section, helmick conducted an examination for imminent dangers prior to producing coal. the men went to their respective equipment while waiting for helmick to complete his examination.the left continuous mining machine was in the no. 1 entry with a partial cut (cleanup) remaining. the right continuous mining machine was in the no. 11 entry with a partial cut remaining. the left roof bolt machine was parked in the no. 2 entry and the right roof bolt machine was in no. 10 entry.the left continuous mining machine was in the no. 1 entry. the plan was for the crew to extract an additional 10 feet out of the no. 1 face. the no. 1 entry was mined on the previous friday during the evening shift when a 15-foot cut (lift) had been mined. the day shift crew encountered draw rock that had fallen in the original 15 foot lift due to the area not being supported and left standing over the weekend. once the additional 10 feet of coal was extracted from the no. 1 face, a brow was created that measured 15 feet into the cut and the height of the cut went from approximately 8 feet to 6 feet high in a distance of less than 5 feet.after completing the cut in no. 1, the left roof bolting machine, operated by allen shrewsberry and william dooley, moved to the no. 1 face and supported the roof with bolts. at the beginning of the cut, the roof bolting machine operators asked chad kennedy, scoop operator, to retrieve the longer wrenches from the other roof bolting machine. the roof bolt operators felt that the longer wrenches would make it easier to install and tighten the roof supports in higher roof conditions.when the bolting of the no. 1 entry was complete, the roof bolter remained in the no. 1 entry. shrewsberry and dooley were at the back end of the roof bolting machine waiting on the continuous mining machine operators to complete their cut cycle in the number 3 entry. after the place was bolted, kennedy came over with the wrenches they had requested and handed them to dooley. dooley gave one to shrewsberry and went around on the off side, (his control station side), and leaned over to place the wrench in the steel tray when a vertical section of rock brow fell, striking him and knocking him to the mine floor. the rock measured 30 inches high, by 66 inches long and was 4 to 7 inches thick. the accident occurred at 10:30 a.m.chad kennedy, scoop operator, saw the rock hit dooley, ran to the accident scene near the no. 1 face, and yelled for assistance. helmick was hanging site rods outby, in the no. 1 entry at the last set of survey spads, heard the yell for help and immediately went to the bolting machine. helmick, kennedy, and shrewsberry, tried to free dooley from the rock. the curved section of rock had remained intact with the top lodged on the roof bolting machine and the bottom edge on the mine floor. the victim was under the arched section of rock and his foot was caught underneath the edge of the rock, preventing a quick extrication.carlton ""doc"" martin, left mining machine operator, had finished in the no. 3 entry and walked over to no. 1 entry to see if the bolting machine was finished when he realized that an accident had occurred. helmick instructed martin to call outside and report the accident and get an ambulance en-route. martin contacted the outside man, david franco, and explained there had been an accident and that they needed an ambulance.martin then alerted the rest of the crew that help was needed in the no. 1 entry and that a rock had fallen on dooley. chris kamet, shuttle car operator and emt, went to the first-aid supply area and secured first-aid material, blankets, and a stretcher. he went to the accident site and began administering first aid with other crew members. rescuers freed dooley after chipping and removing the rock from around his foot, and using jacks and a pry bar to lift the rock. the crew placed dooley on a stretcher, administered oxygen, and transported him via rubber-tired vehicle to the end of the track. at that point, the victim was placed on the rail runner and transported to the surface. an ambulance was waiting and transported dooley to raleigh general hospital in beckley, west virginia. dooley was pronounced dead at 12:05 p.m."

they tried to unplug it, but could not clear the blockage. nunn informed noel that the underground batch plant was still operating because there was enough aggregate in the underground storage silo. noel called ken anderson, batch plant operator, and told him the aggregate silo was full so he would have enough material to operate.at approimately 8:00 p.m., noel assigned matt inama, backfill operator, to clean up the surface area of the aggregate delivery system, while john conklin, jammer operator, and noel attempted to unplug the system underground. inama observed the light flashing on the panel at the surface, indicating a plug at the 860 level. he went underground and observed the aggregate material in the 860 level rock bo. noel and conklin went underground to the 860 level and looked into the lower chute door below the rock bo and saw that it was clear of material. conklin looked at the upper chute door and saw that material was built up in the rock bo and the pipe was full. using an air lance, conklin attempted to break up the clog. conklin was able to clear out some of the material in the rock bo and was able to establish air space between the clogged material in the pipe and the dead bed below in the rock bo.joel schorr (victim) started his shift at 7:00 p.m. on august 11, 2010. schorr was working underground when he was contacted around midnight by noel to accompany him to the ventilation shaft to clear the plugged aggregate pipe. schorr contacted david johnson, hoist operator, and told johnson that he and noel needed to go into the shaft to check the plugged pipe. at 12:49 a.m., noel and schorr boarded the top of the hoist conveyance from the 1225 level. observing a remote camera, johnson saw the men board the top of the conveyance carrying a short-handle ae. both men were observed wearing full body harness fall protection. as the conveyance approached the 860 level, the speed was slowed to 50 feet per minute. they started hitting the aggregate pipe just above the rock bo and worked their way up the pipe. conklin, who was positioned on top of the rock bo, observed the material start to fall and flow as noel and schorr worked their way up the shaft. conklin described the activity of striking the pipe as tapping on it, rather than beating. conklin said they stopped 15 feet above him and then made two more short moves with the conveyance, at which point he could not see them. at approimately 1:10 a.m., conklin stated there was a sudden large surge of material coming down the pipe. he immediately shut the door on top of the rock bo, but the material overwhelmed the bo and the door blew open. conklin turned his back to the falling pipes and debris and made his way down the steps to get help. schorr and noel were fatally struck by the falling pipe and aggregate.johnson had been monitoring pressures on the hoist hydraulics. one of the men used the bell cord to signal when to start and stop the conveyance. johnson started and stopped the conveyance 4 or 5 times and had slowed the travel speed down to 26 feet per minute. the last elevation he recalled was 820 feet. he stated the hoist had been running about 820 psi when the pressure on the hoist suddenly spiked to 3,000 psi and the hoist drum was ripped from its mounts. the needle on the hoist's controller indicated the elevation of the conveyance was above the 860 level. at approimately 1:00 a.m., anderson heard a noise and could see rock fly out of the transfer bo at the 860 level on the control room video monitor. the monitor then went dead.immediately after the accident occurred, the mine operator started an etensive rescue and recovery operation. the mine safety and health administration (msha) was notified of the accident at 2:13 a.m. on august 12, 2010, by a telephone call from thomas bassier, manager safety and health, to msha's emergency call center. rodney gust, staff assistant, was notified at 2:26 a.m. an order was issued under the provisions of section 103(j) and later modified to section 103(k) of the mine act to ensure the safety of miners.personnel from msha were dispatched to the mine and arrived at 4:30 a.m. on august 12, 2010. a command center was established at the mine to coordinate efforts with the mine rescue teams. rescue teams began searching the areas in and around the ventilation shaft for any signs of the two miners. a camera was dropped down the ventilation shaft but neither miner was discovered. rescue teams broke through a bulkhead at the 1330 level and encountered a log jam of pipes, brackets, clamps, and aggregate. efforts to rescue and or recover the two miners were hampered by the amount of material that had been destroyed and the condition of the ventilation shaft. after etensive efforts to locate the miners, they were recovered on august 18, 2010.

Virginia|Coal|Consolidation Coal Company|Coal (Bituminous)|2010-07-29T11:55:00-04:00|WestVirginia|WestVirginia|on thursday, july 29, 2010, larry mayle, day shift section foreman for the 9-south mains left side section, received the pre-shift call out report from brian leonard, midnight shift foreman, for the 9-south mains left side section. no hazardous conditions were reported. after receiving the call out, mayle and the day shift crew (richard barnhart, continuous miner operator; jesse adkins (victim), integral roof bolter (left side); donald banko, integral roof bolter operator (right side); frank polce, loading machine operator; james wilkins, ram car operator; and ronald buckley, mechanic) for the 9-south mains section proceeded underground and traveled to the section.the crew arrived on the section at approximately 8:40 a.m., and walked to the power center. mayle discussed page 7, parts 10, 11, and 12 of the approved mine roof control plan (see appendix d) with the crew. after discussing this section of the roof control plan, mayle examined the working faces. the crew then proceeded to their work areas. barnhart was approached by charlie dye, integral roof bolter operator (right side), who was walking off the 18d overcast. dye informed barnhart there was a crack in the left side rib adjacent to the continuous mining machine. an unsuccessful attempt had been made to pry down the rib on the midnight shift by dye. barnhart then walked to the continuous mining machine and retracted the automated temporary roof supports (atrs) and rib protectors and moved the machine towards the left side of the entry for servicing. he then proceeded to check the bits on the cutter-head and determined there were several bits broken off in the bit holder. buckley was called to work on the bits. the bits were repaired and the water sprays were cleaned.joe morgan, foreman mentor, was also on the section when the accident occurred. morgan had walked from the 17d section to the 9-south section and examined the faces on the right side of the section. he noticed the section had not yet begun to mine on the left side and traveled to the belt overcast where the continuous mining machine was located. he walked to the front of the continuous mining machine with barnhart to examine the roof and ribs. the roof and ribs were determined to be safe by both individuals. the continuous mining machine was located approximately 20 feet from the face during their examination. during this time banko and adkins were in the process of hauling supplies to the continuous mining machine. mayle began another examination of the no. 2 to no. 4 entries at approximately 10:48 a.m. during the investigation of the accident, the date board indicated the no. 4 face, which was located at the bottom of the belt overcast, was examined at 11:01 a.m. soon after making examinations, mayle walked onto the 18d belt overcast and asked banko why the crew was not mining. barnhart informed him of the broken bits that needed to be replaced. mayle then left the 18d belt overcast and went to the right side section where he talked to larry broadwater, right side section foreman, concerning the mining of the no. 5 entry and ventilation.test bolts were installed at approximately 11:15 a.m., and the continuous mining machine was trammed to the face. the atrs jacks were set and the face was undercut. the atrs jacks were then retracted and the continuous mining machine was backed up to mine the top half of the face. the atrs jacks were set again and barnhart began cutting the immediate roof. barnhart was about to flag banko and adkins to retract the atrs jacks when he noticed a flash from the victim's cap light. barnhart actuated the panic bar, which removed power from the continuous mining machine. barnhart and banko went around the boom of the continuous mining machine and found the victim pinned against the left side. he was located outby the rib protector near the rear bumper. the rock that struck the victim measured 193 inches in length, by 55 inches high, and up to 16 inches thick.the general practice of the integral roof bolter operators at the loveridge #22 mine was to stand towards the rear of the machine, outside the protection of the rib protector (see photo of rib protector in appendix e) while the continuous miner was cutting the roof for an overcast. they chose to stand at this location so they would not be struck by flying rock and debris.morgan was adjusting the laser sight located behind the loading machine when he heard barnhart yell out for help (the laser sight had been struck by a piece of mobile equipment during the previous shift or when the scoop was supplying the continuous mining machine). morgan proceeded to the accident site to assist. due to the size and weight of the rock, they were unable to lift the rock off the victim. morgan then went to the right side section to get help. morgan instructed members of the crew to get jacks, cribs, and first aid equipment and take the materials to the accident site. morgan then went to the mine phone located at the section power center to communicate with the dispatcher.mayle arrived at the accident scene and assisted with the removal of the victim. the victim was removed from between the rock and frame of the machine using jacks and cribs. emergency medical technicians (emts) melvin delaney and dana burdette arrived at the accident scene. delaney was on the east mains haulage and burdette was on the 17d section prior to the accident. both men were only a few minutes away from the 18d section. the crew was already in the process of strapping the victim to a back board when they arrived. the victim was evaluated by both delaney and burdette with no vital signs detected. the victim was then placed into a ram car and cardio pulmonary resuscitation (cpr) was administered while he was transported to the end of the section supply track. the victim was moved from the ram car to a rail mounted mantrip and transported to the surface. cpr was continued during transportation. once on the surface, the victim was transferred by the emt's to the marion county emergency medical services (ems). the victim was pronounced dead at 1:18 p.m., by matt smith, marion county medical examiner.

two shuttle cars were transporting coal from the continuous mining machine to the feeder and were switching out in the second crosscut outby in the no. 2 entry.  the no. 1 (left) shuttle car, operated by justin tinney, traveled up the no. 2 entry to the switch out location, while the no. 2 (center) shuttle car, operated by zachary simmons, crossed over from the no. 3 entry to this location. justin tinney was normally the right side continuous miner operator, but was filling in on the no. 1 shuttle car.  tinney had operated this shuttle car from time to time.the left side roof bolting machine was located in the connecting crosscut between the nos. 1 and 2 entries, two crosscuts outby the no. 2 face, with the front end of the machine near the no. 2 entry.  jacob hinkle and jeremiah armstead, left side roof bolter operators, were performing required parameter checks on their roof bolting machine while they waited for the continuous mining machine to finish the cut in the no. 2 face.teddy alderman, mine foreman, arrived on the section at approximately 7:35 a.m., and went to the right side of the section to evaluate the work of the right side bolting crew installing supplemental supports in the intake.  at approximately 8:30 a.m., near the time of the accident, he and mcmillion were taking measurements in the no. 4 entry.at approximately 8:30 a.m., starcher crossed the intersection in the no. 2 entry where the shuttle cars were switching, walking from the no. 3 entry, and stopped at the roof bolting machine.  starcher exchanged greetings with hinkle, who was checking the vacuum pressure of the roof bolter heads.  armstead was cleaning out the rear operator’s deck and did not notice that starcher had walked into the crosscut.  starcher stood near the opening of the crosscut when the no. 1 shuttle car arrived at the intersection and stopped to wait while the no. 2 shuttle car was loaded at the continuous miner.  tinney got out of his operator’s compartment to converse briefly with hinkle.  tinney saw starcher standing near the roof bolting machine, close to the inby corner of the intersection and got back into the shuttle car.simmons, operating the no. 2 shuttle car, located behind the continuous miner, noticed starcher cross the intersection towards the roof bolter just before simmons trammed outby towards the section coal feeder.  starcher was standing close to the intersection. as simmons approached the intersection, he kept an eye on starcher, to ensure that the inby end of his shuttle car did not hit him when the shuttle car turned and cleared the intersection.  at this point, hinkle saw starcher enter the no. 2 entry and began walking towards the continuous miner.after the no. 2 shuttle car passed the second outby intersection, tinney trammed the no. 1 shuttle car toward the continuous miner.  at this point, the mining cut was almost completed and the end of the continuous mining machine conveyor boom was located near midpoint of the last open crosscut intersection.  the no. 1 shuttle car traveled a distance of approximately 75 feet.  a set of ventilation fly pads (curtains) were installed between the two intersections, which the no. 1 shuttle car passed through.  tinney rang his sounding device as he passed though the fly pads.  (see appendix c)lilly was standing slightly into the connecting crosscut between the nos. 2 and 3 entries,  facing inby towards the face.  upon arrival of the no. 1 shuttle car, the remainder of coal from the cut was loaded into it.  as the no. 1 shuttle car left the continuous mining machine, lilly turned to see a mine light shining from beneath the retreating shuttle car and he saw the car dragging someone.  lilly yelled for the car to stop, causing tinney to stop the car about 29 feet outby the continuous mining machine.  starcher was found with about a third of his body visible from underneath the shuttle car.  his left foot was caught in an opening in the underside of the shuttle car between a conveyor flight and the metal framing.lilly yelled for tinney to run to the mine phone and notify the surface that a serious injury had just occurred, that “he’d just run over somebody.”  hinkle heard the commotion and ran towards the continuous mining machine and shuttle car.  he checked starcher for life signs and found none.  cpr was attempted, but with the victim lying face down in the mud it was necessary to first extricate him from the shuttle car.  the entire section crew assisted in recovering starcher.  alderman and mcmillion were notified of the accident and went to the scene. it was necessary to raise the shuttle car and create space to reach starcher’s foot, which was caught by the car.  tinney, after learning of the need to raise the shuttle car, retrieved a jack from the mantrip.  rescuers were unable to raise the shuttle car with this jack and it was decided to place a timber under the shuttle car’s right front hydraulic service jack.  the hydraulic service jack was able to raise the shuttle car enough to access starcher’s foot.  the shuttle car conveyor chain was reversed and starcher’s foot was freed with the help of doug bragg, who was able to cut the boot loose.  according to the miners’ testimonies, it took 15 to 20 minutes to free the victim.starcher was removed and placed on a back board.  his mouth was cleaned and further resuscitation measures were attempted.  at no time did starcher exhibit life signs.  hinkle and mcmillion, emt’s, along with others at the scene, attempted to revive the victim throughout the recovery efforts. starcher was carried on the backboard approximately 300 feet to the mantrip and transported to the surface.  the victim was transported by the quinwood ambulance service to greenbrier valley hospital in lewisburg, west virginia, where he was pronounced dead."

time. at 7:10 a.m., he conducted a safety meeting with the maintenance and quarry crews and discussed a variety of topics. at 7:30 a.m., farris distributed several work orders then went into the maintenance office. sometime during the morning, richard calhoun, operations manager, told joseph ziemba, maintenance man, that the roller mill was making an unusual noise. at 11:30 a.m., ziemba went to the second level of the fines building and asked richard livers, mill operator, to shut down the roller mill so he could check the rollers to determine if they needed oil. livers shut down the roller then followed ziemba to the first floor and observed him place a lock on the breaker box that controlled the rollers in the lower part of the mill. neither of them attempted to lock out the second floor power switch for the whizzer blades located in the upper part of the mill. the power to the mill rollers was not actually turned off when ziemba moved the breaker box handle to the ""off"" position because the linkage inside the breaker box door was missing. when ziemba pulled the handle to the ""off"" position, the circuit breaker was actually still in the ""on"" position. the breaker box defect was not visible with the breaker box door closed. at 1:45 p.m., farris and johnny drain, maintenance man, arrived at the roller mill to help troubleshoot it. ziemba had opened an observation door and an access door. he identified that some bolts inside the mill needed to be tightened. farris had livers remove ziemba's lock from the breaker box and start the roller mill to hear the noise. about 3:00 p.m., calhoun arrived at the roller mill while drain, farris, and ziemba were filling the lower oil reservoirs through the open observation door. he wanted to hear the noise so livers started the roller mill again. after livers stopped the roller mill, farris told him to lock it out and started through the open access door. at that time, drain was standing on the walkway overlooking the roller mill observation door, calhoun was standing nearby, and ziemba was heading toward his truck parked outside the fines building to get wrenches to tighten the loose bolts inside the roller mill. livers walked down to the first floor, where the breaker box was located, and moved the outside handle to the ""off"" position. however, when he attempted to place ziemba's lock, livers was unable to get the handle aligned properly to accept the lock so he did not place it on the handle. livers went back to the second floor, saw that farris was inside the mill, and yelled down to ziemba that he needed help locking out the breaker box. before ziemba came back into the fines building, livers went downstairs and made another attempt to lock the breaker box. he was again unsuccessful and started back to the second floor. livers met ziemba at the top of the stairs inside the fines building, spoke to him briefly, and walked toward the roller mill controls. about 3:50 p.m., the roller mill started. at that time, ziemba had descended the stairs, drain was still standing near the roller mill, and calhoun was standing nearby. drain ran toward the mill controls and saw that livers had already turned it off. after running back to the front of the mill, drain called the scale house and katrenia thirsty, scale operator, called for emergency medical services (ems), who arrived at the mine at 4:17 p.m. at 4:25 p.m., ems looked into the roller mill and noted that farris was deceased. the cause of death was attributed to blunt force trauma. investigation of the accident on the day of the accident, the mine safety and health administration (msha) was notified at 4:01 p.m. by a telephone call from dennis johnson, safety director, to msha's emergency hotline. fred gatewood, assistant district manager, was notified and an investigation was started the same day. in order to ensure the safety of all persons, an order was issued pursuant to section 103(j) of the mine act. this order was later modified to section 103(k) of the mine act when the first authorized representative arrived at the mine. a 104(a) citation was issued because management would not provide information regarding the accident. msha's accident investigation team traveled to the mine, made a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident. msha conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, employees, baldor electric company, and kelly power services. a 104(a) citation was issued to u. s. lime because management hindered the investigation.

james erwin and jason thomas, continuous mining machine operators, kenneth daily and christopher miller, roof bolting machine operators, gregory williams and dave runyon, shuttle car operators, thomas gooslin, electrician, and chris fluty, trainee, started their shift. the crew entered the mine at the scarlet portal and traveled to the no. 1 section via a rail-mounted personnel carrier. the crew arrived on the section at 7:15 a.m., and began preventative maintenance servicing of the equipment and preparing for production. upon completion of preparation work, they began the mining process. normal mining was conducted with three cuts of coal mined in the first four hours of the shift. this section is referred to as a ""walking section."" the left side continuous mining machine was mining the no. 2 left crosscut and the no. 4 entry. after the left side mining was completed, the right side continuous mining machine mined the no. 6 right crosscut. at 11:00 a.m., the right side continuous mining machine, operated by erwin, started mining the no. 7 entry. runyon and williams operated the shuttle cars, which were changing out one crosscut inby the loading point in the no. 5 entry. this allowed the shuttle cars to travel to the continuous mining machine at the second line of crosscuts outby the face. shortly after completing mining in the no. 7 entry, while erwin was starting to move the continuous mining machine to the next cut, the section experienced a power outage at approximately 11:57 a.m. during the power outage, the crew worked on the construction of a permanent stopping in the crosscut between the no. 5 and 6 entries, one crosscut outby the last open crosscut. this stopping was to be used later to separate the primary intake escapeway from the conveyor belt entries. the power was restored to the section at approximately 12:20 p.m. while the power was off, draw rock fell in the unsupported portion of the no. 7 entry. this prevented the roof bolting machine from entering the area to install roof support. erwin informed williams that the area of the fall would have to be cleaned. with the stopping installed in the crosscut between the no. 5 and no. 6 entries, the haul road previously used at the 2nd open crosscut was blocked. this required the shuttle cars to use the last open crosscut and travel through ventilation fly pads installed at the mouth of the no. 7 entry. when williams went through the fly pads into the no. 7 entry, erwin positioned himself in the intersection. once the shuttle car was in the entry and under the continuous mining machine, erwin went into the entry, stood along the right rib and loaded the car using his mining machine remote control unit. as the shuttle car left the entry, erwin stayed in the entry near the continuous mining machine. a second shuttle car load was needed to clean the area and williams returned with his shuttle car. erwin again positioned himself in the intersection as the shuttle car traveled into the entry. when the shuttle car was under conveyor boom of the continuous mining machine, erwin went back into the entry to load the car. after the shuttle car was loaded, erwin signaled williams, ""that was all,"" and positioned himself along the right rib. williams thought erwin was in a safe location and started tramming his shuttle car out of the area. see appendix c. while william's shuttle car was being loaded, miller came to the no. 7 entry to see if the place was ready for the roof bolting machine. as the shuttle car was leaving the area, miller saw erwin take what was described as a step and a half at a 45 degree angle, toward the continuous mining machine. the shuttle car either caught or pushed erwin into the rib. miller immediately yelled for the shuttle car to be stopped. when it was stopped, miller went to the shuttle car and discovered erwin pinned against the rib. the shuttle car was moved forward, towards the continuous mining machine, to free him. after erwin was freed, other members of the crew learned of the accident. first aid supplies and a battery powered personnel carrier were taken to the accident scene. first aid was administered by the crew and erwin was transported to the end of the track on the section. he was loaded on a rail-mounted personnel carrier and transported to the mouth of the section by chapman, dailey, and runyon. at the mouth of the section, erwin was transported to the surface and cared for by eugene vance, mine foreman and tim dingess, maintenance foreman. on the surface, erwin was transported by s.t.a.t. ambulance service to belo, west virginia, and then air lifted by health net to st. marys hospital, located in huntington, west virginia. on friday, may 21, 2010, erwin died while hospitalized from injuries caused by the accident.

	on thursday, april 22, 2010, john king (victim) started the second shift at approximately 3:30 p.m. the coal crews, mmu 001 and 004, traveled to the mine floor by elevator and then to the no. 2 section on rubber tired mantrips. upon arrival on the section at approximately 4:00 p.m., kevin torres, foreman, and bruce brown, assistant section foreman, conducted on-shift examinations of the working faces. after completing the examinations, torres had several conversations with different individual crews, including the bolt crew, hauler crew, and the continuous miner crew. 
	brown came upon torres talking to the bolt crew and he spoke with john king, discussing the mining cut cycle for the day. brown instructed king to mine in the no. 5 left entry and to ramp up to cut extra height for a future belt drive. this process took two hours and ten minutes to complete before moving to the next coal face. 
	king continued to mine coal from in the nos. 6 left, 8 right, 5 left and 6 left faces. after he finished mining in the no. 6 left crosscut, king received instructions from brown to move the off standard, continuous miner, to the no. 8 left crosscut. brown was positioned in the no. 5 left crosscut, where extra continuous miner cable was present, to watch and signal when the remaining machine cable slack was used. lewis eads, hauler operator, had walked to the no. 7 entry and was rolling up check fly pads, preparing for the haulers to travel to and from the continuous miner. alan christian, hauler operator, was positioned between brown and king, watching for brown to signal with his cap light when the continuous miner was out of cable slack. christian was also watching the cable behind the continuous miner with king. 
	with christian watching, king used the remote control unit to move the continuous miner toward no. 8 crosscut and looked back at brown for a signal when christian noticed the slack had stopped moving and heard king yelling for help. christian immediately looked back at king and saw that the conveyor boom of the continuous miner had him pinned against the coal rib. king told christian to get if off of him. at the same time, eads had heard king yelling for help and ran to the continuous miner. eads saw christian trying to move king away from the boom when he noticed that the rope used for pulling slack cable and continuous miner cable had become entangled with king against the coal rib. christian cut the rope, allowing king freedom of movement. eads placed the remote control unit on the continuous miner boom and both men took king by his arms and laid him on his right side against the coal rib. 
	christian instructed eads to stay with king while he went to get help. brown was notified by christian that king had been injured by the continuous miner boom. christian immediately went to the phone and notified the mine dispatcher that a man was hurt and they needed transportation. christian went to the power center, obtained the first aid kit and returned to king's location. 
	brown went for more help immediately after being notified of the accident. kevin torres, section foreman, and ron king, section electrician/emt, were at the feeder when emery perdue, equipment operator, who had heard about the accident, notified them of the accident, at approximately 11:11 p.m. both men ran to the location where the victim was lying. brown, christian, and eads were attending to john king's needs when both men arrived. torres instructed several men, corey wills and danny brown, roof bolter operators, to retrieve the first aid kits, a mantrip, and to go to a phone and call the dispatcher. 
	ron king, torres, and wills, placed john king onto a backboard, administered oxygen, applied a c-collar, and loaded him onto a mantrip. the victim was accompanied to the surface by torres, ron king, and wills attending to him while david lafferty and doug hampton operated the mantrip. jan care ambulance service arrived at 11:23 p.m., and waited for john king to be brought out of the mine. john king arrived on the surface at approximately 11:40 p.m. the ambulance left the mine site and arrived at raleigh general hospital at 11:59 p.m., april 22, 2010. he was then flown to charleston area medical center (camc) by health net. king received several surgeries before he died at 11:40 a.m., on april 23, 2010.

equipment cleaning inc. three employees picked up a c6500 chevrolet flat bed truck with three rear-mounted pressure washers, while two employees of the same company picked up a dodge 1 ton flatbed truck with 2 rear-mounted pressure washers and traveled to the thunder ridge surface mine. the pressure-wash trucks were followed by shepherd in his personal pick-up truck. the group arrived at the mine at approximately 7:00 a.m. larry david hamilton, justin conley, and larry anthony marsillett were assigned to the c6500 chevrolet flatbed truck. ryan scott bailey and aaron dewayne collett were assigned to the dodge 1 ton flatbed truck. the employees proceeded to the water hole and installed a water pump for filling the water supply tanks on the trucks. after the water tanks were filled, both crews returned to the bonnett rock pit area to begin cleaning mobile equipment. the three employees in the chevrolet flatbed truck stopped at the mobile equipment lined up in the bonnett rock pit area. the two employees in the dodge flatbed truck traveled to the location of two highwall drills, located approximately ï¿½ of a mile further around the pit travel way. the pressure washer unit mounted directly behind the driver's side of the chevrolet flatbed truck is labeled unit no. 1. the pressure washer unit located directly behind the passengers' side of the cab is unit no. 2, and the rearmost pressure washer unit is labeled unit no. 3. some time between 8:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m., marsillett, began cleaning a caterpillar dozer with pressure washing unit no. 3. unit no. 2 was inoperative due to a mechanical problem that occurred on the previous shift. shepherd came to the mine site to work on unit 2. hamilton and conley started unit no. 1 and went to the caterpillar 993k wheel loader. once started, conley returned to assist marsillett with unit no. 3. soon after unit no. 1 was started and put into operation, hamilton experienced trouble with the water temperature heat and the water in the pressure washer unit began freezing. at approximately 9:00 a.m., shepherd positioned himself between pressure washer unit no. 1 and no. 2 to attempt repairs for the heating system on the no. 1 unit. according to the employees interviewed, shepherd worked on the pressure washer for approximately two hours. during this period, shepherd was sitting on a plastic, five gallon bucket with the engine of unit no. 1 running and the exhaust discharge blowing in his direction. sometime between 10:50 and 11:00 a.m., bailey and collet, returned to the location of the other employees while en route to refill their water tank. bailey stopped and informed shepherd that the heating element on one of their pressure washer units had become inoperative. shepherd was positioned between the no. 1 and no. 2 pressure washer units at this time. shepherd acknowledged the problem with the pressure washer unit on the dodge truck and bailey continued toward the water hole. it took approximately 30 minutes for bailey and collett to refill the truck's water tank. after refilling the water tank, bailey and collett drove back through the area where shepherd had been performing repairs. during interviews, bailey stated that it appeared shepherd was continuing repairs at the time, but was unsure of shepherd's true condition when he and collett passed back through the area. at approximately 11:15 a.m., hamilton asked shepherd for a nozzle for his pressure washer. shepherd got up and retrieved a nozzle for hamilton and returned to his repair work. at approximately 11:30 a.m., conley returned to the truck, where he observed shepherd slumped over the exhaust muffler of unit no. 1. according to conley, shepherd was unresponsive. conley immediately contacted hamilton and marsillett for help. before reaching the location of the highwall drills, bailey and collett received a call over the c.b. radio from conley, who stated that something was wrong with shepherd and he needed help. upon arrival, marsillett and the other employees removed shepherd from the flatbed truck and placed him on the ground where collett attempted cpr. shepherd was not responsive. conley left the accident scene to get help, while marsillett called 911. the mine medical emergency technician (met), chris gross, checked shepherd and found no vital signs. the wooten, ky fire & rescue personnel arrived at the scene, followed by trans-star ambulance service. shepherd was pronounced dead at 12:50 p.m. by leslie county deputy corner jimmy d. couch.

blake's ridge portal at 8:00 a.m. they were assigned to rock dust in the 4-a section. after getting the rock dust machine and locomotives ready, they were delayed at the blake's ridge portal bottom due to work on the trolley wire. while waiting, andrew simpson, assistant shift foreman, called them on the mine phone and ordered them to talk with mike conjeski, mine foreman, about going to the fish creek portal to get a piece of belt for the 5-north no. 2 beltline. after discussing the situation with conjeski, they determined there were not any operable locomotives at the blake's ridge portal that could be used to retrieve the belt. conjeski decided to have william coulson, general inside laborer, and darnell fulks, bring the no. 47 and no. 92 locomotives to the blake's ridge portal from the fish creek portal. at approximately 10:00 a.m., goudy and louden went to the 4-north area to see if there were any empty dollies (lowboys) that could be used to transport the belt. they found three empty dollies and the no. 48 locomotive. they coupled the no. 48 locomotive to the dollies and waited on coulson and fulks, so they could have a trail locomotive. after coulson and fulks arrived, they arranged and attached the locomotives and dollies in the order they wanted, then started towards fish creek portal at approximately 11:30 a.m. louden operated the no. 48 lead locomotive with goudy riding with him. coulson operated the no. 47 trail locomotive behind the trip while fulks followed in the no. 92 locomotive. coulson was following approximately 1,500 to 2,000 ft. behind the no. 48 locomotive and dollies. louden called donald beyser, dispatcher, to tell him they had cleared the mainline switch on the fish creek portal bottom. the trip proceeded to the fish creek portal track switch. goudy told louden to stop just outby the fish creek portal track switch where he would uncouple the dollies from the locomotive, attach the trail (no. 47) locomotive to the empty dollies, and push the dollies to the slope bottom. goudy put a skid under one of the outby wheels of the dollies between himself and the no. 48 locomotive to prevent the dollies from drifting towards him. when goudy uncoupled the drawbar from the locomotive and the dollies drifted away (inby) from him approximately 5 to 10 feet and stopped in a dip in the track. goudy saw the lights of the no. 47 locomotive. to stop the locomotive, he stood to the side and signaled (flagged off) coulson to stop the locomotive with his cap light, until the lights of the no. 47 locomotive were shut off. goudy knelt down over the drawbar to unhook the safety pin. louden had just gotten out of the no. 48 locomotive, when the no. 47 locomotive hit the inby end of the dollies and pinned goudy between the outby end of the dollies and the frame of the no. 48 locomotive. the coupler of the no. 47 locomotive rode over the bumper of the inby dolly, locking the dollies to the locomotive. after observing the accident, coulson moved the no. 47 locomotive and empty dollies back to free goudy. coulson used the no. 47 locomotive radio to request help. louden used the no. 48 locomotive radio and called for alfred ""chip"" ratcliffe, shift foreman and emergency medical technician (emt) at the fish creek portal, to notify him of the accident and request that he come to the fish creek portal bottom. louden went to the mine phone to call the dispatcher for an ambulance. ratcliffe caught a ride on the no. 92 locomotive and was already headed toward the fish creek portal when he heard someone call for help. ratcliffe arrived at the scene and observed goudy lying face down in the middle of the track, approximately 10 feet inby the no. 48 locomotive. ratcliffe checked for a pulse and respiration, but was not able to detect either. he went to the phone to notify mark courtney, assistant superintendent, of the accident. ratcliffe sent coulson and fulks to the portal bottom to get a mantrip and a stretcher for goudy. there were no mantrips on the bottom and they could not find the stretcher. after hearing someone call for help on the mine radio, chris sterling, belt foreman and emt, and robert gallentine, master mechanic, also went to the accident scene. sterling checked goudy and found a faint pulse with short, faint respirations. sterling sent miners to get a trauma kit. gallentine went to get a four wheel cart. goudy was moved to the cart, transported to the elevator, and transported to the surface. sterling again checked goudy for pulse and respiration at the elevator but did not detect either. sterling was in the process of administering oxygen to goudy when the tri-state ambulance service arrived. goudy was transferred to the ambulance service where a paramedic, in consultation with dr. phillips at the medical communication center, pronounced him dead at 12:46 p.m.

(see appendix c) as the sled was being pushed into the spur, the inby corner or the sled caught on the overhead high voltage cable that was sagging from the mine roof. the trip was stopped and cain told osborne that he was going to the other side of the track to hold the cable up and prevent the sled from hanging on the high voltage cable. using his cap lamp, cain flagged osborne to start into the spur. osborne continued into the spur track, watching for cain to flag him to stop. cain did not signal, so osborne continued to a point that he thought the supply car would clear the main track. osborne left the locomotive and walked toward the inby end of the trip, looking for cain. osborne did not see or hear cain as he rounded the turn from the main track line into the spur. he shouted and whistled for cain with no response, and proceeded toward the end of the trip trying to locate cain. osborne then turned around and walked outby toward the surface and noticed cain's light lying on the mine floor. osborne yelled and went to cain but did not get a response. this was around 11:00 pm. osborne checked for a pulse and started to administer cpr. osborne decided that he needed help and starting running toward the area where ball was located. as osborne came upon 13 headgate switch, he met ball walking toward him. osborne told ball that cain was hurt and to go get help while he called on the mine phone for assistance. ball went to where cain was lying and checked for a pulse and checked his pupils. ball started cpr while waiting for help to arrive. osborne returned to the accident site and helped ball perform cpr. at this time, delano kirby, emt, along with roger white, bobby thomas, anthony rawlings, and cory tucker, arrived and helped with the care of cain until the first aid boxes arrived. cain was placed on a back board and transported to the surface by kirby, along with white, thomas, rawlings, and tucker. they arrived on the surface around 11:38 pm. no vital signs were detected on mr. cain. cain was brought to the surface where the boone county ambulance authority service was waiting. ems personnel administered care to cain with no response. a doctor from the office of the west virginia state medical examiner arrived and pronounced cain dead. the victim was transported to the west virginia state medical examiner's office.

(victim) reported for work at 6:30 a.m., his normal starting time. larry e. stine, superintendent, presented a tool box talk for all employees and then assigned tasks to everyone. afterward, trimmer performed his assigned maintenance duties. about 8:05 a.m., gerald a. evans, secondary plant operator, noticed the feeder in the surge tunnel contained too many fines. this situation was referred to as ""free flowing."" evans called stine on the radio to report the problem and then went into the surge tunnel to check the feeder. stine went to the plant and noticed stone was still coming out of the surge tunnel on the belt conveyor (no. 1 belt). evans told stine that nothing was broken on the feeder and he was returning to the control room to check on the other belt conveyors. stine entered the surge tunnel to determine how to correct the problem with the feeder. shortly after, evans noticed the no. 1 belt shut off and the console lights indicated another belt conveyor (no. 136 belt) was not operating. stine called scott m. stahle, maintenance superintendent, on his cell phone to discuss the problem with the free flowing feeder. stine came out of the surge tunnel and gave trimmer his phone to talk to stahle. stahle then told trimmer how to repair the feeder. stahle said a restrictor plate (used to regulate flow of material) should be placed in front of the feeder. evans went to the entrance of the surge tunnel and told stine the belt conveyor going to the mill had stalled and he would check the counterweight for the no. 136 belt. stine left trimmer to address these additional problems. trimmer and joseph a. newsome, haul truck driver, entered the surge tunnel. trimmer decided to install the restrictor plate at a different location in the feeder chute than was originally planned. trimmer crawled onto the belt conveyor, leaned into the chute from the front, and took a measurement. trimmer then left the tunnel to cut a metal plate to complete the repairs. after receiving instructions from stine, newsome left trimmer to drive his truck under the secondary 2a bin to empty it. evans started the belt conveyors including the no. 1 belt and the feeder. the gauges in the secondary control room indicated that the no. 1 belt was empty. the rheostat for the feeder was turned to 100 percent and the feeder was turned on and off five or six times. at that point, evans thought that the feeder was empty or ""day lighted"" because he heard a hollow sound. the no. 1 belt and feeder were then shut down. trimmer obtained the materials needed to install the restrictor plate and returned to the office to retrieve his glasses. stine drove trimmer back to the surge tunnel and instructed him not to enter the feeder unless the pile was moved back away from the no. 1 belt feeder hopper inlet (""ringed""). evans, newsome, and trimmer, locked out and tagged the power for the no. 1 belt and took the restrictor plate and additional pieces of angle iron into the surge tunnel to modify the feeder. trimmer told them he was going to install a restrictor plate in the chute and cut it to adjust the flow as needed. trimmer welded two pieces of steel angle horizontally to the side walls of the chute from the belt side of the hopper gate. he then placed the 16-inch by 31-inch by ï¿½-inch steel plate, which he had previously cut, on the steel angles and attempted to force it in place. however, he could not move the plate to a vertical position. trimmer then crawled into the feeder hopper under the steel plate. apparently, he wanted to see what was preventing the plate from rotating to the vertical position. although the feeder hopper had been ""day lighted"", a cone of steeply angled material from the primary surge pile remained around the opening. trimmer determined that another piece of angle needed to be cut and installed. evans handed trimmer a tape measure and asked if the front of the feeder needed to be raised to adjust the flow rather than installing the plate. about 10:20 a.m., trimmer continued to take measurements inside the hopper when a small amount of stone fell causing evans to jump back. shortly after that, a large amount of stone fell engulfing trimmer. evans and newsome attempted to free trimmer but material kept falling around them. the stone was too large to shovel so they dug with their hands. evans ran outside and shouted for help. george e. jumper, water truck driver, responded and radioed for stine. stine and robert l. olsen, fine grind plant supervisor, entered the tunnel to help dig. stine ran out of the tunnel to call on his cell phone for emergency assistance. jumper, don e. halblieb and william shaffer, loader operators, entered the tunnel to assist in the digging. due to the size of the stones surrounding trimmer, all digging by rescuers was performed by hand. about 10:30 a.m., emergency medical services and numerous fire department personnel arrived at the mine and took over the rescue operations. for about one hour, they unsuccessfully tried to remove trimmer from the chute but their efforts were sporadically interrupted by additional falling material. at 11:35 a.m., an emergency medical technician pronounced trimmer dead and the rescue workers left the surge tunnel. on the surface, a front-end loader and an excavator were used to remove the primary surge pile in order to gain access to the feeder from above. once the material was moved away from the feeder, recovery workers re-entered the surge tunnel. considerable time and care were taken to ensure the safety of the recovery team throughout the entire rescue and recovery operations. trimmer was recovered from the chute at 7:11 p.m. the cause of death was attributed to asphyxiation.

crew, arrived at the mine parking area at approximately 4:15 p.m. to prepare for his shift that started at approximately 4:30 p.m. two or three times per week, graham was asked to come in early to operate the road grader, water truck, or other equipment in preparation for the normal shift. the normal second shift production shift began at 6:00 p.m. and concluded at 4:30 a.m. graham began the early shift work in the parking area operating the grader and working on the roadways at various mine locations. at approximately 5:30 p.m., larry baker, the second shift lead foreman contacted graham. he instructed graham to begin the normal production shift at 6:00 p.m. by operating the caterpillar d11n bulldozer, co. no. 1073, in a shot area directly below the no. 10 leader coal seam on the southwest side of the mac & nellie cut through area of the mine. the foreman stated that two other bulldozers would soon arrive from the buck branch area of the mine to assist graham with the same task. the foreman confirmed the correct location of the shot and direction of pushing the shot materials with graham at the start of the shift. the caterpillar d11n bulldozer, co. no. 1073, had been operated approximately 3 to 4 hours by tommy ritchie, the day shift bulldozer operator at this location, preparing the roadway and shot area for night shift production. graham trammed the bulldozer to the southwest side of the mac & nellie cut through. according to blasting shot records, the shot was fired at 11:25 a.m. on september 18, and contained approximately 55,224 cubic yards of material. graham began pushing materials into the open hazard no. 7 pit located below the shot. a bulldozer pathway approximately 200 feet in length was created adjacent to the exposed highwall by graham. two other caterpillar d11 bulldozer operators, eugene north and gary hoskins were also directed to work in the area where graham was working. when north and hoskins arrived at the site, they found graham working adjacent to the highwall. they did not communicate to graham by c.b. radio. north began operating his bulldozer on the outermost pathway, and hoskins began operating his bulldozer on the middle bulldozer pathway, adjacent to the pathway graham was working. because of the work being done by graham and hoskins, an area of undisturbed material (wind-row) approximately 11 feet in height was formed between graham's pathway and the two other bulldozers. the wind-row of material prevented north and hoskins from seeing graham's bulldozer. at approximately 11:30 p.m., russell meece, another second shift foreman, contacted graham by c.b. radio requesting the machine service hours. graham provided the hours on the service meter of the caterpillar d11n bulldozer. at approximately 12:30 a.m., paul couch, lube truck operator, arrived at the mac & nellie cut through along the main travelway located on the hazard no. 7 rider coal seam elevation adjacent to the open hazard no. 7 pit into which the three bulldozers were pushing the shot material. couch called to the three bulldozers operators on the c.b. radio and instructed them to tram to the lower elevation along the roadway for fueling of the bulldozers. north responded, then he and hoskins left the area where they had been working. as they left the area, they did not see the illumination lights on graham's bulldozer. hoskins made one pass down the top of the wind-row between the bulldozer pathways to check for graham's bulldozer. both bulldozers continued off the bench to the lower level to refuel and to eat lunch. according to their statements, both hoskins and north assumed graham had moved to another area of the mine to perform other work. meece arrived at the refueling site and asked hoskins and north about graham. after this discussion meece concluded that graham had not moved to another location. meece went to the bench elevation where the bulldozers had been working. at approximately 1:15 a.m., meece traveled to the top of the exposed highwall and used a light to look over the highwall. he observed what appeared to be a bulldozer blade below the highwall. meece notified lead foreman larry baker and the night shift area manager, taylor hignite, of the accident. meece then instructed hoskins and north to construct a roadway into the hazard no. 7 open pit to search for graham's bulldozer. at approximately 1:30 a.m., graham's body and the bulldozer he was operating were located on the hazard no. 7 pit floor, below the area of the highwall where graham had been pushing material over. the bulldozer was resting on the right side with the push arms and blade detached. mine emergency technicians (met) david bush and larry baker checked graham and found no vital signs. the victim was pronounced dead at 2:32 a.m. september 19, 2008, by perry county deputy corner, clayton brown.

Virginia|Coal|CONSOL Energy Inc|Coal (Bituminous)|2008-07-18T13:05:00-04:00|Virginia|Virginia|"on friday, july 25, 2008 at approximately 8:00 a.m., the day shift crew, under the direction of curtis gibson, section foreman, entered the mine via the contrary shaft elevator. they made a vertical descent of approximately 1,800 feet to the shaft bottom where they boarded track mounted diesel mantrips and rode approximately 4 miles to the 12 right panel off 3 east mains. the crews arrived on the 003/004 mmu at approximately 8:45 a.m. and waited in the dinner area, two crosscuts outby the no. 2 entry face, while gibson made an examination of the face areas. gibson then held a brief safety meeting with the crew before they went to their assigned work locations. after leaving the dinner hole at the start of the shift, billy brown, faceman (utility man), went to the right side continuous mining machine to finish the first cut out of 3 right crosscut. the cut had been started by the owl (midnight) shift production crew. after finishing the cut, brown backed the mining machine into the no. 3 entry and parked it just outby the last open crosscut. the right side roof bolting machine crew, todd meadows and his brother rocky meadows, were waiting in the last open crosscut adjacent to the no. 3 entry with the fletcher dual head roof bolting machine. after the continuous mining machine was backed outby the crosscut, the roof bolting machine was taken through the no. 3 entry to the 3 right crosscut and the meadows brothers bolted the fresh cut. the roof bolting machine was backed out of 3 right crosscut and placed back in the last open crosscut. the freshly bolted place was scooped and rock dusted and brown set the mining machine up in 3 right in preparation of taking a second cut. the shuttle cars and haulers were being loaded on the left side of the section at this time so brown ate dinner. brown asked rocky to help him with the second cut to be taken out of the 3 right crosscut because the first cut was not properly centered and brown considered rocky a more experienced continuous mining machine operator. brown stated that rocky cut about half the place and went to eat dinner. brown finished cutting the left side of the place. after finishing the cut, brown backed the miner into the no. 3 entry just outby the last open crosscut to allow the roof bolting machine operators to bolt the new cut in the 3 right crosscut. todd meadows operated the left, or operator's side of the fletcher dual head roof bolting machine and rocky meadows operated the right, or off side of the machine. the roof bolting machine was moved into position in the 3 right crosscut. the roof bolting crew installed two rows of roof support and todd trammed the roof bolting machine forward in preparation of installing a third row. rocky, off-side operator, guided the machine into place as it was trammed forward. rocky used a piece of key steel welded on top of the canopy as a reference point when guiding the bolt machine into position. when the piece of key steel was positioned underneath the last installed roof bolt, he signaled todd to stop tramming the machine forward. this ensured that the distance between the rows of roof bolts did not exceed 4 feet. todd then set the atrs of the roof bolting machine against the mine roof. this was the normal procedure for advancing the roof bolting machine in the face areas. rocky stated that he made a visual observation of the roof conditions and listened to the roof as the atrs was set. he did not detect any adverse roof conditions during either test. he did not observe any loose rock that had fallen when they pulled into the second cut. the crew members were in the following locations immediately prior to the accident. thomas arms, shuttle car operator, and robert deel, utility man, were located two crosscuts outby the face of the no. 2 entry at the dinner area. billy brown, was operating the right side continuous mining machine, rick l. koeger, section electrician, and curtis gibson, section foreman, were located near the right side continuous mining machine which was located in the no. 3 entry just outby the last open crosscut and approximately 170 feet from the accident site. matt sutherland, right side roof bolting machine operator, was operating a hauler in the no. 2 heading, tim boggs, hauler operator, was at the feeder in the no. 3 entry, roby thomas, right side continuous mining machine operator, was operating the continuous mining machine in the no. 2 heading and william rasnake, scoop operator, was in the no. 3 entry inby the feeder. after the atrs was set, both todd and rocky began to mark roof and rib bolt placement with their chalk sticks. a chalk mark was found on the rib and on a piece of the fallen rock on the operator's side (todd's side). rocky stated that after he finished marking bolts on the off-side, he turned his back to todd to place his marking stick up against the rib. while his back was turned he heard the roof fall. he stated that when he turned around he could not see todd. he yelled for todd but heard no answer. rocky ran over to the operator's side of the machine and tried to get todd to respond. there was no rock on todd. when todd did not respond he yelled for help. brown, gibson and koeger heard rocky yelling and saw him running out of 3 right crosscut. gibson and brown ran toward 3 right and koeger went toward the dinner area to get the first-aid supplies. when gibson and brown got to the roof bolting machine, gibson told brown to call outside and tell them about the accident. on the way to the phone brown ran into rasnake and told him to get the first-aid kit. brown traveled to the feeder, located in no. 3 entry, called outside and informed security about the accident. the dismal river rescue squad was informed of the accident at 1:11 p.m. and was en route to the mine at 1:14 p.m. brown told boggs to try to contact archie ruble, mine foreman, and have the track cleared. rasnake traveled toward the first-aid supplies located in no. 2 entry. he saw arms and deel sitting at the dinner area. he yelled for them to bring the first-aid supplies to 3 right crosscut. koeger arrived at the dinner hole at this time and informed arms and deel of the accident. the three men took the first-aid supplies to 3 right crosscut. rasnake was at the roof bolting machine with curtis gibson when the men arrived with the first-aid supplies. rasnake, certified in advanced first-aid, took charge of caring for the victim. he instructed gibson to bandage the cut on the victim's head while he prepared the victim to be loaded onto the backboard. the victim was loaded onto the backboard and taken to the mantrip. rasnake stated that when they got to the mantrip he checked the victim for a pulse. at that time he was breathing and had a pulse. when they got to the mouth of 12 right panel, rasnake told brown, who was operating the mantrip, to cut it off so he could check for a pulse. rasnake could not find a pulse at this time so he started cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (cpr) on the victim. they continued toward the surface and near 11 right panel, ruble got on the mantrip to help rasnake. ruble gave rescue breaths while rasnake continued chest compressions. rasnake and ruble continued to perform cpr until they arrived on the surface at 1:47 p.m. and turned the victim over to the dismal river rescue squad. the rescue squad left mine property at 1:49 p.m. transporting the victim to clinch valley medical center located in richlands, virginia. todd meadows was pronounced dead at 2:07 p.m. by the emergency room physician.

day shift crew entered the mine. the no. 3 unit crew, including section foreman travis burkett and roof bolting machine operator justin wilkin (victim), traveled to the unit. wilkin normally operated the left boom of the roof bolting machine on the right side of the no. 3 unit. the second operator of the roof bolting machine was absent. david worstell was contacted by the outby lead man and instructed to travel from the no. 2 unit to no. 3 unit to fill in on the right side bolter. travis burkett checked the section power center and feeder. he then checked all of the faces beginning on the left side of the unit in #10 entry. burkett finished examining the faces in #1 entry at about 7:30 a.m. jesse fifer was moving the continuous miner out of the #1 entry at this time. travis burkett traveled outby and encountered justin wilkin at his roof bolting machine in #4 entry. wilkin told burkett that he was going to set the bolter up in #1 entry. burkett continued outby to the section power center area to update the section escapeway map. worstell arrived on the unit, encountering burkett at the power center. burkett told worstell he would be operating the roof bolting machine on the right side of the unit. worstell proceeded to the #1 entry where wilkin was operating the fletcher roof ranger double-boom roof bolter alone. he had installed two roof bolts on the left side of the entry and was in the process of installing the roof bolt closest to the rib on the right side of the entry. wilkin finished installing the bolt nearest to the rib on the right side and swung the roof bolting machine boom inward. worstell thought that wilkin was going to install the center roof bolt. worstell was standing on the right side near the middle of the machine cutting the wires from bundles of roof bolts and bearing plates. very shortly after wilkin swung the boom in, worstell heard a rock fall. he looked toward the front of the machine and did not see wilkin's light. worstell ran to the front of the roof bolter and observed wilkin pinned by a rock against the atrs raise cylinder. worstell attempted to lift the rock off of wilkin, but could not. worstell ran from the #1 entry to #2 entry and shouted to several crew members standing in the #4 entry that wilkin was covered up and he needed help. coal transporter operator chris richardson retrieved his walkie-talkie from his coal transporter and informed travis burkett about the accident. burkett traveled from the power center area to #1 entry. as burkett arrived at the roof bolter, he met fifer running from the #1 entry. fifer said he was going to get more help to move the rock. fifer proceeded to the #9 entry and obtained the unit's left side crew members for assistance. the crew members were finally able to lift the rock enough for burkett to pull wilkin free. wilkin (victim) was unresponsive and did not have a pulse. the victim was placed on a backboard and carried around the left side of the roof bolter where he was placed on a stretcher. the stretcher was carried to the rear of the roof bolter. fifer and continuous miner operator adam harvey began cpr on the victim. the victim was placed on a battery golf cart and transported to the mine haul road. the mine's underground ambulance met the golf cart two crosscuts outby the unit. the victim was transferred to the ambulance and transported to the surface, arriving outside at 8:09 a.m. gibson county, indiana ems transported the victim to the gibson county hospital where he was pronounced dead at 8:34 a.m.

foreman, joey kennedy and robbie cantrell, continuous mining machine operators, greg hensley and kevin justice, roof bolting machine operators, josh tomblin and dave m. runyon, shuttle car operators, elbert j. clay, scoop operator, and nathan dove, electrician, left the surface at the melville box cut and traveled to the no. 3 working section via a rail-mounted personnel carrier. they arrived on the section at 3:20 p.m., and met with the day shift crew that was still on the section. after a brief discussion with the day shift crew, they continued to the face and started their normal mining process. the day shift crew then left the section and traveled to the surface using the rail-mounted personnel carrier that the second shift had used to travel to the section. when the second shift crew arrived on the section, the no. 1 shuttle car was located in the 4 right crosscut with all of the cable pulled off the reel and lying on the mine floor. the car had not operated for several hours on the day shift because of electrical problems. the day shift had reported that the shuttle car had been repaired. the second shift discovered that the shuttle car was still having electrical problems and dove started the repairs. jeff ballintine, the day shift electrician, had just left the section, but forgot his dinner bucket and came back to the section to get it. he then discovered that the no. 1 shuttle car was still down and he decided to stay back and help repair the shuttle car. the day shift crew then left the section. it was determined that the cable reel needed to be replaced and the no. 1 shuttle car needed to be moved out of the way for production purposes. dove and ballintine electrically bypassed the defective reel and the shuttle car was relocated to the no. 5 entry just outby the section loading point. dove then deenergized the no. 1 shuttle car, disconnected the disconnecting device, and locked it out with his lock. dove and ballintine then began replacing the defective reel. production began in the no. 1 entry with the left side continuous mining machine. the cut was finished and the mining machine was moved to the no. 3 entry which was then mined. the right side continuous mining machine subsequently mined the no. 7 entry, while the left side continuous mining machine was moved to the 3 left crosscut. the 3 left crosscut was mined and the left side continuous mining machine was then moved to the no. 4 entry. while moving the left side continuous mining machine to the no. 4 entry, the machine was backed into the 4 right crosscut, where it ran over the cable for the no. 1 shuttle car, thereby damaging the cable. dove came to the 4 right crosscut to repair the no. 1 shuttle car cable. ballintine came to the crosscut to tell dove that he was leaving. ballintine left the section and walked to the surface. while dove completed the repairs on the no. 1 shuttle car cable, kennedy, left continuous mining machine operator, and tomblin, no. 2 shuttle car operator, mined the no. 4 entry. shortly thereafter, the no. 2 shuttle car lost power and shut down as it was about to leave the left continuous mining machine. the lights on the no. 2 shuttle car went out when the power was lost. kennedy and tomblin looked inside the reel compartment of the no. 2 shuttle car where they detected a burning smell from damaged phase conductors. dove and cantrell also came to the no. 2 shuttle car. tomblin showed dove the damaged cable inside the cable reel compartment. tomblin assisted dove in pulling the remaining 30 to 40 feet of cable from the reel, without first disconnecting, locking out, and tagging the disconnecting device for the no. 2 shuttle car. cantrell went to the right side continuous mining machine to begin mining in the no. 6 entry. tomblin and dove removed the cover from the top of the reel compartment. the strain clamp for the cable was also removed at this time. dove asked dave r. runyon to look at the damaged cable in order to show him the extent of damage. dove wanted to assure that dave r. runyon realized the damaged area would have to be removed and the trailing cable re-entered into the reel. dave r. runyon agreed to the needed repair and left the immediate area. dove continued making the repairs to the cable without deenergizing the circuit and locking out and tagging the disconnecting device to the no. 2 shuttle car. kennedy and tomblin remained in the area. at approximately 8:45 pm, dove cut into the white electrical phase conductor. as dave r. runyon traveled down the no. 4 entry toward the feeder, he looked back toward the shuttle car and observed dove leaning over the cable reel compartment, convulsing as if being shocked. dave r. runyon yelled for someone to pull the power and yelled for kennedy to get dove out of the power. kennedy attempted to pull dove by his light cord, but the battery came out of the pouch and his hard hat fell. he then grabbed dove's mine belt straps, pulled, and they both fell back against the coal rib. dove appeared to gasp for a couple of breaths, and then was unresponsive. dave r. runyon instructed tomblin to go to the section transformer and deenergize the no. 2 shuttle car. tomblin rushed to the transformer and tripped an undetermined number of circuit breakers on the side of the transformer, opposite from where the shuttle cars circuit breakers were located. dave r. runyon and kennedy immediately started cpr. as others on the section became aware of the accident, the dispatcher was notified, a backboard and additional first aid supplies were obtained, and additional persons assisted in transporting dove to the end of the track on the section. during a trip past the section transformer, david m. runyon noticed that the no. 2 shuttle car circuit breaker was still closed (energized). he pressed the test button to trip the circuit breaker and deenergized the shuttle car. tim dingess, outby electrician, kennedy, and dave r. runyon transported dove to the surface on a rail-mounted personnel carrier while continuing cpr. once on the surface, dove was transported to the logan general hospital in logan, west virginia, by the l.e.s.a. ambulance service. the victim was pronounced dead at 9:30 p.m. by hospital personnel.

on tuesday, april 22, 2008, at approximately 6:30 a.m., the day shift crew, under the direction of john mullins, section foreman, entered the mine via a diesel-powered, rubber-tired, self-propelled mantrip. they arrived on the active working 001 section at about 6:50 a.m. and began normal operations. the crew members were in the following locations before the accident. charles fields jr., section mechanic, was in the #2 entry at the left-side continuous mining machine replacing worn bits. dennis gibson, shuttle car operator, was unloading his shuttle car at the feeder in the #4 entry. curtis fleenor and walter gibson, roof bolting machine operators, were installing roof support in the #4 left crosscut. james ramey ii, scoop operator, was in the #4 left crosscut assembling roof bolts. he was waiting to clean the area. mullins was in the face of the #4 entry waiting for the roof bolting crew to finish in the #4 left crosscut so he could prepare that area for the next cut. the right-side roof bolting machine was parked in the crosscut between #6 and #7 entries. eric stallard, utility man, had trammed a scoop loaded with supplies to this roof bolting machine. christopher huff and david sizemore, roof bolting machine operators were located at the roof bolting machine. sizemore was operating the right-side roof bolting machine on this shift because the employee normally assigned to this job was absent. sizemore's normal duties were to operate a diesel-powered, rubber-tired, self-propelled tractor and clean around the belt conveyor system. the ventilating air from #7 entry face, where mining was on-going, was traveling through the crosscut from the #6 to the #7 entry. sizemore indicated he wanted to get away from the dust being created by the operation of the continuous mining machine. huff and sizemore went to the #7 entry to talk with marvin music, mining machine operator. after some discussion, huff returned to the roof bolting machine and sizemore remained in the #7 entry. while music was operating the continuous mining machine, huff and stallard went outby the working area in the #6 entry to avoid the dusty environment. in between the operation of the continuous mining machine, huff and stallard would load supplies onto the roof bolting machine. they also went to speak with roger mccoy, shuttle car operator, and then returned to the roof bolting machine. music was using the remotely controlled continuous mining machine in the #7 entry. he had finished the cut, backed out and cut the left-side corner. he repositioned the mining machine back into the #7 entry and was loading coal and rock onto a shuttle car. mccoy was maneuvering the shuttle car behind the continuous mining machine. sizemore was standing closely behind music's right side along the right rib of the #7 entry about 17.5 feet outby the last row of permanently installed roof support. the miners were about 100 feet inby survey spad 597. at approximately 8:55 a.m., rock fell from the mine roof and rib between the right rib and three installed roof bolts. one of the roof bolts broke at the time of the fall (see photograph 2). the portion of the mine roof and rib that fell, striking both miners, measured approximately 6 feet long and was 3 feet wide at the inby end and 19 inches wide at the outby end by up to14 inches thick. music was thrown toward the shuttle car as the rock hit his right shoulder. sizemore fell onto his left side and against the rib as the rock hit him. the rock came to rest on the lower part of his legs. as music was getting up, he and mccoy yelled for help. mccoy and music went to aid sizemore. huff heard the call for help and ran to get mullins and other crew members. stallard went to the accident scene. he, mccoy and music lifted the rock and pulled sizemore's legs from under it. huff found mullins in the #4 entry and notified him of the accident. mullins proceeded to the accident scene. d. gibson saw someone running, thought there was an accident, and went to the right-side continuous mining machine. huff went to the left-side roof bolting machine and notified fleenor, w. gibson, and ramey. the three miners, along with huff, proceeded to the accident scene. music told stallard to call outside and inform them of the accident. he also told stallard to have someone bring the first-aid kit, backboard and mantrip. the mine phone was located in the #4 entry, outby the belt conveyor feeder. stallard, on the way to the phone, met the other miners near the #6 entry. he told them to get the first-aid kit, backboard and mantrip. mullins arrived at the accident scene and assessed the situation. he also shouted for the miners to bring the first-aid kit and mantrip. mullins left the #7 entry and traveled toward the phone. d. gibson followed stallard as he continued to the phone. d. gibson called outside to hagy barnett, superintendent, and informed him of the accident. barnett asked if sizemore was conscious and if he needed a med-flight. d. gibson left the phone and relayed the questions to mullins, who was coming to the phone. mullins said sizemore was conscious and to get the med-flight. d. gibson went back to the phone and relayed the message. mullins and stallard started back to the accident scene. at 8:59 a.m., barnett called the 911 emergency number and requested an ambulance and med-flight. barnett told allen wolfe, outside man, about the accident and that an ambulance and med-flight were on the way. wolfe began to monitor the phones. barnett gathered his gear and proceeded underground on a mantrip. after meeting stallard in the #6 entry, w. gibson and ramey went to the power center in the #5 entry and fleenor went to the mantrip. w. gibson and ramey picked up the first-aid kit and backboard and traveled to the accident scene. first-aid was administered to control the bleeding and they made sizemore as comfortable as possible. fields, unaware of the accident, started toward the #4 entry to get tools. when he reached the #4 entry, d. gibson informed him of the accident. fields encountered stallard as they both were traveling to the accident scene. fleenor moved the mantrip closer to the accident scene. sizemore refused to let the miners put a neck brace on him. the fallen rock impeded the placement of the backboard even after the rock was slightly moved. sizemore's extraction was also delayed because he initially refused to be put on the backboard. the miners were able to place sizemore on the backboard on his left side and carried him to the mantrip. as they were leaving, barnett arrived on the section. at 9:28 a.m., wolfe recorded that sizemore was being transported to the surface. barnett followed sizemore's mantrip, stopping at each belt drive to call to the surface and make wolfe aware of their location. fields, huff, mccoy, and ramey rode the mantrip with sizemore while music trammed it to the surface. ramey continued to administer care to sizemore while others on the mantrip stabilized him. during the trip, sizemore asked to stop the mantrip to catch his breath. music complied with the request and stopped for about 30 seconds. wolfe recorded that sizemore arrived outside at 9:54 a.m. sizemore's care was transferred to rescue personnel from appalachia rescue squad (ars) and med-flight. medical care was provided including cardio pulmonary resuscitation (cpr). they decided to transport him by ambulance to holston valley medical center (hvmc) in kingsport, tennessee. ars's ambulance left the mine site at 10:22 a.m. with sizemore. they decided to transfer sizemore to the med-flight at wellmont lonesome pine hospital (wlph) in big stone gap, virginia. they arrived at wlph's helipad at 10:33 a.m. at 11:01 a.m., the med-flight arrived at hvmc. sizemore was pronounced dead at hvmc at 11:15 a.m., by dr. george testerman.

Strip, Texas|Coal|Energy Future Holdings Corporation|Coal (Lignite)|2008-01-12T05:07:00-05:00|Texas|Texas|"the night shift crew started at 11:00 p.m., on january 11, 2008. larry nelson, operations supervisor, assigned thomas farmer, shovel operator and victim, to operate the no. 51 hitachi ex-1800 shovel loading overburden in pit 11, area g. alton clifton and wade amerson, truck drivers, were assigned to haul the overburden. jack newsom, bulldozer operator, was assigned to push down the east side working face to a safe height of approximately 20 feet. at approximately 12:00 a.m., nelson conducted the on-shift examination of pit 11, area g. at that time, he observed that the south highwall was too high and unstable. he assigned newsom to push (slope) down the south highwall to a safe height. at the time, loading operations were proceeding north along the working face away from the south highwall. normal mining operations proceeded from 12:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. at approximately 3:30 a.m., digging on the north end of the east working face was completed and the shovel was moved to the southeast corner to start another pass on the working face. at this time, newsom started to push down the east corner of the south highwall and later attempted to push down material from the top of the south highwall. due to standing water on top of the south highwall, newsom feared he would get the bulldozer stuck if he continued working there. newsom called nelson on the radio but was not sure if nelson received the message that he could not continue pushing material from the top of the south highwall. the 5:00 a.m. break was close, so newsom pulled away from the south highwall and started to push down the east highwall until break time. he was waiting to receive further instructions from nelson concerning the south highwall. at 5:00 a.m., the fifteen minute break started. the truck operators took their break at the truck dump. newsom took his break on top of the east working face. farmer shut off all lights on the shovel and started his break. during the break, farmer exited the shovel and was between the shovel tracks and the south highwall when the highwall failed and trapped him against the tracks. it appeared that farmer exited the shovel to take a toilet break beside the shovel. at 5:18 a.m., amerson returned from break. the shovel lights were still off, so amerson threw some pennies at the window of the cab to get farmer's attention. clifton arrived with his truck and used the truck lights to illuminate the shovel, flashing the high beam lights on and off. when this caused no reaction from farmer, clifton asked johnny nordin, blade operator who was heading west on the haul road, to call farmer on his cell phone, but this was unsuccessful. newsom, hearing the communication, turned his bulldozer to also illuminate the shovel. amerson then boarded the shovel to look for farmer. not finding him, he returned to his truck and called clifton on the radio and asked him to call nelson to see if farmer had been taken to the rest room or was with nelson. nelson responded that he was not with farmer. after amerson determined that farmer was not with nelson, he exited his truck to look for him. at the time, daryl watkins, fuel truck operator, was heading to the shop and heard that farmer was missing. he turned the fuel truck around and drove to the no. 51 shovel. watkins arrived at 5:30 a.m. and met amerson coming off his truck. watkins, with a flashlight in hand, walked around to the south side of the shovel with amerson where they found farmer buried up to his head and unresponsive to verbal communication. watkins ran to the north side of the shovel and called out for help. clifton, who was standing near the shovel, ran to the fuel truck and made a general call for assistance on the radio. he then returned to assist watkins and amerson, who were giving artificial ventilation breaths to farmer. nelson arrived at the shovel at approximately 5:35 a.m. and found amerson and watkins digging fallen material away from farmer with their hands and hard hats and clifton giving artificial ventilation. nelson immediately called 911 emergency number and mark barton, operations/maintenance manager. nelson directed rescue operations, calling for hand shovels and using other personnel who had arrived to watch the highwall for possible additional falling material. newsom brought the bulldozer down from the east working face to the south side of the shovel to illuminate the rescue area and to try and remove fallen material. however, he stopped removing material as it was thought that the vibrations of the bulldozer could cause more material to fall from the highwall. hank kyle, no. 54 shovel operator and an emt, arrived to help with rescue efforts. kyle relieved clifton giving artificial ventilation and started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) once material had been removed from farmer's waist. cpr was continued until the hopkins county ems arrived at 5:48 a.m. after the hopkins county ems arrived, it was determined that farmer could not be resuscitated. farmer was removed from the fallen material at 6:32 a.m. and was pronounced dead by the hopkins county justice of the peace at 6:43 a.m.
