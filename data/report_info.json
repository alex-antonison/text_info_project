Gilman, Quarry Manager; Paul Tipper, Equipment Operator; and Gary L. McAllister, Equipment Operator, arrived at 7:00 a.m. for the morning shift. \u00a0Tipper began operating the excavator and noticed there was a hydraulic oil leak in the mechanism that latched the hammer to the quick coupler.\u00a0 Tipper notified Gilman of the leak, and Gilman and McAllister examined the equipment. They were unable to find the cause and location of the hydraulic oil leak. \u00a0To prevent further leakage, Gilman removed the two hydraulic oil hoses connected to the quick coupler latching mechanism and load-locking valve arrangement.\u00a0 Gilman then covered (capped) the two ports on the load-locking valve arrangement of the quick coupler and the two hydraulic supply ports on the excavator boom.At approximately 10:45 a.m., Charbonneau arrived at the mine site and Gilman and McAllister informed him that the hydraulic ports had been capped.\u00a0 He spoke with Gilman and McAllister about the decision to cap the hydraulic ports.\u00a0 The three men examined the latching mechanism before deciding to proceed. McAllister moved the excavator from the quarry to the crusher and informed Root that the hydraulic ports had been capped. \u00a0Root then began operating the excavator.Charbonneau and McAllister walked to the crusher work platform to guide the excavator into position to remove the old motor.\u00a0 Charbonneau was standing next to the crusher booth on the east side of the platform.\u00a0 McAllister was standing on the west side of the platform, just above the crusher flywheel (see Appendix A). \u00a0Root began to position the excavator\u2019s boom and hammer while Charbonneau and McAllister directed him with hand signals. \u00a0Charbonneau was standing below the hammer, which was approximately 7.5 feet above the work platform.\u00a0 When Root rotated the hammer to the horizontal position, the hammer fell from the quick coupler, striking Charbonneau in the head, knocking him down, and pinning him to the work platform.McAllister yelled for help.\u00a0 Gilman, who was returning from parking his truck, grabbed a chain and used it to attach the hammer to the excavator boom.\u00a0 Root used the excavator to lift the hammer off of Charbonneau.\u00a0 Miners were not able to completely remove Charbonneau from under the hammer until additional equipment was brought to the site.\u00a0 The additional equipment was needed because the excavator did not have the lifting capacity due to the loss of hydraulic oil.At approximately 11:55 a.m., Gilman called 911 and requested medical assistance.\u00a0 At 12:03 p.m., emergency medical crews arrived at the mine site, and at 12:13 p.m., Steven Stryker, AmCare Ambulance Paramedic, pronounced the victim dead do to extensive trauma.", "INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT": "At 12:14 p.m., Gilman called the Department of Labor National Contact Center (DOLNCC).\u00a0 The DOLNCC notified Dennis Yesko, MSHA\u2019s Northeastern District Assistant District Manager, who dispatched John Burton, Mine Safety and Health Inspector, to the mine site.\u00a0 Upon arrival, Burton secured the scene and ensured the safety of the miners.\u00a0At 5:11 p.m., Everett G. Kinser and Daniel F. Pullen, Mine Safety and Health Inspectors in MSHA\u2019s Portsmouth, New Hampshire field office, arrived on the scene to conduct the fatal accident investigation.\u00a0 Upon arrival, Kinser issued a 103(k) order.\u00a0 MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team conducted a physical examination of the accident scene, interviewed five mine employees and seven contractor employees, reviewed training documentation, and examined work procedures relevant to the accident.\u00a0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, mine employees, local law enforcement, and rescue agencies.\u00a0 See Appendix B for a list of persons participating in the investigation.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of AccidentThe accident occurred on the west side of the crusher control booth on a Cedarapids portable jaw crusher work platform (see Appendix C).WeatherThe weather at the time of the accident was cloudy with an average temperature of 80\u00b0 F. \u00a0Investigators did not consider weather to be a factor in the accident.Equipment InvolvedThe equipment involved in the accident was a Caterpillar 325B L excavator, product identification number 2JR02784. \u00a0At the time of the accident, the excavator was equipped with a Fleco 325B C-linkage quick coupler and a Gorilla GHB150 hydraulic hammer (see Appendix D).\u00a0 This attachment assembly was provided and installed by Perry\u2019s Equipment Inc. of Swanton, Vermont several years prior to the accident.The hammer was secured to the excavator\u2019s quick coupler by a latch.\u00a0 The hammer has a carrier on one side that connects to the quick coupler, and the latch holds the hammer\u2019s carrier securely.\u00a0 Two systems cause the latch to remain closed and hold the hammer\u2019s carrier securely.\u00a0 The two systems are the primary latching system and the secondary latching system.Primary Latching SystemThe primary latching system is controlled by a hydraulic cylinder. \u00a0When the hydraulic cylinder is extended, it closes the latch, and when the hydraulic cylinder is retracted, it opens the latch.\u00a0 The primary latching system is designed so that hydraulic pressure, on the extend side of the hydraulic cylinder, causes the hydraulic cylinder to keep the latch in the closed position at all times when the excavator is operating.\u00a0 The latch will remain closed unless a series of switches inside the cab are used to open the latch. \u00a0A check valve prevents the latch from opening if hydraulic power to the extend side of the hydraulic cylinder is lost.Disconnected and Damaged Hydraulic SystemAs mentioned earlier, Gilman removed the two hydraulic hoses connected to the hydraulic cylinder from the excavator and installed caps on all four fittings. In addition, investigators found that the tube welded to the extend side of the hydraulic cylinder was cracked and the tube welded to the retract side of the hydraulic cylinder was broken into two pieces. This defeated the load locking valve feature for the latch and allowed a constant flow of hydraulic oil to leak (see Appendices F and G).Secondary Latching SystemA secondary latching system used a safety pin arrangement to mechanically keep the latch from opening (see Appendices E and H).\u00a0 The safety pin can be inserted into one of two holes in excavator\u2019s quick coupler.\u00a0 The proper hole depends on the amount of separation of the two pins in the hammer\u2019s carrier.\u00a0 The operator\u2019s manual for the quick coupler indicated that the maximum recommended pin separation for the type of pins in the hammer\u2019s carrier, is 475 mm.\u00a0 The separation of the pins in hammer\u2019s carrier was 520 mm which circumvented the safety pin as a secondary means of securely holding the hammer\u2019s carrier. \u00a0\u00a0SummaryWhen Root rotated the hammer to the horizontal position, the weight of the hammer on the latch and hydraulic cylinder forced hydraulic oil out of the cracked tube and through a broken weld where the load locking valve arrangement was welded in place.\u00a0 As the hydraulic oil evacuated the tube, the latch opened. \u00a0The secondary means also failed due to the incompatibility of the quick coupler and hammer\u2019s carrier. \u00a0The hammer fell because the primary and secondary latching systems could not serve their intended function.Training and ExperienceCharbonneau had over 14 years of mining experience, all with Northeast.\u00a0 MSHA determined there were no contributory training deficiencies.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "The accident investigation team conducted a root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the accident.\u00a0 The team identified the following root causes and the mine operator implemented the corresponding corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\u00a0 The accident occurred because the operator did not repair the disconnected and damaged hydraulic cylinder assembly for the quick coupler or remove it from service after discovering a hydraulic oil leak.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The quick coupler involved in the accident was removed from service.\u00a0 Mine management and miners have been reinstructed on the provisions of 30 CFR \u00a7 56.14100 including the removal of unsafe equipment that affects the safety of miners.Root Cause:\u00a0 The accident occurred because the operator used an incompatible carrier attachment. \u00a0The mismatched equipment components circumvented the secondary latching system allowing the hammer to disengage from the quick coupler when the primary means of latching failed.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 Management removed the quick coupler from the excavator and adopted a policy eliminating the use of quick coupling devices at this operation. \u00a0The operator will ensure that all equipment is used within the design capacity of the manufacturer.", "CONCLUSION": "Ryan I.

ACCIDENT": "On June 10, 2019, Sawasky arrived at the mine site at 6:00 a.m., to continue installing electrical lines for a new plant.\u00a0 Premier\u2019s Foreman, Greg Turcotte, met with Sawasky and Travis Hegemann, Journeyman Electrician, to conduct the morning safety briefing and discuss the day\u2019s tasks.\u00a0 The three men walked over to a trench for electrical lines, to see the impact of a recent rain event.Turcotte determined the trench was too muddy to work safely, so he coordinated with Joseph Peters, Plant Manager, to remove the mud.\u00a0 Peters used an excavator to clear the mud from the trench.\u00a0 He also placed a six-by-two-foot concrete block at the head of the trench to serve as a mounting structure for an electrical junction box.\u00a0 Before leaving the area, Turcotte coordinated with Peters to replace the mud with crushed rock.\u00a0 Turcotte then left the mine site to obtain additional construction material.\u00a0 Bruce Batson, Maintenance/Equipment Operator, delivered approximately half a bucket of crushed stone using a Caterpillar 980H front-end loader.\u00a0 He put some stone into the trench and dumped the remainder along the trench for later placement.Hegemann coordinated with Peters to bring an additional four loads of crusher fines to the trench to use as bedding for the conduit.\u00a0 Peters operated a Wacker Neuson WL36 front-end loader to deliver the crusher fines from a nearby stockpile. \u00a0A pile of crushed rock, other materials, and equipment in front of and adjacent to the trench impeded Peters\u2019 approach to the trench.\u00a0 Peters had to approach the trench at about a 30-degree angle and then turn to the right, which placed the bucket of the front-end loader parallel to the trench (see Appendix A).Hegemann acted as a spotter for Peters when he dumped the first three buckets of crusher fines into the trench. \u00a0After Peters dumped the third bucket of crusher fines, Hegemann got in the trench to mount steel struts to the concrete block for the junction box.\u00a0 Sawasky stood next to him, assisting.\u00a0 Hegemann was not spotting when Peters delivered the fourth load.At approximately 11:10 a.m., as Peters was preparing to dump the fourth load, the right-front wheel of the front-end loader went over the edge and into the trench.\u00a0 Peters yelled out a warning and Hegemann jumped back out of the way.\u00a0 The front-end loader rolled and slid down into the trench, with its bumper coming to rest on the concrete block.Hegemann watched Peters climb out of the front-end loader cab and then turned to see that Sawasky was pinned between the front-end loader and the concrete block.\u00a0 Hegemann called to Turcotte, who had returned to the site, to call 911.\u00a0 He then climbed to the top of the block and tried to speak to Sawasky, who was not responsive.Peters assisted emergency medical services by using a large excavator to lift the fallen front-end loader to free Sawasky at 11:25 a.m.\u00a0 Kelli Derleth, Medicolegal Death Investigator, examined Sawasky and pronounced him dead at 12:06 p.m.\u00a0", "INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT": "At 11:31 a.m., Brandon Clemons, Vulcan\u2019s Safety Representative, called the Department of Labor\u2019s National Contact Center (DOLNCC).\u00a0 At 11:43 a.m., the DOLNCC contacted David Allen, MSHA Southeastern District Safety Specialist, who dispatched Scottie Sizemore, Mine Safety and Health Inspector, and Darren Conn, Supervisory Mine Safety and Health Inspector, in MSHA\u2019s Franklin, Tennessee field office, to the mine site.\u00a0 Sizemore and Conn arrived at 1:24 p.m., and issued an order under Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to secure the scene and ensure the safety of miners.Rory Smith, Supervisory Mine Safety and Health Inspector, in MSHA\u2019s Birmingham, Alabama field office and Kevin Hardester, Mine Safety and Health Inspector, arrived on the scene at 4:30 p.m., to conduct a fatal injury accident investigation.\u00a0 MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team conducted a physical examination of the accident scene, interviewed five mine employees and seven contractor employees, reviewed training documentation, and examined work procedures relevant to the accident.\u00a0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, miners, and contractors. \u00a0See Appendix B for a list of persons participating in the investigation.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of AccidentThe accident occurred in an area where the operator was building a secondary processing plant.\u00a0 The electrical contractors were preparing to place electrical conduit and a junction box in a trench at the perimeter of the new plant site.\u00a0 The trench was approximately seven-feet wide and ranged from four to six feet deep.\u00a0 The walls were slightly sloped (see Appendix C), and there was a shallow ramp at the head of the trench for access.\u00a0EquipmentA Wacker Neuson WL36, front-end loader, Serial #3025335, with a bucket capacity of .8 cubic yards was involved in the accident (see Appendix D). \u00a0\u00a0River Road Quarry has only one front-end loader of this model and they have trained multiple miners to operate it.\u00a0 There were no documented mechanical issues with the front-end loader.\u00a0 Maintenance records did not indicate any current or recurring issues.\u00a0 After inspecting pre-operational examination records and conducting interviews, the accident investigators concluded that the mine operator was performing required examinations and there were no reported safety defects or concerns prior to the accident.Weather ConditionsThe weather at the time of the accident was mostly cloudy, no precipitation, and a temperature of 77\u00b0 F. \u00a0Rainfall over the previous weekend made further excavation of the trench necessary to correct the muddy conditions.\u00a0 Investigators did not consider the weather to be a factor in the accident.Training and ExperiencePeters received training in operating the front-end loader.\u00a0 He had approximately six months of experience at this site and approximately three years of total mining experience.\u00a0 Collin Sawasky\u2019s training records indicated he had received new miner training; site-specific training; annual refresher training; and task training on various pieces of equipment.\u00a0", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "The accident investigation team conducted a root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the accident.\u00a0 The team identified the following root causes and the mine operator implemented the corresponding corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not maintain control of the front-end loader to prevent overtravel into the trench.\nCorrective Action: The mine operator provided additional training to all equipment operators on how to operate equipment in a safe and controlled manner.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not use berms or other limiting devices to prevent overtravel of equipment when approaching a drop-off to dump material.\nCorrective Action: The mine operator developed and implemented new policies and procedures to ensure miners\u2019 safety when dumping material near an edge of a drop-off, and provided training to miners in the new policies and procedures.", "CONCLUSION": "Collin Sawasky died when a front-end loader toppled into the trench where he and a coworker were installing electrical conduit.\u00a0 The accident occurred because the equipment operator did not maintain control of the front-end loader to prevent overtravel into the trench and the mine operator did not provide berms or other devices to prevent

Huskey directed Dean to go to the section power center to call outside and get first aid supplies. \u00a0At the power center, Dean called David Eldridge, Security Officer, to alert him of the accident and request an ambulance.\u00a0 Eldridge contacted Thomas Loving of Human Resources and Loving called 911, the Department of Labor National Contact Center (DOL Contact Center), and the Kentucky Division of Mine Safety (KDMS).\u00a0Dean also called mine foreman Tommy Vannatter who was on the 001 MMU at the time of the accident. \u00a0T. Vannatter immediately went to help transport North to the surface.When Dean returned to the accident scene, he moved his shuttle car to clear the way for Huskey to pull in with the personnel carrier. \u00a0The crew placed North on the backboard and into the carrier and transported him to the surface. \u00a0North never lost consciousness during this time.After arriving on the surface at 7:08 p.m., North was transferred to medical personnel with LifeGuard Ambulance Service, who transported him about two miles to a designated landing zone.\u00a0 At 7:30 p.m., he was flown by AirMedCare to the Johnson City Medical Center in Johnson City, Tennessee.\u00a0 North underwent several surgical procedures at the Medical Center, and died of complications from his injuries on May 30, 2019. \u00a0", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On May 22, 2019, at 7:30 p.m., Loving notified the DOL Contact Center of a life threatening injury accident.\u00a0 The DOL Contact Center notified Marvin Hoskins, MSHA Hazard, KY Field Office Supervisor (FOS), who in turn notified Craig Plumley, Assistant District Manager for Enforcement. \u00a0Plumley directed William C. Clark, MSHA Barbourville, KY FOS, to travel to the mine and assist with the accident investigation.\u00a0At the time of the accident, Jack Harris, MSHA Inspector, was conducting inspection activities on the 001 MMU. \u00a0As noted earlier, T. Vannatter went to help transport North to the surface as soon as he heard about the accident.\u00a0 When T. Vannatter returned to the 001 MMU, he found Harris, and informed him of the accident. \u00a0Harris and T. Vannatter then traveled to the accident scene. \u00a0At 8 p.m., Harris issued a 103(k) order, conducted an imminent danger run, and took photos and preliminary measurements of the accident scene.\u00a0 Clark arrived at the mine to assist Harris at approximately 9:00 p.m.On May 23, 2019, Dennis Cotton, Assistant District Manager for Technical, Kevin Doan, Roof Control Specialist, and Ricky L. Suffridge, Roof Control Specialist/Accident Investigator traveled to the mine to continue the investigation. \u00a0Cotton and Doan traveled to the accident site with KDMS investigators Billy Allen, Ernest Hawkins, Dustin Clem, and Brandon Morgan, Safety Director for Rex Coal Company, to evaluate the roof and rib conditions. \u00a0Meanwhile, Suffridge traveled to the 001 MMU with Allen Turner, Mine Superintendent, to evaluate roof and rib conditions at that location to see if hazardous conditions extended to the 001 MMU.\u00a0 Later that afternoon, Timothy L. Fugate, Chief Accident Investigator at KDMS, and Clark from MSHA arrived at the mine to join the investigation. \u00a0Investigators conducted preliminary interviews with most of the miners who had worked with North as they arrived for the start of the second shift. \u00a0After completing the interviews, investigators Suffridge, Clark, Fugate, Hawkins, Turner, and Morgan traveled underground to the 002 MMU and took additional photographs and measurements.On May 30, 2019, MSHA was notified that North had passed away at the Johnson City Medical Center.\u00a0 Interviews were conducted on Tuesday, June 4, 2019 at the MSHA Harlan Field Office (see Appendix B).On May 31, 2019 and June 1, 2019, Deborah B. Combs, Training Specialist with MSHA Educational Field and Small Mine Services, reviewed training records at the mine.", "DISCUSSION": "Accident SceneThe accident occurred at the intersection of the No. 3 heading and the No. 3 left crosscut (see Appendix A).\u00a0 During the shift before the accident, the No. 3 heading was mined and the No. 3 left crosscut was mined approximately 20 feet.\u00a0 These mined areas were roof bolted but no rib bolts were installed.Geologic ConditionsThe CVB No. 1 mine extracts coal from the Harlan coal seam and is overlain by abandoned workings in the Creech and High Splint coalbeds.\u00a0 The interburden between the Harlan and Creech coal seams averages 370 feet.\u00a0 The interburden between the Harlan and the High Splint seams averages 1,450 feet.The rock strata at the accident scene consisted of coal, cannel coal, and sandy shale (see Appendix C).\u00a0 The rock that fell onto the victim came from the upper layer of sandy shale, which was 24 inches in width at the scene of the accident.\u00a0 At the scene of the accident, the coal seam was starting to rise in elevation.\u00a0 The elevation in the coal seam at the scene of the accident caused instability, in that the inby crosscut pillar corner leaned toward the continuous mining machine operator\u2019s location.\u00a0Roof Control PlanThe approved roof control plan required rib bolting in areas with specific geological characteristics. \u00a0For example, rib bolting was required where the overburden was 1,000 feet. \u00a0The overburden on the 002 MMU at the time of the accident was 900 feet so it did not meet the criteria requiring rib bolting.ExaminationsInvestigators reviewed preshift and onshift examination records for two months before the fatal accident.\u00a0 Rib hazards were frequently documented in these records.\u00a0 The records, and conditions in the mine, showed that the mine operator scaled loose rock and installed rib bolts as conditions were observed. \u00a0The rib bolts installed were 6-foot fully grouted bolts spaced on 8 foot centers (horizontally).\u00a0 Despite these efforts by the mine operator, rib hazards continued to develop.\u00a0On May 22, 2019, the day of the accident, preshift examination records for the 002 MMU showed two notations regarding ribs: \u201cLoose Rib\u201d under the heading of \u201cHazardous Condition(s)\u201d, and \u201cPulled\u201d under the heading, \u201cAction Taken.\u201d\u00a0 The on-shift examination record for that day listed one remark concerning the ribs, \u201cPulled loose ribs & drawrock.\u201d\u00a0 In preshift and on-shift examination records for the 7 days prior to the accident, there were notations of loose ribs.\u00a0 All of these rib hazards were noted as being pulled down to remove the hazard.\u00a0 The preshift and on-shift examination records were signed and countersigned as required.Post-accident interviews of the 002 MMU miners and supervisor indicated that the rib that caused the accident did not appear hazardous prior to falling.Roof Bolting Machines on the 002 MMUTwo types of roof bolting machines were utilized on the 002 MMU.\u00a0 One machine only installed roof bolts. \u00a0The other bolting machine was a mast-head drill primarily used to install rib bolts.\u00a0 On occasion, if the roof bolting was lagging, the operator would use the mast-head drill to roof bolt and rib bolt.The mine operator was installing rib bolts in the area of the accident.\u00a0 However, rib bolts provide the best protection when they are installed at the same time as roof bolts and in a consistent pattern.\u00a0 Rib bolts on the 002 MMU were not being installed at the same time as the roof bolts.TrainingCombs reviewed training records and determined that North\u2019s training was up-to-date.\u00a0 He had received continuous mining machine task training on December 28, 2018, annual refresher training on October 13, 2018, and experienced miner training on November 11, 2018.\u00a0 Combs determined all 29 second shift employees\u2019 training records were up-to-date and found no training deficiencies.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 A root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.\u00a0Listed below is the root cause identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions which were implemented to prevent a recurrence.\u00a0Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not effectively control the ribs and pillar corners on the 002 MMU in areas where the miners were working and traveling to protect them from hazards related to falls of the ribs.\u00a0 A portion of a coal/rock rib weighing about 2,000 pounds and measuring 48-to-54 inches long, 24 inches wide, and 28 inches thick fell on the 002

(See Appendix B). West Amarillo installed the cone crusher and a new feed belt between May 2, 2019 and May 5, 2019, and started operating them on May 6, 2019. \u00a0The mine encountered material flow problems with the feed belt and feed box from the beginning and made several modifications to try to resolve the issues. \u00a0When a stoppage occurred, miners accessed the feed box from above by using a personnel lift, or from the crusher platform below, using a steel pry bar to break the stoppage loose.\u00a0\u00a0Personnel LiftThe personnel lift is a Snorkel Model # TB-60D7, Serial # MY07112 (See Appendix C). \u00a0At the time of the accident, the bottom of the basket was 28 feet above the ground. \u00a0The boom was extended to a length of 37 feet, 2 inches, measured from the rear boom pin to the basket pin. \u00a0Activity Involved in the AccidentThe investigation team concluded that Ramirez would have positioned the basket directly above the cone crusher to access the feed box.\u00a0 The team found a pry bar and belt scraper bushing on the ground approximately 31 feet from the platform.\u00a0 In interviews, miners said that in the past, miners used the pry bar to free blockage in the cone crusher feed box.The basket\u2019s torque plate was found to be damaged which caused the basket to move laterally, uncontrolled by the operator.\u00a0 The investigation team could not determine if the damage to the torque plate was the result of the bottom of the basket contacting a dowel pin on top of the cone crusher.\u00a0 Based on witness accounts, Ramirez was tramming the personnel lift away from the cone crusher structure just prior to the accident.\u00a0 Witnesses said the basket appeared to bounce up and down and the victim cartwheeled over the edge of the basket.\u00a0 The terrain, speed, damage to the torque plate, and the boom arm extended 37 feet were factors causing the basket to move in an uncontrolled manner.Fall ProtectionWest Amarillo\u2019s policy states that fall protection must be used where required and the user must be properly tied off in all applicable situations.\u00a0 Ramirez had been trained on this policy.\u00a0 Although the policy did not specifically address tie off procedures in a personnel lift basket, the basket had a label warning equipment operators to wear fall protection at all times. The victim was wearing a fall protection harness and a six foot retractable lanyard, but the lanyard was not tied off at the time of the accident.WeatherThe weather at the time of the accident was clear, with light winds, and a temperature of 51\u02daF.\u00a0 Weather was not a factor in the accident.", "TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE": "In October 2018, Richard E.

Slone (victim) and William McKamey, two contract survey crew members, arrived at the mine.\u00a0 They met with Jack Stump, Owner/Operator, to arrange transportation to the MMU.\u00a0 After arriving on the MMU at 9:15 a.m., they met with H. Randall Hensley, Section Foreman, to get details about where to begin setting survey stations, mapping, and taking mining height measurements.\u00a0 At this time, the continuous mining machine was loading in the No. 3 entry, so the survey crew began in the No. 6 entry and they planned to work toward the No. 4 entry.After lunch, Richard Lane, Shuttle Car Operator, began operating the No. 4 shuttle car and James Barnett, Roof Bolter, began operating the No. 2 shuttle car.\u00a0 Lane drove his shuttle car to the continuous mining machine which was in the left crosscut off the No. 2 entry (see Appendix A).McKamey set the survey instrument in the No. 4 entry and Slone went to the No. 3 entry to take entry height measurements.\u00a0 Slone walked to the front of the No. 2 shuttle car, took a mining height measurement, and then walked 20 feet outby in the No. 3 entry to continue taking measurements.\u00a0After being loaded with coal, Lane drove his shuttle car toward the feeder.\u00a0 At approximately 11:10 a.m., Lane turned into the No. 3 entry and traveled about 10 feet past the inby corner of the pillar and stopped.\u00a0 Lane saw that his shuttle car\u2019s trailing cable was caught around the service jack of Barnett\u2019s shuttle car.\u00a0 Lane and Barnett exited their shuttle cars and freed the cable.\u00a0 Lane continued to the left side of the feeder and Barnett traveled to the continuous mining machine.\u00a0After dumping the load into the feeder, Lane noticed that an electrical cable attached to the mine roof over the feeder was down.\u00a0 He exited his shuttle car and reattached the cable.\u00a0 When he turned around to get back into his shuttle car, he saw Slone lying in the No. 3 entry intersection, adjacent to the feeder.\u00a0 Lane went to Slone and found Slone had been run over by Lane\u2019s shuttle car.\u00a0 Lane then ran and alerted Barnett of the accident.At approximately 11:15 a.m., Lane went to the mine phone adjacent to the feeder and called Michael Runyon, Owner/Operator, and told him that a miner was seriously injured.\u00a0 Next, Lane went to the MMU first aid supplies to retrieve a blanket and a stretcher.\u00a0 Barnett ran and notified McKamey, Hensley, and the other miners of the accident.\u00a0\u00a0Hensley went to the accident scene and realized there was nothing that could be done.\u00a0 He instructed the miners to walk to the surface. McKamey came to the accident scene.\u00a0 Lane arrived with a blanket and they covered Slone.\u00a0 At approximately 11:20 a.m., Lane called outside and told Runyon the victim\u2019s identity and that he was deceased.\u00a0 McKamey and Lane walked to the surface.Runyon informed Stump of the accident then called emergency services.\u00a0 Stump called Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), District 7, Kentucky Division of Mine Safety (KDMS), and the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center.\u00a0MSHA and KDMS personnel arrived at the mine, and traveled to the accident scene with company personnel.\u00a0 Slone was placed on a personnel carrier and transported to the surface.\u00a0 At 11:49 a.m., the Bell County Ambulance Service arrived at the mine.\u00a0 When they arrived, Slone was placed into the ambulance.\u00a0 Jason Steele, Bell County Coroner, arrived shortly after 12:30 p.m., and pronounced Slone dead at 12:35 p.m.\u00a0", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On January 14, 2019, at 11:20 a.m., Stump notified Samuel R. Creasy, MSHA District 7 Manager, and Billy Allen, KDMS Inspector, to report the accident.\u00a0 At 11:25 a.m., Stump notified the DOL National Contact Center (Contact Center) of the accident.\u00a0 The Contact Center notified the District 7 Office at 11:40 a.m.\u00a0 Creasy assigned Ricky L. Suffridge, Roof Control Specialist/Accident Investigator, as the lead accident investigator.\u00a0 Creasy directed Dennis J. Cotton, Assistant District Manager/Technical; Argus Brock, Roof Control Supervisor; William C. Clark, Supervisory Coal Mine Inspector; Ronald D. Caudill, Health Specialist/Accident Investigator; and Sean G. Davenport, Electrical Specialist, to assist in the onsite investigation.\u00a0 They traveled to the mine to begin the accident investigation and were assisted by KDMS.When Suffridge arrived at the mine he issued a 103(k) order to protect the safety of persons at the mine.\u00a0 Brock, Caudill, and Suffridge along with KDMS personnel conducted informal interviews with miners.Once informal interviews were completed, Creasy, Brock, Clark, Suffridge, Caudill, and Davenport traveled underground with mine officials and KDMS investigators.\u00a0 Photographs and measurements of the accident scene were taken.\u00a0On January 15, 2019, Deborah B. Combs, Training Specialist with MSHA Educational Field and Small Mine Services, traveled to the mine to review training records of the mine operator and contractor.\u00a0On January 15, 2019, formal interviews were conducted jointly by MSHA and KDMS at the MSHA District 7 Office in Barbourville, Kentucky.\u00a0 See Appendix B for a list of persons interviewed and those participating in the accident investigation.\u00a0", "DISCUSSION": "Mine Operator and Coal Owner RelationshipThe contract between the mine operator and the coal owner requires the mining height to be at or below 54 inches.\u00a0 To verify compliance, the survey crew periodically measures the mining height on the MMU.\u00a0 Measurements are taken at 20 foot intervals in the center of each entry.\u00a0 Slone was taking mining height measurements in the No. 3 entry when he was struck by the shuttle car.Accident LocationInvestigators believe the accident occurred at approximately 11:10 a.m., when Lane turned the No. 4 shuttle car into the No. 3 entry at the switch-out location.\u00a0 The No. 4 shuttle car is 28 feet long and Slone\u2019s map was found about 30 feet from the inby corner of the pillar (see Appendix C).\u00a0 This would indicate that Slone had already been struck when Barnett and Lane exited their cars to free the shuttle car cable.No. 4 Shuttle CarThe No. 4 10SC32 shuttle car, serial number ET16606, was manufactured by Joy Manufacturing Company.\u00a0 The last weekly electrical examination on the shuttle car was conducted on January 12, 2019, and the examination record stated that a cable was repaired.The shuttle car was inspected after the accident.\u00a0 The brakes functioned properly and no permissibility violations were found, but one of the two headlights was inoperable.\u00a0 This light was on the side that the victim was located at the time of the accident.\u00a0 Interviews did not reveal that anyone had knowledge that the light was out on the shuttle car.TrainingSlone had over 30 years of experience as an underground miner and surveyor.\u00a0 He had been certified in the state of Kentucky as an underground miner and underground mine foreman, and he was certified in gas detection.The mine operator provided hazard training to Slone.\u00a0 Slone worked several years as a surveyor in other mines owned by TENNCO INC, and these other mines used the same mining methods and equipment as the Toms Fork Mine.\u00a0", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.\u00a0Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions which were implemented to prevent a recurrence.\u00a0Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not have effective policies, procedures, and controls to protect miners who are on foot from being contacted by moving mobile face equipment.\u00a0 The shuttle car operator\u2019s field of vision was greatly reduced due to the size/height of the shuttle car and the low mining height.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 On January 17, 2019, the mine operator submitted, and MSHA approved, a revision to the roof control plan that contains the following safety measures to protect miners travelling on foot on the working section.All persons entering the mine will wear a permissible LED light on the back of their hard hat.\nSurvey crew members will notify the mine operator of the working section to which they will be travelling.\nThe mine operator will notify the miners on the working section.\nThe survey crew will only work on the opposite side of the section of the mining activity.\u00a0 If the survey crew is in the belt entry, all mining activities will cease.\nLong reflective markers will be hung in each crosscut from the feeder to the face to show where the survey crew is working.\nWhen the survey crew is finished they will notify the mine operator who will notify the miners on the working section.\n\nOn January 20, 2019, all miners were trained by the mine operator on the provisions of the revised roof control plan.\u00a0 Documentation of miners receiving the training was provided.The No. 4 shuttle car has been removed from service until a camera system is installed on the shuttle car.\u00a0 The camera system will enable the shuttle car operator to have greater visibility in the area where the victim was located.\u00a0 Camera systems were also installed on the other shuttle cars.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not ensure that both headlights on the shuttle car were working properly to illuminate the direction of travel and warn miners traveling on foot.\u00a0 One headlight on the dump end of the shuttle car involved in the fatal accident was not operational.\u00a0\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator repaired the headlight and implemented a new pre-operational examination policy.\u00a0 The new policy requires the lights on shuttle cars to be examined, and repaired if necessary, before operating each shift.", "CONCLUSION": "On Monday, January 14, 2019, at approximately 11:10 a.m., Jeffery N. Slone, a 56-year-old survey crew member with 30 years of mining experience, was fatally injured when he was struck by a shuttle car traveling to the coal feeder.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, Slone was taking measurements of the mining height as part of his surveying duties.The accident occurred because the mine operator did not have effective policies, procedures, and controls to protect miners who are on foot from being contacted by moving mobile face equipment.\u00a0Samuel R.

Ditterline, Contract Laborer, reported to work on the 3rd shift which began at 11:00 p.m. \u00a0Harvey Niehaus, Assistant Mine Manager, was traveling through the main shaft bottom area and heard a \u201cwhistling\u201d sound near the stopping in the No. 4 entry between footage markers 200 and 300. \u00a0Niehaus continued traveling to check on a belt and electrical power move, and then returned and found the stopping was bowing in the center and leaking across the top.\u00a0 Niehaus told Jim Payne, Supply Man, to remove the supply trailers from the crosscut and bring one pallet of concrete blocks to the damaged stopping location.Niehaus next traveled to the 4 Left head drive area and told Matthew Wright, Johnny Hettercheidt, and Jason Wilson, Contract Laborers, to travel to the bottom area and start working on building a stopping inby the damaged stopping. \u00a0Niehaus stopped at the West Main head drive where Ditterline and John Holland, General Laborer, were working. \u00a0He told them to travel to the bottom area and help the other miners build a new stopping. \u00a0Niehaus proceeded on to the 9 Left mining section.Holland and Ditterline arrived at the bottom area and met with Wright, Hettercheidt, and Wilson to build the stopping. \u00a0The area where they were building the new stopping had two 110 volt shop lights that needed to be removed. \u00a0To determine the location of the power cable that provided power to the lights, Ditterline traveled outby towards the pneumatic airlock doors located in the crosscut between entry 4 and entry 5 at footage markers 100 and 200 (see Appendix A). \u00a0He walked through the inby set of doors and closed them behind him, following the power cable for the lights. \u00a0Surveillance video shows that after Ditterline activated the outby set of pneumatic airlock doors, at 3:18 a.m., the indicator lights for the doors began flashing, which means the doors went into fault condition.\u00a0 There were no witnesses to what followed, but evidence indicated that Ditterline walked up to the doors, opened the slide access door and the airlock doors opened suddenly, hitting him and pinning him between one of the doors and the concrete barrier. \u00a0When the doors opened, Holland, Hettercheidt, Wright and Wilson could hear and feel the air velocity increase at the damaged stopping.Payne was working nearby and walked through the boot wash area to the shaft bottom. \u00a0Once at the hoist, Payne noticed the opened airlock doors and a leg extending through the slide access door.\u00a0 He ran toward the airlock doors and found Ditterline at 3:22 a.m., pinned behind the left airlock door.\u00a0 Ditterline was unresponsive.\u00a0 Payne immediately called on the radio for Holland to come to the shaft bottom. \u00a0Holland, Wright, Hettercheidt, and Wilson traveled to the shaft bottom to help.\u00a0 Holland tried to clear the fault condition at both sets of electronic sensors for the doors. \u00a0Once the doors started to close, Wilson and Hettercheidt pulled Ditterline out and laid him on his back.\u00a0 Ditterline was still unresponsive. \u00a0Wilson, who is an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), and Holland started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\u00a0 Hettercheidt assisted with CPR while Wright went to get an automated external defibrillator (AED) from the shop.Niehaus heard Payne call on the radio and traveled from the 9 Left mining section outby towards the bottom area. \u00a0Niehaus picked up Michael Welch, Contract Laborer/EMT and they proceeded to the accident scene.\u00a0 When Niehaus and Welch arrived, Wilson and Holland were still performing CPR. \u00a0An AED was applied to Ditterline, but the diagnostic function of the AED indicated that no shock be administered.\u00a0 They placed Ditterline on a backboard and carried him to the hoist for transport to the surface. \u00a0Upon arrival on the surface, Harre Ambulance service took over care of Ditterline and transported him to Hamilton Memorial Hospital.James Steven Bowling, Hamilton County Coroner, pronounced Ditterline dead at 4:45 a.m.\u00a0 Dr. James Jacoby, Forensic Pathologist, performed an autopsy and stated that Ditterline\u2019s death was due to a cardiomyopathy.\u00a0 Coroner Bowling listed cardiomyopathy as the cause of death on the State of Illinois Certificate of Death Worksheet.\u00a0 The worksheet also states that the manner of death was \u201cnatural.\u201dWhen a miner\u2019s death is not conclusively determined to be chargeable to the mining industry, MSHA submits the case, including facts and supporting information, to the MSHA Chargeability Review Committee (Review Committee) for a decision.\u00a0 The review committee has been in existence since 2008 and has reviewed over 500 cases.\u00a0 The Review Committee is currently comprised of the following persons:Reviewing Medical Official, Federal Occupational Health\nAssociate Solicitor for Mine Safety and Health\nDirector of the MSHA Office of Assessments\nDirector of the MSHA Office of Program Evaluation and Information Resources\nDirector of the MSHA Office of Educational Policy and Development (Chair)\nAfter a thorough review of the facts and medical information, the Review Committee found that, \u201cacute stress cardiomyopathy can occur when an individual is exposed to sudden, intense physical or emotional (grief, fear) stress which causes rapid and severe heart muscle weakness. \u00a0Acute stress cardiomyopathy can mimic a myocardial infarction (a heart attack) even in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cBecause 1) Mr. Ditterline was seen on video moments before the door accident in no apparent distress, 2) the door slam was a significantly traumatic event, and 3) the death occurred at the time of the door slam, the Review Committee members [concluded] it is probable that the trauma of the accident triggered acute stress cardiomyopathy.\u201d\u00a0 Therefore, the Review Committee stated, \u201cMr. Ditterline\u2019s death should be charged to the mining industry.\u201d", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On January 5, 2019, at 3:53 a.m., Gary Quertermous, Mine Control, notified the Department of Labor National Contact Center of the accident.\u00a0 At 4:08 a.m., the Contact Center notified Robert Bretzman, Supervisory Mine Safety and Health (CMS&H) Inspector.\u00a0 Bretzman notified Mary Jo Bishop, Assistant District Manager for Enforcement, of the accident.\u00a0 He then directed Brandon Naas, CMS&H Inspector/Accident Investigator, to investigate the accident.\u00a0 Bretzman and Naas traveled to the mine where they met Bishop. \u00a0Naas issued a 103(k) order to protect the safety of persons at the mine.Investigators obtained preliminary interview statements from persons having knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident.\u00a0 The accident investigation team then traveled underground and arrived at the accident scene at approximately 11:20 a.m.\u00a0 They took photographs and measurements of the accident scene.MSHA conducted the investigation in cooperation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Mines and Minerals (IDNR), and Hamilton County Coal, LLC personnel. \u00a0See Appendix B for a list of those participating in the investigation.On January 7, 2019, David Brown, Training Specialist with MSHA\u2019s Educational Field & Small Mine Services (EFSMS), reviewed training records. \u00a0Bretzman and Naas conducted further testing on the pneumatic airlock doors after the stopping had been replaced.On January 8, 2019, Gary Rethage and Mark Kvitkovich, Mechanical Engineers with MSHA Technical Support, traveled to the mine with other investigators to mechanically evaluate the pneumatic airlock doors involved in the accident.On January 17, 2019, the accident investigation team conducted interviews at the IDNR building located in Benton, Illinois (see Appendix B).", "DISCUSSION": "Accident SceneThe accident occurred at the set of outby pneumatic airlock doors located on the East Main, Entry 4, between footage markers 0-100, just east of the Main Shaft bottom area (see Appendix A).\u00a0 When investigators arrived, the pneumatic doors involved in the accident were in the open position and the slide access door was open.\u00a0 Electrical power had been disconnected, locked, and tagged out.Pneumatic Airlock DoorsThe airlock consisted of a set of pneumatic-operated equipment doors (an outby set and an inby set) that allow equipment and personnel access between the mine and the shaft. \u00a0The outby airlock doors involved in the accident are located near the bottom of the shaft. The inby set of doors are one crosscut inby through an angled crosscut (see Appendix A).\u00a0 The doors were manufactured by Alliance Central Shop.\u00a0 The doors are made of metal and each door is approximately 7 feet wide by 7.3 feet high and weighs approximately 550 pounds.\u00a0 Both doors opened in the inby direction.\u00a0 One door of each set has a small slide access door which measured 29\u201d X 18.5\u201d.Pneumatic Door OverviewThere are two pneumatic systems at this airlock, one for the inby airlock doors, and the other for the outby airlock doors.\u00a0 Each pneumatic system is comprised of a compressor, air tank (accumulator), two pneumatic hoses with flow restriction valves in-line, and a pneumatic cylinder. \u00a0The cylinder rod connects via a bolted connection to the slide mechanism. \u00a0The slide mechanism, which rolls on a steel beam mounted to the roof of the entry, connects to the linkage bars via a pinned connection. \u00a0The linkage bars then connect to the doors with a pinned connection (see Appendix C).\u00a0The pneumatic cylinder is a double acting cylinder; it has a port on both sides of the cylinder to control motion for extension or retraction. \u00a0When the doors are closed, the cylinder rod is in the extended position. \u00a0The pneumatic air pressure is located on the piston side of the cylinder to keep the cylinder rod extended and the doors closed, while the air in the other side vents to the atmosphere. \u00a0The air venting to atmosphere works as a dampener to slow the pressurized side. \u00a0This allows the doors to open or close in a controlled manner. \u00a0The solenoids reverse when the doors go into the open status, pressurizing the rod side of the cylinder to retract the cylinder rod and venting the air on the piston side of the cylinder rod.An electronic system controls the pneumatic components. \u00a0This system utilizes an Allen Bradley MicroLogix 1400 Model, programmable logic controller (PLC), which controls the solenoid valves, lights, and audible alarms. \u00a0There are limit switches above the slider mechanism that sense the position of the cylinder rod. \u00a0The limit switches send a signal to the logic controller. \u00a0An electronic signal opens a solenoid and closes the other solenoid when the beam of the photo sensors is broken. \u00a0This also triggers the lights and audible alarms for the direction of travel.\u00a0The photo sensor has two sides: \u00a0open or close. \u00a0The open sensor is marked with green and the close sensor is marked with red. \u00a0The beam generator generates a beam; the beam reflects back to a sensor in the beam generator. \u00a0When the beam is broken, the PLC opens or closes the doors. \u00a0The PLC also activates the lights and audible alarms. \u00a0Miners operate the doors by placing their hand into the appropriate side of the photo sensor mount located near the doors (see Appendix D).The doors have three statuses: \u00a0closed, open and fault. \u00a0The fault condition activates when the doors do not reach the limit switch in the desired direction of travel within 35 seconds. \u00a0The pneumatics stay pressurized in the desired direction of travel while the air in the other side of the cylinder has had time to completely vent to the atmosphere. \u00a0The fault clears by interrupting the beam on both the open and close sides of the photo sensor mount. \u00a0The lights continue to flash in the fault condition, but the alarm stops after 35 seconds.Mechanical Engineers from MSHA Technical Support observed the outby doors and its components on January 8, 2019. \u00a0They evaluated the components of the pneumatic system for damage. \u00a0The investigators did not observe damage on any component of the system, including the pneumatic cylinder, cylinder rod, linkages, hoses, valves, air tank (accumulator), or door. \u00a0The electronic controls appeared to be functioning properly as the door functioned as designed when tested.\u00a0 Investigators did not observe damaged components in the pneumatic system or mechanical components. \u00a0The pneumatic system and all mechanical components operated as designed.Effects of Ventilation Pressures on the Pneumatic DoorsThe mine repaired the damaged stopping prior to the January 8 investigation to correct the ventilation. \u00a0The investigators observed that the outby doors opened normally with the corrected ventilation. \u00a0However, the inby doors would not open without assistance due to the ventilation change caused by the damaged stopping. \u00a0When mine personnel pushed on the inby doors, they opened in an uncontrolled rapid manner in the same way the outby doors opened, which caused the fatal injury.ReenactmentIn an attempt to recreate a fault condition on the outby doors, the investigators opened the sliding door on one of the inby doors to increase pressure and ventilation in the airlock.\u00a0 The investigators measured the velocity of the air in the airlock with an anemometer. \u00a0The air quantity was approximately 13,000 cubic feet per minute (cfm). \u00a0Before repairs were made to the damaged stopping, the quantity of the air in the airlock had been measured at approximately 36,000 cfm. \u00a0Despite the reduced ventilation pressure, the outby doors went into the fault condition and did not open without assistance.The system was set to the fault condition again to evaluate what would happen when the sliding door in one of the outby doors was opened. \u00a0After a few seconds, the outby doors opened in an uncontrolled rapid manner. \u00a0This test demonstrated the scenario that evidence indicates occurred at the time of the accident.\u00a0Mine personnel placed pressure gauges on both ports of the outby door cylinder to monitor pressures while the door was being tested.\u00a0 The air tank maintained a pressure of 140 pounds per square inch (psi).\u00a0 Testing was then performed on the cylinder while the door was in a fault condition.\u00a0 The rod side of the cylinder remained within its designed operating pressures of 105 to 120 psi.\u00a0 The piston side of the cylinder went to zero which means that there was no dampening effect to allow the doors to open in a controlled manner after the slide access door was open.\u00a0 Testing showed investigators that the pneumatic system operated as designed, that there were no overpressures or other problems solely with the pneumatic system, and that the problem with the doors was created by the high air pressure environment.Conclusions from TestingThe increased ventilation pressure due to the damaged stopping was outside the designed operating parameters for this system. \u00a0At the time of the accident, the airlock door system operated within its designed logic parameters and entered a fault condition when the door would not open. \u00a0When the victim opened the sliding door on the outby door, the ventilation pressure moved toward equilibrium. \u00a0The pneumatic air pressure on the rod side of the cylinder (pushing open the door) was now greater than the force provided by the ventilation pressure (holding the door closed). \u00a0The residual air pressure on the piston side of the cylinder that normally dampens this movement had completely vented to the atmosphere; this allowed the outby door to open in an uncontrolled rapid manner.Rethage and Technical Support\u2019s Mechanical Engineering Division calculated the kinetic energy and the energy equivalency of the pneumatic airlock door when it impacted Ditterline.\u00a0 They determined that the door hit Ditterline with the equivalent energy of a 550 pound mass moving at approximately 4.5 miles per hour.\u00a0 Ditterline was pinned between the door and the concrete barrier, with the door continually applying a force of 550 pounds until the door was moved away from him and closed.\u00a0 Video surveillance established that the outby airlock doors went into fault mode at 3:18 a.m., and the door was removed from Ditterline at 3:22 a.m.Problems with the Pneumatic Airlock DoorsInvestigators discovered through interviews and discussions with miners that the operation of the airlock doors was problematic and known to miners.\u00a0 Investigators also learned through the discussions with miners that the mine operator attempted to overcome the high mine ventilation pressure by installing an air compressor near the shaft bottom, in line with the air supply from the surface, to ensure air was always available for the airlock doors.\u00a0 This did not correct the problem.\u00a0 After installing the compressor, the airlock doors would open easier. \u00a0However, the slide access door still had to be opened for the airlock doors to operate, and the airlock doors would open more violently.\u00a0 Investigators also discovered that on the shift prior to the accident, a miner was nearly struck by the same set of airlock doors as the victim.\u00a0 However, mine management was not made aware of this incident.Investigators reviewed the mine surveillance video from earlier in the shift prior to the accident.\u00a0 This video shows Payne, who normally works in this area of the mine and is very familiar with these airlock doors, open the inby set of airlock doors and drive his megatrack pushing a supply trailer into the airlock.\u00a0 After closing the inby set, the video shows he activated the photo sensor to open the outby airlock doors involved in the accident.\u00a0 Although Payne cannot be seen on the video inside the airlock, the lights on the travelway indicate the airlock doors went into fault condition twice and did not open.\u00a0 Payne can be seen walking back through the inby set of airlock doors and around to the shaft bottom side of the outby set of doors. \u00a0By approaching the outby set of airlock doors from this side, he could open them standing out of the swing path while avoiding the sudden movement.ExaminationsInvestigators determined through interviews that the mine operator did not regularly conduct pre-shift examinations for supply travelways between the airlock doors.\u00a0 An adequate preshift examination may have identified the operational issues associated with the doors.Training and ExperienceDitterline had 28 years of total underground mining experience, with 5 weeks and 5 days as a contract laborer for Madisonville Mining, LLC at Hamilton County Coal.\u00a0 He had mine manager and mine examiner certifications from the State of Illinois. \u00a0He received experienced miner training on November 26, 2018.\u00a0 He had not received task training with regard to the hazards associated with the pneumatic airlock doors in fault condition.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \u00a0The accident investigation team identified root causes that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions that were implemented to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\u00a0 The pneumatic airlock doors were not designed and maintained to operate safely in the high mine ventilation pressure area near the shaft bottom.\u00a0 A damaged permanent ventilation stopping, which isolated the area between the airlock doors from the intake air course, caused the high mine ventilation pressure on the outby airlock doors.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator replaced the pneumatic system with a hydraulic system on the airlock doors that is capable of safely operating the doors in the high mine ventilation pressure area near the shaft bottom.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator had not established safe work procedures when miners encountered fault conditions on the pneumatic airlock doors.\nCorrective Action: \u00a0The mine operator developed and implemented safe work procedures to be followed in the event of fault conditions on pneumatic and hydraulic airlock doors.\u00a0 All miners were trained in these work procedures.Root Cause: \u00a0The mine operator did not task train the victim with regard to the hazards associated with the pneumatic airlock doors in fault condition.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 Miners have received task training on the safe operating procedures for the hydraulic equipment doors. \u00a0Also, the hydraulic equipment door operation instructions have become part of the mine operator\u2019s Standardized Traffic Rules.", "CONCLUSION": "On Saturday, January 5, 2019, at approximately 3:20 a.m., John D. Ditterline, a 55 year-old contract laborer, died when he was pinned between a pneumatic airlock door and a concrete barrier.\u00a0 The victim was tracing a power cable through the area of the airlock doors and he had passed through an inby set of airlock doors.\u00a0 When he tried to open the outby set of airlock doors, they failed to open.\u00a0 Evidence indicates that he then opened a small sliding access door at the bottom of one of the outby airlock doors.\u00a0 The opening of the sliding door lowered the air pressure and caused the outby airlock doors to suddenly spring open, pinning the victim between one of the outby airlock doors and a concrete barrier.The accident occurred because the mine operator did not design and maintain the pneumatic airlock doors to operate safely in the high air pressure environment where they were located, and did not establish safe work procedures for when the doors did not operate properly.\u00a0 A damaged, permanent ventilation stopping, isolating the area between the airlock doors from the intake air course, created additional pressure causing the doors to not open properly.\u00a0Approved By:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Ronald W.

Brown began his shift on December 29, 2018, at approximately 6:00 p.m. Ronald Coleman, Night Shift Supervisor, conducted a safety meeting with the night shift workcrew: Brown; Gregory Raley, Plant Operator; Mathew Rumley, Plant Operator; and Steven Strasser, Plant Operator. \u00a0Employees rotated positions every three to four hours during the shift, in accordance with Coalview\u2019s procedures. \u00a0Brown operated the suction dredge, Raley went to the control room, and Rumley and Strasser were the groundsmen for the first rotation.\u00a0\u00a0At approximately 6:30 p.m., after the safety meeting, Brown drove out to the impoundment, referred to as pond 3C (see Appendix A), to begin operating the suction dredge and relieve William Bachman, Plant Operator. \u00a0Bachman stated in his interview that when Brown relieved him, he told Brown that the walking surface of the starboard side of the stern pontoon was around one inch below the water surface. \u00a0Bachman released some tension on the stern-line and brought the pontoon up about four inches above the water line. \u00a0Bachman then left the suction dredge, but returned when he discovered that he left his portable radio. \u00a0Brown handed Bachman the radio and Bachman left the suction dredge.Approximately 6:53 p.m., Raley radioed Brown to relay flow information, and Brown told Raley that he was going to see clear water, because he was going to pump out the pontoon.\u00a0 The investigators found a portable bilge pump in the starboard compartment of the stern pontoon. (See Appendix B) \u00a0Based on the location of the portable pump, the investigators concluded that Brown intended to pump the stern pontoon.At approximately 7:14 p.m., Raley noticed that the output from the suction dredge had dropped off. He attempted to radio Brown, but received no response. At that time, Rumley and Strasser were checking a light plant near the power box for the suction dredge, Rumley noticed that the power indicator lights were not on. Strasser radioed Raley alerting him that there was no power to the dredge and that he could not see the dredge. At this time, Rumley traveled by boat to check on the dredge.When Rumley reached the location of the dredge, he found it had sunk with only the A-frame protruding out of the water. Rumley radioed Coleman, who notified Brian Casperson, Trans Alta\u2019s Shift Supervisor, and asked him to call for help. Coleman and Strasser also joined in the search for Brown by boat.Casperson called for emergency responders at 7:54 p.m.\u00a0 The fire department, law enforcement and emergency medical services arrived and continued to search for Brown.\u00a0 At approximately 10:28 p.m., rescuers halted search efforts because of the weather and poor visibility.\u00a0 The search resumed during the daylight hours on December 30, 2018. \u00a0Law enforcement officers called rescue divers from Thurston County, Washington.\u00a0 The rescue divers located Brown, who was wearing a flotation device, at approximately 2:35 p.m. in the dredge operator\u2019s compartment.\u00a0 The interviews with the divers revealed that they had a difficult time opening the dredge operator\u2019s compartment door.\u00a0 They recovered the victim and turned him over to the Lewis County Coroner for an autopsy.\u00a0 The medical examiner determined that the cause of death was from drowning.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On December 29, 2018, at 7:50 p.m., Roger Fish, Coalview\u2019s President, contacted the Department of Labor\u2019s National Contact Center (DOLNCC), to notify MSHA that a miner was unaccounted for and possibly trapped in a suction dredge. \u00a0DOLNCC notified Melvin Palmer, MSHA\u2019s Kent Field Office Supervisory Inspector, of the accident at 8:05 p.m. Palmer dispatched John Uriona, MSHA Inspector, to the mine and the investigation started the next day. \u00a0Upon arrival, Uriona issued an order under the Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to secure the scene and ensure the safety of the miners.MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident site, interviewed miners, and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident.\u00a0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and contractors.\u00a0 See Appendix C for persons participating in the investigation.Coalview took over two months to contract Global Diving and Salvage Inc., a maritime salvage company to recover the suction dredge. \u00a0The recovery process began on March 4, 2019. \u00a0They recovered the suction dredge and brought it to a prepared examination area on April 11, 2019.\u00a0 The recovery was hampered by the dredge being stuck in the several feet of coal slurry.Johnathan Hall, MSHA\u2019s Approval and Certification Center Mechanical Engineer, arrived on April 16, 2019, to begin assessment of the condition of the suction dredge. \u00a0Jordan Rose and Robert Bates, MSHA\u2019s Pittsburgh Safety and Health Technology Center Electrical Engineers arrived on April 30, 2019, to assess the electrical distribution system.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred in a coal refuse impoundment identified as pond 3C.\u00a0 The maximum depth of the pond is approximately 30 feet and investigators estimate the depth where the dredge sank was 21 feet.\u00a0Suction DredgeInvestigators were unable to determine the manufacturer and the year of manufacture of the suction dredge.\u00a0 There was a weld bead on the starboard side of the center hull section with the letters and numbers WB133MIF0493.\u00a0 This was the only identification marking on the suction dredge, and investigators were not able to track it or find any information on the dredge searching various databases.Coalview purchased the suction dredge in 2015, from Dredge Central of Goodlettsville, Tennessee. \u00a0It is approximately 72 feet long and 17 feet wide. \u00a0It consists of four sections with flotation: the starboard pontoon; the port pontoon; the stern pontoon; and the center hull (See Appendices B and D).\u00a0 The starboard and port pontoons had four sealed compartments each.\u00a0 The stern pontoon had two sealed compartments.\u00a0 The center hull does not seal. \u00a0Other major components include the cutter head assembly, the A-frame that supports the cutter head, and the dredge operator\u2019s compartment.When Coalview purchased the suction dredge, it was equipped with a diesel engine.\u00a0 At Coalview\u2019s request, Dredge Central replaced the diesel engine with four electric motors.\u00a0 Dredge Central also added the stern pontoon, the electrical transformer on top of the stern pontoon, and the Motor Control Center (MCC) on top of the stern end of the center hull. \u00a0Water was added to the first compartment on the starboard side pontoon to counter-balance the electrical transformer that was added to the portside stern pontoon when the suction dredge was modified from a diesel suction dredge, to an electrical suction dredge.\u00a0Coalview runs a 7200 volt power cable from the shore to the electrical transformer to provide power to the suction dredge.Suction Dredge OperationThe suction dredge does not have conventional vessel controls or a propeller.\u00a0 Three winches control the suction dredge location by reeling in or spooling out cables attached to anchor points on the shore.\u00a0 The stern winch is located at approximately the center of the stern pontoon, in an elevated position, and next to the transformer.\u00a0 The front starboard and port winches are mounted at the front of the dredge operator\u2019s compartment.The suction dredge recovers coal slurry from the bottom of the impoundment.\u00a0 The slurry is a mixture of water, coal fines, rock, and clay or dirt. \u00a0The cutting head is lowered into the water from the A frame by a winch. \u00a0The weight of the cutter head assembly caused the suction dredge trim to change.\u00a0 As the cutter head assembly lifts up, the bow (forward part of the hull) of the suction dredge lowers in the water and as the cutter head assembly lowers, the bow of the suction dredge lifts up and the stern of the suction dredge lowers into the water.\u00a0 Based on statements made during investigation interviews, investigators learned that portions of the deck were underwater, at times, during normal operation.A large slurry pump, powered by a 500 horsepower electric motor, pulls the material loosened by the cutting head into the inlet pipe. \u00a0The slurry pump pushes the slurry into a discharge pipe on the suction dredge.Suction Dredge ConditionPontoons & Compartments:Investigators conducted tests for leaks on nine of the ten pontoon compartments. \u00a0Damage sustained to the port side of the stern pontoon during recovery of the suction dredge made it impossible to test the port side compartment on the stern pontoon.\u00a0 The rubber seals on the ten hatch covers for the pontoon compartments were hardened and flat along the outer edges, preventing the hatches from getting a positive seal. Prior to testing, investigators removed a mixture of mud, coal slurry, rust, and water from each compartment. \u00a0Investigators filled the nine undamaged pontoon compartments with water and documented any leaks.Investigators determined that the first and fourth compartments on the starboard pontoon leaked. \u00a0A pipe with a valve that did not fully close allowed water to flow between the third and fourth compartments. \u00a0Pontoons should be kept independent of each other in case if one pontoon fails the other pontoons would continue to float.The number four compartment of the starboard pontoon had an area of deterioration on its bottom outside weld seam that measured 31 inches long.\u00a0 Within that 31 inches of affected area, there were two, approximately 6.5 inches long cracks, and an approximately 0.5 inch hole located between the cracks. \u00a0The hatch that secured the starboard compartment on the stern pontoon was missing. \u00a0Brown appears to have been pumping water from the starboard compartment using a portable electric sump pump, as investigators found the pump with electrical cord and discharge hose here.\u00a0 Testing did not reveal any leaks in this compartment. \u00a0The other nine hatches were in place and secured.\u00a0Bilge Pumps:Two of the three built-in, float-equipped bilge pumps in the center hull were missing. \u00a0The port and starboard bilge pumps on the bow end of the hull had been removed. \u00a0The third portside aft bilge pump was not functional. \u00a0Appendix B shows the three pumps with labels PF (Pump Forward), PL (Pump Left), and PR (Pump Right).Investigators identified a hose that connected the sump pump in the stern end of the hull to its outlet pipe that discharges outside of the hull and into the pond. \u00a0This pipe penetrated the stern end of the center hull 43 inches above the bottom. \u00a0Neither the pipe, the hose, nor the pump included a check valve.Equipment Changes:Coalview replaced the slurry pump that came with the suction dredge with a larger, heavier model. \u00a0This larger pump required reinforcement of the floor of the center hull to support it. \u00a0Coalview also replaced electric motors on the suction dredge multiple times after the hull had taken on enough water to submerge and destroy them.\u00a0 These changes added thousands of pounds of additional weight to the suction dredge. \u00a0Dredge Operator\u2019s Compartment Doors:The dredge operator\u2019s compartment had a metal door with windows on the starboard and port side. \u00a0The starboard door did not line up properly with the doorframe and the plunger of the doorknob did not engage the doorframe. \u00a0Opening and closing the starboard door required significant force. \u00a0On many occasions during the investigation, investigators had to make multiple attempts to open the starboard door to the dredge operator\u2019s compartment.\u00a0 The port side door lined up with the doorframe and the plunger of the knob engaged with the doorframe. \u00a0However, the plunger was badly worn and came apart during the investigation, and mine personnel reported that both doors routinely stuck closed.\u00a0 Coalview reportedly replaced the entire doorknob assembly about once a year. \u00a0There was a new replacement assembly on the floor of the dredge operator\u2019s compartment, unopened in the original packaging.Electrical:Based on the information gathered during the investigation and the data recorded by Trans Alta, an electrical fault occurred in the 7200 volt dredge circuit at 7:19 p.m. on the day of the accident. The fault was of sufficient magnitude and duration to cause the oil blast circuit breaker in Substation 6 to trip. \u00a0Vacuum circuit breaker 14, which is located in the switch house near the shore of the settling pond, did not trip during the event because the shunt trip mechanism had been disassembled.MSHA Mine Electrical Systems Division examined three short segments of Anaconda Brand 1/0 AWG, 8 KV, portable cable that supplied power to the dredge.\u00a0 Their examination found the outer jacket of these segments was damaged, and this damage had allowed water to enter into the interior of the cable.\u00a0 The damage extended into the insulation of one of the phases, but did not penetrate all the way to the copper conductor.\u00a0Daily InspectionsThe hazardous conditions that were found on the dredge, after it was recovered, were obvious and widespread.\u00a0 Also, management was aware of many of these conditions found on the dredge and continued to operate the dredge by using bilge pumps to remove water from the pontoons and hull. \u00a0Investigators discovered an electronic file that contained hazardous conditions observed during the mine operator\u2019s daily inspections.\u00a0 However, many of these hazardous conditions were not recorded in the preshift/on-shift daily report record book.WeatherThe weather conditions near the time of the accident were rainy and windy, with a temperature in the mid 40\u2019s. \u00a0The suction dredge operators from prior shifts reported \u201cbrown caps\u201d, or large waves in the pond.\u00a0Training and ExperienceCaleb J. Brown had 21 weeks of experience as a plant operator, all of which were at this mine. \u00a0On March 20, 2019, Heather Smith, MSHA\u2019s Educational Field and Small Mine Services Training Specialist, traveled to the mine and conducted an in-depth review of the mine operator's training records.\u00a0 The training records for Mr. Brown were in compliance with 30 CFR.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "The accident investigation team conducted a root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the accident.\u00a0 The team identified the following root causes and corresponding corrective actions implemented to prevent a recurrence of the accident.Root Cause: Mine management allowed several unsafe conditions to exist on the dredge.\u00a0 There were leaks in several compartments of the starboard pontoon. \u00a0Efforts to correct the leaks were unsuccessful, forcing miners to pump the pontoons and hull on a regular basis. \u00a0The combination of the water already in the starboard pontoon and hull, water entering through the open stern hatch and the stormy weather caused the dredge to sink.Corrective Action: The dredge has been taken out of service and is being evaluated for salvage / scrap value. The operator has submitted a new operating plan, which must be approved by the District Manager before any mining activities can resume.\u00a0Root Cause:\u00a0 Mine management did not correct hazards found during examinations.Corrective Action: The dredge has been taken out of service and is being evaluated for salvage / scrap value. The operator has submitted a new operating plan, which must be approved by the District Manager before any mining activities can resume.", "CONCLUSION": "Caleb J. Brown drowned after the suction dredge he was operating sank in an impoundment pond.\u00a0 The accident occurred because: the mine contractor did not have sufficient policies or procedures to maintain the suction dredge\u2019s pontoons, bilge pumps, and dredge operator\u2019s compartment doors to safely conduct mining operations; and the mine contractor conducted inadequate on shift examinations and took no action to correct hazardous conditions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Approved: ____________________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Date: _________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Donald R.

The MBC operated by Hostetter (victim) was outby the corner of the intersection in the No. 3 entry, between the conveyor belt and the left coal rib.\u00a0 Hostetter was located on the outby corner of the intersection in the No. 3 entry (see Appendix A).When Laue finished positioning the CMM cable, Lane used his cap light to signal to Hostetter that it was time to move again.\u00a0 Lane began to tram the MBC forward but heard a loud metallic noise and was unable to continue forward.\u00a0 Lane yelled for Hostetter and shut off his machine. \u00a0He yelled again and received no response.\u00a0 Lane could not see Hostetter, so he crawled back and saw him pinned between the No. 1 bridge conveyor frame and the coal rib.\u00a0 Lane trammed the No. 2 MBC back, and Hostetter fell to the mine floor.\u00a0 Lane pushed the panic button on the remote control transmitter to de-energize both MBCs, and yelled for Laue and Brian Francisco, Section Foreman and Emergency Medical Technician (EMT).Laue came from the CMM to the accident scene.\u00a0 Francisco was putting mining sights up in the No. 3 entry with Mike Scherer, Scoop Operator, when they both heard yelling and went to the accident scene.\u00a0 Other miners also heard yelling and went to the accident scene.\u00a0 Francisco assessed Hostetter\u2019s vitals and found no pulse or breathing.\u00a0 Francisco told the miners at the scene to call outside and tell Ernie Shaulis, Outside Attendant, to call 911 and then bring the first aid supplies and personnel carrier to the scene.\u00a0 Both Francisco and Scherer called Andrew Pianetti, Mine Examiner and EMT, who was working outby the section and told him to come to the section.Shaulis called 911 at 3:03 a.m. and then called Vincent Pelesky, Safety Supervisor, and Bradley Russian, Pennsylvania Bureau of Mine Safety (PA BMS) Inspector.\u00a0 Shaulis was contacted again from the miners underground and told to call for a helicopter.\u00a0 He called for a helicopter and then met the ambulance to show them where to land the helicopter.Hostetter was placed on the personnel carrier, which Laue drove to the surface while Pianetti and Scherer attempted to provide care to Hostetter.\u00a0 Pianetti and Scherer did not detect vital signs and were unable to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation because of the trauma sustained by the victim.\u00a0 When they arrived on the surface, both the Boswell Volunteer Fire Department and the Somerset ambulance services were waiting for them in the pit.\u00a0 The attendants from the ambulance service made the decision not to treat the victim any further.\u00a0 He was placed into an ambulance and transported to the helicopter landing area, where he was pronounced dead at 3:33 a.m. by Wallace Miller, Somerset County Coroner, via telephone.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On December 20, 2018, at 3:48 a.m., Vincent Pelesky, Safety Supervisor for the North Fork mine, notified the Department of Labor National Contact Center (DOL-NCC) of the accident.\u00a0 The DOL-NCC notified Randall Caramellino, MSHA District 2 Staff Assistant, at 4:01 a.m.\u00a0 Caramellino contacted Dennis Zeanchock, MSHA Johnstown Field Office Supervisor, at approximately 4:17 a.m.\u00a0 Zeanchock directed Gregory Bodenschatz, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector (CMI), and Richard Gindlesperger, CMI/Accident Investigator, to begin the accident investigation.\u00a0 Bodenschatz arrived at the mine at 5:20 a.m. and issued a 103(k) order to preserve the accident scene, prevent the destruction of evidence, and ensure the safety of all persons in the mine.MSHA personnel conducted the accident investigation in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mine Safety (PA BMS) and mine management.\u00a0 The investigation team conducted interviews with miners.\u00a0 See Appendix B for a list of persons interviewed and those participating in the accident investigation.The investigation team traveled underground and took pictures and measurements of the accident scene.\u00a0 The MBC system safety controls were tested on both MBCs and the remote control transmitters.\u00a0 During these preliminary tests investigators found no deficiencies.On December 21, 2018, Gindlesperger, Bodenschatz, along with representatives of PA BMS, and members of mine management traveled underground to conduct further testing of the safety functions on the MBCs and remote control transmitters.\u00a0 They conducted a re-creation of the accident and collected additional photos and measurements.\u00a0 The MBCs and the remote control transmitters functioned as designed during this testing.On December 26, 2018, Gindlesperger, Bodenschatz, Mark Gindlesperger, Deep Mine Inspector Supervisor, PA BMS, and members of mine management traveled underground to conduct function tests on the No. 1 MBC.\u00a0 The remote control transmitters for the No. 1 and No. 2 MBCs were taken into custody by MSHA for additional testing.On January 25, 2019, Structured Mining Systems Inc., (dba Cervis Inc.) performed functionality testing on the remote control transmitters at the Cervis facility in Cranberry, Pa.\u00a0 Both remote control transmitters functioned as designed.\u00a0 Investigators determined that both transmitters had several discrepancies when they were compared to the approval documentation on file at the MSHA Approval and Certification Center.\u00a0 The discrepancies did not contribute to the fatal accident.\u00a0 MSHA issued two non-contributory citations to Cervis Inc., one for each transmitter.", "DISCUSSION": "Accident SceneThe accident occurred 5 feet inby station spad 8487, in the No. 3 entry intersection of the 5 Right Room D section.\u00a0 The victim was on the right outby corner of the intersection in the No. 3 entry and the No. 1 MBC was outby the corner of the intersection in the No. 3 entry, between the conveyor belt and the left coal rib (see Appendix A).\u00a0 The area was

dry.\u00a0When the investigators arrived on the scene, the equipment was in the location that miners described during interviews. \u00a0Imprints of the MBC tracks, found on mine floor, were undisturbed and used to determine the location of the equipment at the time of the accident.Continuous Haulage Mining SystemThe continuous haulage mining system involved in the accident was a \u201cdetached system,\u201d meaning that the MBCs and bridge conveyors were not physically attached to the CMM.\u00a0 In addition, the MBCs did not have operator compartments and were remotely controlled.\u00a0 The continuous haulage system was a Fairchild[1], Model - Hi-Cap XL, Serial Number (SN) MBC 13-182, MSHA approval number 2G-3326A-7.\u00a0 The No. 2 (inby) MBC collects the mined coal from the rear of the CMM.\u00a0 A bridge conveyor connects the No. 2 MBC to the No. 1 (outby) MBC and another bridge conveyor connects the No. 1 MBC to the section conveyor belt (see Appendix A).The MBCs are operated separately by each MBC operator with a remote control transmitter from any location within radio frequency range, which can exceed 100 feet.\u00a0 The remote control transmitters used to control the MBCs were Structured Mining Systems Inc., remote control Model Number TX-H107. \u00a0Remote control transmitter SN 124 was used to operate the No. 1 MBC and remote control transmitter SN 129 was used to operate the No. 2 MBC.Each remote control transmitter has an \u201cinactivity shutdown\u201d function that shuts down the transmitter and the MBC if no switch on the transmitter is actuated within a set time.\u00a0 After the accident, the inactivity shutdown time was changed from 1 hour (set by the manufacturer) to 1 minute.CommunicationInvestigators learned that Lane commonly signaled with his cap lamp to inform Hostetter of his intentions to move forward or backward.\u00a0 This method of communication is unreliable because the view may be blocked and there is no confirmation that the MBC operator received or understood the signal.\u00a0 A positive means of verbal communication by radio or pager helps prevent miscommunication.Training and ExperienceHostetter had a total of 5 years, 21 weeks, and 4 days of underground mining experience, with 4 years and 26 weeks of experience as a MBC operator. \u00a0All of his experience was at the North Fork mine. \u00a0Hostetter had a certificate of qualification as a miner and a machine operator\u2019s certificate from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.On July 22, 2013, and on August 9, 2013, Hostetter was trained in the task of a continuous haulage operator on a Caterpillar (CAT) MBC.\u00a0 This training was conducted prior to the arrival of the Fairchild MBCs in January of 2014.\u00a0 Training records show that he did not receive additional training after the new system arrived.The new system differed from the CAT MBC being used earlier in that it has no attached operator\u2019s compartment or machine mounted controls, is not attached to the CMM, and is operated by remote control.\u00a0 Given the differences between the two MBC systems, the mine operator should have revised the training plan to address the differences, including any potential differences in hazards.\u00a0 Such a revision should have emphasized red zones and safe locations for the operators.Hostetter operated the Fairchild MBC for approximately 5 years before the accident and miners who were interviewed stated that he was proficient. \u00a0Hostetter also performed task training for other Fairchild MBC operators.\u00a0 Therefore, investigators do not believe inadequate task training was a contributing factor to the fatal accident.\u00a0 However, MSHA issued a noncontributing citation for a violation of 48.7(a)(3) because the victim was not tasked trained before he started operating the Fairchild MBC in 2014.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that are correctible through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective action which was implemented to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\u00a0 The operator did not provide adequate means of protection against crushing injuries to miners that operate the Fairchild MBC system.\n\u00a0Corrective Action:A proximity detection system is being installed on the MBC involved in the fatal accident.\u00a0 The other MBCs will be provided with either a proximity detection system or a substantially constructed deck.\n\t\u00a0\nAll decks on MBCs shall be substantially constructed to protect MBC operators from crushing injuries.\u00a0 All decks shall be provided with an operator-in-position safety device.\u00a0 This device will be installed to deactivate the tram motors of all MBCs when an MBC operator exits the compartment.\u00a0 The switch shall prevent restarting the motor of any MBC until the operator returns in position.\u00a0 This safety device shall be functional when repositioning during the mining cycle or tramming the MBC from one place to another.\n\t\u00a0\nThe mine operator will perform and document a pre-operational check which includes checking each operator-in-position switch (if an operator\u2019s deck is installed), panic bar, and proximity detection system (if operated by remote control) prior to putting the equipment into service each shift.\u00a0 All deficiencies found that affect safety must be corrected before any MBC is put into service.\u00a0 The pre-operational checks, deficiencies found, and corrective actions shall be documented in the foreman\u2019s note pad and made available to MSHA upon request and recorded in a book.\u00a0 The record book of the pre-operational checks shall be promptly dated and signed.\u00a0 The record book will be retained at a surface location at the mine for at least one year and shall be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners.\n\t\u00a0\nAll MBCs shall be provided with an audible alarm system that warns machine operators and other miners in the vicinity at least 3 seconds in advance that the machines are energized and able to move.\u00a0 Cap lamp signals will not be an acceptable means of warning.\n\t\u00a0\nThe inactivity shutdown feature on the remote control of each MBC will be reduced to a maximum of one minute.\u00a0 No miner shall operate more than one remote control box at the same time.\n\t\u00a0\nAll MBC operators have been provided with a stand-alone permissible two-way voice communications system.\u00a0 Such communication system shall be either hardwired on the machine or a wireless device worn by the machine operators.\u00a0 If a wireless device is used, a separate radio frequency specified for such use only shall be provided.\u00a0 MBC operators must receive a verbal confirmation from all other MBC operators prior to tramming.\n\t\u00a0\nSpecific Fairchild MBC operator training was added to the approved training plan.\u00a0 All Fairchild MBC operators have been trained accordingly.\n", "CONCLUSION": "On December 20, 2018, at approximately 3:00 a.m., Nevin Hostetter, a 35-year-old mobile bridge carrier operator with 5 years and 21 weeks of mining experience, was fatally injured when he was crushed between a bridge conveyor and a solid coal rib.\u00a0 The accident occurred when the mobile bridge system was being trammed toward a continuous mining machine (CMM).\u00a0 The accident occurred because the

arrived at about 4:00 p.m.Plumley and Boylen arrived at the mine at approximately 4:00 p.m., and Westery arrived at roughly 5:00 p.m.\u00a0 Plumley, Boylen, and Westery traveled to the accident site and were briefed by Harbin.\u00a0 Harbin, Boylen, and Herren remained at the accident site to monitor the recovery operations.\u00a0 Plumley, Westery, and West went to the mine office and conducted informal interviews with miners who might have information relevant to the accident.On December 12, 2018, Plumley, Westery, Brock, and West along with company officials and engineers continued the investigation.\u00a0 Engineers used a drone to map and evaluate the post-accident geological features of the entire length of the highwall.On December 13, 2018, formal interviews were conducted at the MSHA Birmingham Field Office in conjunction with ADOL.\u00a0 See Appendix A for a list of those who were interviewed.\u00a0 James Pfeifer, Senior Civil Engineer, and Rodi Murad, Civil Engineer, both with MSHA\u2019s Technical Support Mine Waste and Geotechnical Engineering Division (MWGED), arrived at the mine to continue the onsite investigation.", "DISCUSSION": "Mining ProcessThe typical mining sequence consists of removing spoil material from the rock strata, drilling into the rock strata, and blasting the overburden to a depth of approximately 4 feet above the coal seam.\u00a0 This leaves a highwall ranging in height from 63 to 80 feet.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, the highwall was approximately 3,000 linear feet long.\u00a0 In August 2018, the mine operator began the mining operations that created this highwall. \u00a0\u00a0General Machine InformationThe front-end loader involved in the accident had 4 forward gears and 4 reverse gears, with a maximum forward speed of 23 miles per hour (mph) and 26 mph in reverse.\u00a0 The loader had an operating weight of 54,963 pounds including the bucket.\u00a0 It was approximately 30 feet long and 12 feet wide.\u00a0 Although the loader frame was damaged by the highwall collapse, its engine was still operating when the machine was recovered from the rock.Accident LocationThe accident occurred near the base of the highwall on the northwestern area of the property.\u00a0 The entire highwall was oriented in a northeast direction.\u00a0 The area that failed was approximately 400 feet south of the northern end of the highwall.\u00a0 The face of the highwall was sloped away from the pit approximately 20 degrees at most locations; however, there was at least one location south of the failure area where the upper portion of the highwall was sloped toward the pit.\u00a0 There were no benches in the highwall.There was a geologic fault in the rock in the vicinity of the wall failure. \u00a0The coal bed was 12 inches thinner on the left side of the failure. \u00a0During the interview process, miners stated the fault had consistently existed in approximately the same location in previous pits. \u00a0This anomaly provides an indicator of deformities that extended to the highwall.\u00a0Accident Site GeologyThe strata above the coal seam generally consisted of 65 feet of shale and sandstone covered by about 20 feet of silty clay soil.\u00a0 At the accident area, most of the silty clay soil overlying the rock had been removed before the highwall collapse.The failed portion of the highwall was triangular in shape, approximately 120 feet wide along the face of the highwall, and extended into the highwall approximately 40 feet.\u00a0 Based on the dimensions of the failed area, investigators estimate that approximately 7,000 to 8,000 cubic yards of material failed.\u00a0 The pile of debris from the failure extended up to the top of the highwall and out from the base of the highwall approximately 100 feet.Multiple discontinuities (rock joints) were observed in the exposed face of the highwall adjacent to the area that failed (see Appendix B).\u00a0 The bearing of one set of rock joints was N64\u00b0E.\u00a0 This is 48\u00b0 off of the bearing of the highwall (N16\u00b0E).\u00a0 This joint set defined one leg of the triangular-shaped failure.\u00a0 The length of the failure area along this set of joints was approximately 90 feet.\u00a0 The spacing of this set of exposed highwall joints, immediately behind the area that failed, ranged from approximately 2 feet to 4.5 feet.\u00a0 The joints, and slabs of rock between the joints, were dipping 84.4\u00b0 NW such that the rock was leaning toward the pit.\u00a0 Joint openings were up to 3 inches and staining of the exposed faces of the intact rock was present.Investigators observed a second set of rock joints, with a bearing roughly perpendicular to the first set of joints (N37\u00b0W).\u00a0 This joint set defined the second leg of the failure triangle.\u00a0 The length of the failure area along this set of joints was approximately 60 feet.\u00a0 The dip of this set of rock joints was approximately 70\u00b0 NE such that the rock was leaning away from the pit (see Appendix C).Investigators observed conditions of the area above the highwall.\u00a0 The vegetation within approximately 150 feet of the crest had been removed and silty clay soils overlying the rock were evident.\u00a0 The soil was sloped down toward the crest of the highwall.\u00a0 Most of the soil in the vicinity of the failure had been removed by pushing it over the highwall.\u00a0 Less soil had been removed from the highwall in the area directly north and south of the failure.\u00a0 The area to the north of the failure had been drilled and loaded for blasting just prior to the failure.Several tension cracks were present in the remaining soil at the top of the highwall in the failure area.\u00a0 The tension cracks in the soil were roughly parallel to the highwall failure face and were up to approximately 2 inches wide.\u00a0 The tension crack nearest the crest of the highwall had clean edges and did not appear to be filled with soil.\u00a0 The tension cracks further from the top of the highwall appeared to be partially filled with soil.Factors in the highwall failure were the location and orientation of the joint sets in the rock mass relative to the orientation of the highwall along with possible weather-related factors discussed below.\u00a0 The rock joints and rock slabs with a bearing of N64\u00b0E were leaning slightly toward the pit.\u00a0 The rock joints with a bearing of N37\u00b0W provided a release (break) for the rock mass that was leaning toward the pit.\u00a0 The staining on the face of the remaining rock indicated that the openings were preexisting and not due to blast fracturing (see Appendix D).Ground Control PlanThe mine operator\u2019s GCP was acknowledged on October 2, 2015.\u00a0 It detailed the plan to be used to assure that highwalls were safely created and provided provisions to follow when hazardous conditions were found.\u00a0 The following provisions are specifically stated in the mine operator's GCP but were not being followed:Benches and Highwalls (page 3) - Minimum Bench Width: 100 feet; Maximum Spacing To and/or between Benches: 50 feet.\n\t\u00a0\nGeneral Precautions (page 5, item 6) - Eliminating hazards from isolated individual rocks falling from a highwall will be accomplished through a combination of four (4) techniques: supporting or controlling the fall path of potentially loose rock, scaling the loose rock, providing rock catching benches or berms or both, and limiting the exposure of workers to areas where loose rock is present on the highwall.\n\t\u00a0\nGeneral Precautions (page 5, item 7) - If stress cracks exist or stability failure occurs in any portion of the highwall, operations in the affected area will be immediately revised.\u00a0 The revision will identify the reason for changes to the plan and will alert MSHA of the conditions resulting in the changes.\n\t\u00a0\nGeneral Precautions (page 6, item 12) - When failure to control the developing highwall occurs, such as the existence of overhangs, loose material, unconsolidated rocks, material falling into the pit, movement in the wall, or blasting practices fail to result in a clean and stable highwall, and corrective action cannot be taken to eliminate the existence of these conditions, the affected area will be barricaded to prevent persons from being exposed to the conditions and the plan will be revised to safely control the highwall and provide for safe conditions.\nInterview testimony indicated that management witnessed hazardous highwall conditions, such as stress cracks and poor stability, in the same general area of the accident in the previously developed highwall.\u00a0 The unsafe conditions served as a warning to management that the same or similar conditions may occur in future highwalls.\u00a0 The previously observed hazardous highwall conditions did occur in the highwall involved in the accident, but management did not utilize appropriate safety measures to abate these hazards or barricade areas off to prevent miners\u2019 exposure.\u00a0 These safety methods are clearly spelled out in the mine\u2019s GCP, and were not used.Weather ConditionsWeather can be a factor in highwall stability and may have been a factor in the failure of this highwall.Water was not observed seeping from the highwall in the area of the failure, however, two days before the accident about 3-inches of rain fell within a 24 hour timeframe.\u00a0 With numerous rock joints in the highwall, it is probable that some of the joints filled with water.\u00a0 On the day before the accident, the temperature was below freezing for about 10 hours.\u00a0 Freezing temperatures may have caused the water that may have been present in the rock joints to freeze and expand.\u00a0 The expanding water in the rock joints would have increased the horizontal forces on the slabs of rock between the rock joints, pushing the rock mass towards the pit.\u00a0 On the day and at the time of the accident, the temperature was 47\u00b0F with no rain.As required by 30 CFR \u00a7 77.1004(a), highwalls, banks, benches, and terrain sloping into the working areas shall be examined after every rain, freeze, or thaw before miners work in such areas.\u00a0 These examinations are to be made and recorded in accordance with 30 CFR \u00a7 77.1713.\u00a0Daily InspectionsThe daily inspection record for December 11, 2018, was made after the failure and noted that the highwall had fallen.\u00a0 Records of the daily inspections conducted for eight day shifts before the accident indicated that the highwall was \u201cok at this time.\u201d\u00a0 The eight previous daily inspections conducted for the second shifts indicated the highwall was \u201cstable.\u201dThere were multiple noticeable discontinuities (rock joints) observed in the exposed face of the highwall adjacent to the area that failed and tension cracks in the soil roughly parallel to the highwall (see Appendix B).\u00a0 Along its entire 3,000 linear feet of highwall, the highwall was greater than 50 feet high and no safety benches were constructed.\u00a0 The GCP required a minimum 100-foot-wide bench be constructed for every 50 feet in highwall height.\u00a0 For over three months, the mine operator developed the highwall in a manner that violated the provisions of the GCP.The hazardous conditions in the highwall, and the violations of the GCP, were obvious and widespread. \u00a0The daily inspections performed by the mine operator were inadequate.Training and ExperienceOn December 17, 2018, Brett Calzaretta, MSHA Educational Field and Small Mine Services (EFSMS) Training Specialist, and Westery checked company training records at the mine office.Cook had 14 years of experience working at this mine.\u00a0 On March 3, 2018, Cook received annual refresher training and experienced miner training, which included hazard training for this mine and other mine sites.\u00a0 Task training was conducted on July 18, 2017 at this mine site for operation of the Caterpillar 972G front-end loader.\u00a0 The training records were completed in accordance with the requirements of 30 CFR Part 48.In the interview process of the investigation, it became obvious to investigators that the foremen, the safety director, and the interviewed miners were not knowledgeable of key provisions of the GCP.\u00a0 Consequently, training as required by the mine\u2019s approved Training Plan was found to be ineffective and/or inadequate.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions which were implemented to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not conduct adequate daily inspections of the mine in that it did not recognize hazardous highwall conditions.\u00a0 Failure to identify and correct the hazardous highwall conditions allowed miners to be assigned to work in close proximity to the hazardous highwall.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 All mine foremen were trained on February 11, 2019, regarding proper daily inspections and hazard recognition pertaining to surface mining.\u00a0 The mine operator provided documentation of the training and the attendees.\u00a0 MSHA monitored the training.\u00a0Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not follow several provisions of the mine\u2019s GCP.\u00a0 The mine operator did not ensure that the miners were knowledgeable in the provisions of the mine\u2019s GCP.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator submitted a revised GCP which was reviewed and acknowledged by the District on January 23, 2019.\u00a0 The revision enhances safety by requiring, at all times, a 60-foot distance between the highwall and mobile equipment operators.\u00a0 Blasting will remove 180 feet from the pit and mobile equipment operators will only excavate 120 feet of blasted material, leaving a 60-foot buffer between them and the highwall.\u00a0 The mine operator trained all employees on the mine\u2019s GCP on January 28, 2019, and provided documentation of the training and the attendees.", "CONCLUSION": "On Tuesday, December 11, 2018, at approximately 2:07 p.m., Micky Cook, a 38-year-old surface miner with 14 years of mining experience was fatally injured when a large portion of a highwall (approximately 7,000 to 8,000 cubic yards) toppled.\u00a0 This caused rock to crush the operator\u2019s cab of the front-end loader he was operating.\u00a0 Cook was operating the front-end loader to remove blasted material near the base of a 63-foot highwall.The accident occurred because the mine operator did not conduct adequate daily examinations to identify hazardous highwall conditions and correct such hazards before allowing miners to work near the base of the highwall.\u00a0 Additionally, the mine operator did not follow safety provisions of the mine\u2019s Ground Control Plan (GCP).\u00a0 If implemented, these GCP requirements would have caused several safety measures to be initiated to eliminate hazardous highwall conditions.\u00a0 In addition, the mine operator did not adequately train miners regarding the safety provisions of the mine\u2019s GCP.\u00a0______________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

DateDistrict Manager", "\u00a0": "", "ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS": "Order No. 9132943 was issued to Cedar Lake Mining, Inc. on December 11, 2018, under the provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act:On December 11, 2018 at approximately 13:55, a fatal accident occurred from a fall of the highwall in the east end of the pit.\u00a0 The victim was operating a model 972G Caterpillar front end loader, serial no. 4WW00619, in the pit pushing up rock to be loaded out of the pit.\u00a0 A part of the highwall collapsed crushing the cab of the front end loader where the victim was located.\u00a0 This order is hereby issued to ensure the safety and health of the miners including those involved in rescue and recovery operations or investigation of the accident.\u00a0 The mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an Authorized Representative of the Secretary for all actions to recover and/restore operations in the affected area.\u00a0 Additionally, the mine operator is reminded of its existing obligations to prevent the destruction of evidence that would aid in investigation the cause of the accident.104(d)(1) Citation No. 9132944 was issued to Cedar Lake Mining, Inc. for violation of 30 CFR \u00a777.1000:On December 11, 2018, a Caterpillar 972G (Serial Number 4WW00619) front-end loader was operating near the base of a 63-foot high highwall to remove blasted material.\u00a0 A large portion of the highwall (approximately 7,000 \u2013 8,000 cubic yards of material) toppled onto the front-end loader, crushing the operator\u2019s cab and fatally injuring the miner.\u00a0 As a result of the fatal accident investigation, it is concluded that the mine operator did not comply with the provisions of the Ground Control Plan (GCP), acknowledged October 2, 2015 in the following manner:The surface mine highwall ranged in height from 63 to 80 feet over a linear distance of approximately 3,000 feet with no safety bench installed.\u00a0 The highwall at the site of the accident was 63 feet in height with no safety bench in place.\u00a0 Page 3 of the GCP requires a minimum 100 feet wide safety bench to be maintained at a maximum spacing to and/or between benches of 50 feet.\u00a0 The highwall at the site of the accident was 63 feet in height with no safety bench in place.\n\t\u00a0\nThe top of the surface mine highwall had loose, unconsolidated rock and material in numerous and extensive locations over a linear distance of approximately 3,000 feet with no adequate corrective measures implemented to eliminate the hazard. \u00a0Page 3, Item 6 of the GCP specifies that eliminating hazards from isolated individual rocks falling from a highwall will be accomplished through a combination of four (4) techniques: supporting or controlling the fall path of potentially loose rock, scaling the loose rock, providing rock catching benches or berms or both, and limiting the exposure of workers to areas where loose rock is present on the highwall.\n\t\u00a0\nEffective measures were not taken to eliminate the hazards of stress cracks which had developed in the highwall at the immediate location of the accident and in multiple locations along the linear distance of 3,000 feet of highwall. \u00a0Page 5, item 7 of the GCP specifies that if stress cracks exist or stability failure occurs in any portion of the highwall, operations in the affected area will be immediately stopped, the affected area will be barricaded and the GCP will be immediately revised.\u00a0 The revision will identify the reason for changes to the plan and will alert MSHA of the conditions resulting in the changes.\n\t\u00a0\nEffective measures were not taken to control, correct or barricade adverse areas of the highwall at the immediate location of the accident. \u00a0Page 6, item 12 of the GCP requires that when failure to control the developing highwall occurs, such as the existence of overhangs, loose material, unconsolidated rocks, material falling into the pit, movement in the wall, or blasting practices fail to result in a clean and stable highwall, and corrective action cannot be taken to eliminate the existence of these conditions, the affected area will be barricaded to prevent persons from being exposed to the conditions and the plan will be revised to safely control the highwall and provided for safe conditions.\nFor over three months, the mine operator developed the highwall in a manner that violated the provisions of the GCP.\u00a0 Also, management witnessed hazardous highwall conditions, such as stress cracks and poor stability, in the same general area of the accident in the previously developed highwall.\u00a0 The previous unsafe conditions served as a warning but management did not utilize appropriate safety measures to abate these hazards or barricade areas off to prevent miners\u2019 exposure.\u00a0 This violation is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory standard.104(a) Citation No. 9132945 was issued to Cedar Lake Mining, Inc. for violation of 30 CFR \u00a777.1713(a):On December 11, 2018, a Caterpillar 972G (Serial Number 4WW00619) front-end loader was operating near the base of a 63-foot high highwall to remove blasted material.\u00a0 A large portion of the highwall (approximately 7,000 \u2013 8,000 cubic yards of material) toppled onto the front-end loader, crushing the operator\u2019s cab and fatally injuring the miner.\u00a0 Evidence obtained through the fatal accident investigation revealed the first and second shift mine examiners performed inadequate daily inspections by failing to identify, report and correct the following violations of the Ground Control Plan (GCP) and hazardous highwall conditions:The immediate highwall at the site of the accident was 63 to 80 feet in height with no safety bench in place for approximately 3,000 linear feet.\n\t\u00a0\nThe top of the surface mine highwall had loose, unconsolidated rock and material in numerous

Mechanics, began their shift.\u00a0 They spent the morning performing maintenance on several mining vehicles. \u00a0Then they went to a garage located at the facility to have lunch.While in the garage, David Morgan, Mine Superintendent, modified the hydraulic system on the Ford F-550 service truck that he used at the mine.\u00a0 He removed the hydraulic hose reel and replaced it with a hose coupling connecting the hoses together. \u00a0Morgan then removed the hydraulic oil cooler and plugged its lines with fittings.\u00a0 He started the truck to check for hydraulic leaks, checked the operation of a bed-mounted crane, and then turned off the truck.After Ney finished his lunch, Morgan asked him if he knew anything about the hydraulics in the right rear compartment of the truck. \u00a0Ney told Morgan to start the truck and he looked inside the hydraulic compartment.\u00a0 Morgan told Ney he was going to turn off the truck because exhaust fumes were accumulating where Ney was standing.\u00a0 Morgan heard a pop just before he turned off the truck.\u00a0 He walked to the rear of the truck and saw Ney laying on the floor with an injury above his right eye.Seasock returned to

Administration (MSHA) personnel conducted the accident investigation in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mine Safety (PA BMS) and company personnel.\u00a0 The investigators conducted interviews with miners and photographed the accident scene.\u00a0 Jonathan Hall, Mechanical Engineer with Technical Support, conducted an investigation of the hydraulic system on the truck on November 30, 2018.\u00a0 See Appendix A for a list of persons interviewed and those participating in the accident investigation.", "DISCUSSION": "Truck and Hydraulic InformationThe service truck involved in the accident was a 2009 Ford F-550 purchased by the mine operator in September 2018. \u00a0The truck was equipped with a power take off hydraulic pump, a Stellar 6620 crane, and outriggers. \u00a0The truck also had a hose reel containing hydraulic hoses and a hydraulic cooling radiator, which were used for external hydraulic tools.An \u201con-off\u201d switch on a panel near the rear of the truck controlled whether hydraulic pressure was directed to the hose reel or the crane. \u00a0The \u201con\u201d position typically sent up to 200 psi to the reel while the \u201coff\u201d position sent up to 3,000 psi to the crane (see Appendix B).\u00a0 On the day of the accident, Morgan had modified the hydraulic system to direct 3,000 psi to the reel instead of the typical 200 psi when the switch was in the \u201con\u201d position.\u00a0 He told investigators that he modified the hydraulic system to remove components that were not needed for operation of the crane. \u00a0The hydraulic reel circuit included a brass compression fitting that held a temperature sensor (see Appendix C).\u00a0 The fitting had a maximum rating of 800 psi which is significantly less than the 3,000 psi it was subjected to after Morgan modified the hydraulic system.\u00a0 Ney was examining this area at the time of the accident (see Appendix D).Likely ScenarioBased on a review of the evidence, inspectors believe it is most likely that Ney turned the on-off switch partially to the \u201con\u201d position while examining the hydraulic system at close range. \u00a0This would have directed excessive pressure to the hydraulic reel, causing the temperature sensor to burst from the fitting and strike the victim in the head.Once the victim was struck, the switch was released, causing it to move back to the \u201coff\u201d position.\u00a0 A small amount of hydraulic fluid was found after the accident.\u00a0 If the switch remained in the \u201con\u201d position after the victim was struck, hydraulic fluid would have continued to be pumped out of the fitting.\u00a0Training and ExperienceGeorge Ney had 29 years of mining experience at this mine.\u00a0 Ney\u2019s most recent annual refresher training was received on August 29, 2018.\u00a0 He had no task training on the Ford F-550 truck or the hydraulic system located on the truck.\u00a0 Task training should have included instruction in the safety and health aspects and safe work procedures of the hydraulic system.\u00a0 No course material, or operator\u2019s manual, was provided for training the miners to recognize and avoid hazards associated with the hydraulic system.Morgan was also not trained in the hydraulic system.\u00a0 He was unaware of the effect of the changes he made to the hydraulic system.\u00a0 The mine operator should have ensured that Morgan, Ney, and Seasock were properly trained, and that the hydraulic system was depressurized, before Morgan modified the hydraulic system and asked Ney to work on it.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \u00a0A root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective action that was implemented to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not provide adequate task training on the hydraulic system on the truck before miners performed work on the hydraulic system.\nCorrective Action: \u00a0The mine operator developed new task training incorporating best practices.\u00a0 The operator provided new task training to miners who maintain and/or repair hydraulic systems.\u00a0 This training included safe work procedures when working on hydraulic systems, with instruction to not pressurize hydraulic systems prior to the completion of repairs.\u00a0", "CONCLUSION": "On Thursday, November 29, 2018, at approximately 1:05 p.m., George Ney, a 50-year-old mechanic with 29 years of mining experience received a critical injury while examining the hydraulic system on a service truck.\u00a0 The hydraulic system had been modified earlier that day, causing excessive pressure to flow to a fitting that burst, propelling a temperature sensor into his forehead. The victim died of his injuries on December 30, 2018.The accident occurred because Ney and other miners were not trained in safe procedures for working on the hydraulic system.\u00a0_________________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 _________________Russell J.
