Gilman, Quarry Manager; Paul Tipper, Equipment Operator; and Gary L. McAllister, Equipment Operator, arrived at 7:00 a.m. for the morning shift. \u00a0Tipper began operating the excavator and noticed there was a hydraulic oil leak in the mechanism that latched the hammer to the quick coupler.\u00a0 Tipper notified Gilman of the leak, and Gilman and McAllister examined the equipment. They were unable to find the cause and location of the hydraulic oil leak. \u00a0To prevent further leakage, Gilman removed the two hydraulic oil hoses connected to the quick coupler latching mechanism and load-locking valve arrangement.\u00a0 Gilman then covered (capped) the two ports on the load-locking valve arrangement of the quick coupler and the two hydraulic supply ports on the excavator boom.At approximately 10:45 a.m., Charbonneau arrived at the mine site and Gilman and McAllister informed him that the hydraulic ports had been capped.\u00a0 He spoke with Gilman and McAllister about the decision to cap the hydraulic ports.\u00a0 The three men examined the latching mechanism before deciding to proceed. McAllister moved the excavator from the quarry to the crusher and informed Root that the hydraulic ports had been capped. \u00a0Root then began operating the excavator.Charbonneau and McAllister walked to the crusher work platform to guide the excavator into position to remove the old motor.\u00a0 Charbonneau was standing next to the crusher booth on the east side of the platform.\u00a0 McAllister was standing on the west side of the platform, just above the crusher flywheel (see Appendix A). \u00a0Root began to position the excavator\u2019s boom and hammer while Charbonneau and McAllister directed him with hand signals. \u00a0Charbonneau was standing below the hammer, which was approximately 7.5 feet above the work platform.\u00a0 When Root rotated the hammer to the horizontal position, the hammer fell from the quick coupler, striking Charbonneau in the head, knocking him down, and pinning him to the work platform.McAllister yelled for help.\u00a0 Gilman, who was returning from parking his truck, grabbed a chain and used it to attach the hammer to the excavator boom.\u00a0 Root used the excavator to lift the hammer off of Charbonneau.\u00a0 Miners were not able to completely remove Charbonneau from under the hammer until additional equipment was brought to the site.\u00a0 The additional equipment was needed because the excavator did not have the lifting capacity due to the loss of hydraulic oil.At approximately 11:55 a.m., Gilman called 911 and requested medical assistance.\u00a0 At 12:03 p.m., emergency medical crews arrived at the mine site, and at 12:13 p.m., Steven Stryker, AmCare Ambulance Paramedic, pronounced the victim dead do to extensive trauma.", "INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT": "At 12:14 p.m., Gilman called the Department of Labor National Contact Center (DOLNCC).\u00a0 The DOLNCC notified Dennis Yesko, MSHA\u2019s Northeastern District Assistant District Manager, who dispatched John Burton, Mine Safety and Health Inspector, to the mine site.\u00a0 Upon arrival, Burton secured the scene and ensured the safety of the miners.\u00a0At 5:11 p.m., Everett G. Kinser and Daniel F. Pullen, Mine Safety and Health Inspectors in MSHA\u2019s Portsmouth, New Hampshire field office, arrived on the scene to conduct the fatal accident investigation.\u00a0 Upon arrival, Kinser issued a 103(k) order.\u00a0 MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team conducted a physical examination of the accident scene, interviewed five mine employees and seven contractor employees, reviewed training documentation, and examined work procedures relevant to the accident.\u00a0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, mine employees, local law enforcement, and rescue agencies.\u00a0 See Appendix B for a list of persons participating in the investigation.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of AccidentThe accident occurred on the west side of the crusher control booth on a Cedarapids portable jaw crusher work platform (see Appendix C).WeatherThe weather at the time of the accident was cloudy with an average temperature of 80\u00b0 F. \u00a0Investigators did not consider weather to be a factor in the accident.Equipment InvolvedThe equipment involved in the accident was a Caterpillar 325B L excavator, product identification number 2JR02784. \u00a0At the time of the accident, the excavator was equipped with a Fleco 325B C-linkage quick coupler and a Gorilla GHB150 hydraulic hammer (see Appendix D).\u00a0 This attachment assembly was provided and installed by Perry\u2019s Equipment Inc. of Swanton, Vermont several years prior to the accident.The hammer was secured to the excavator\u2019s quick coupler by a latch.\u00a0 The hammer has a carrier on one side that connects to the quick coupler, and the latch holds the hammer\u2019s carrier securely.\u00a0 Two systems cause the latch to remain closed and hold the hammer\u2019s carrier securely.\u00a0 The two systems are the primary latching system and the secondary latching system.Primary Latching SystemThe primary latching system is controlled by a hydraulic cylinder. \u00a0When the hydraulic cylinder is extended, it closes the latch, and when the hydraulic cylinder is retracted, it opens the latch.\u00a0 The primary latching system is designed so that hydraulic pressure, on the extend side of the hydraulic cylinder, causes the hydraulic cylinder to keep the latch in the closed position at all times when the excavator is operating.\u00a0 The latch will remain closed unless a series of switches inside the cab are used to open the latch. \u00a0A check valve prevents the latch from opening if hydraulic power to the extend side of the hydraulic cylinder is lost.Disconnected and Damaged Hydraulic SystemAs mentioned earlier, Gilman removed the two hydraulic hoses connected to the hydraulic cylinder from the excavator and installed caps on all four fittings. In addition, investigators found that the tube welded to the extend side of the hydraulic cylinder was cracked and the tube welded to the retract side of the hydraulic cylinder was broken into two pieces. This defeated the load locking valve feature for the latch and allowed a constant flow of hydraulic oil to leak (see Appendices F and G).Secondary Latching SystemA secondary latching system used a safety pin arrangement to mechanically keep the latch from opening (see Appendices E and H).\u00a0 The safety pin can be inserted into one of two holes in excavator\u2019s quick coupler.\u00a0 The proper hole depends on the amount of separation of the two pins in the hammer\u2019s carrier.\u00a0 The operator\u2019s manual for the quick coupler indicated that the maximum recommended pin separation for the type of pins in the hammer\u2019s carrier, is 475 mm.\u00a0 The separation of the pins in hammer\u2019s carrier was 520 mm which circumvented the safety pin as a secondary means of securely holding the hammer\u2019s carrier. \u00a0\u00a0SummaryWhen Root rotated the hammer to the horizontal position, the weight of the hammer on the latch and hydraulic cylinder forced hydraulic oil out of the cracked tube and through a broken weld where the load locking valve arrangement was welded in place.\u00a0 As the hydraulic oil evacuated the tube, the latch opened. \u00a0The secondary means also failed due to the incompatibility of the quick coupler and hammer\u2019s carrier. \u00a0The hammer fell because the primary and secondary latching systems could not serve their intended function.Training and ExperienceCharbonneau had over 14 years of mining experience, all with Northeast.\u00a0 MSHA determined there were no contributory training deficiencies.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "The accident investigation team conducted a root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the accident.\u00a0 The team identified the following root causes and the mine operator implemented the corresponding corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\u00a0 The accident occurred because the operator did not repair the disconnected and damaged hydraulic cylinder assembly for the quick coupler or remove it from service after discovering a hydraulic oil leak.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The quick coupler involved in the accident was removed from service.\u00a0 Mine management and miners have been reinstructed on the provisions of 30 CFR \u00a7 56.14100 including the removal of unsafe equipment that affects the safety of miners.Root Cause:\u00a0 The accident occurred because the operator used an incompatible carrier attachment. \u00a0The mismatched equipment components circumvented the secondary latching system allowing the hammer to disengage from the quick coupler when the primary means of latching failed.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 Management removed the quick coupler from the excavator and adopted a policy eliminating the use of quick coupling devices at this operation. \u00a0The operator will ensure that all equipment is used within the design capacity of the manufacturer.", "CONCLUSION": "Ryan I.

ACCIDENT": "On June 10, 2019, Sawasky arrived at the mine site at 6:00 a.m., to continue installing electrical lines for a new plant.\u00a0 Premier\u2019s Foreman, Greg Turcotte, met with Sawasky and Travis Hegemann, Journeyman Electrician, to conduct the morning safety briefing and discuss the day\u2019s tasks.\u00a0 The three men walked over to a trench for electrical lines, to see the impact of a recent rain event.Turcotte determined the trench was too muddy to work safely, so he coordinated with Joseph Peters, Plant Manager, to remove the mud.\u00a0 Peters used an excavator to clear the mud from the trench.\u00a0 He also placed a six-by-two-foot concrete block at the head of the trench to serve as a mounting structure for an electrical junction box.\u00a0 Before leaving the area, Turcotte coordinated with Peters to replace the mud with crushed rock.\u00a0 Turcotte then left the mine site to obtain additional construction material.\u00a0 Bruce Batson, Maintenance/Equipment Operator, delivered approximately half a bucket of crushed stone using a Caterpillar 980H front-end loader.\u00a0 He put some stone into the trench and dumped the remainder along the trench for later placement.Hegemann coordinated with Peters to bring an additional four loads of crusher fines to the trench to use as bedding for the conduit.\u00a0 Peters operated a Wacker Neuson WL36 front-end loader to deliver the crusher fines from a nearby stockpile. \u00a0A pile of crushed rock, other materials, and equipment in front of and adjacent to the trench impeded Peters\u2019 approach to the trench.\u00a0 Peters had to approach the trench at about a 30-degree angle and then turn to the right, which placed the bucket of the front-end loader parallel to the trench (see Appendix A).Hegemann acted as a spotter for Peters when he dumped the first three buckets of crusher fines into the trench. \u00a0After Peters dumped the third bucket of crusher fines, Hegemann got in the trench to mount steel struts to the concrete block for the junction box.\u00a0 Sawasky stood next to him, assisting.\u00a0 Hegemann was not spotting when Peters delivered the fourth load.At approximately 11:10 a.m., as Peters was preparing to dump the fourth load, the right-front wheel of the front-end loader went over the edge and into the trench.\u00a0 Peters yelled out a warning and Hegemann jumped back out of the way.\u00a0 The front-end loader rolled and slid down into the trench, with its bumper coming to rest on the concrete block.Hegemann watched Peters climb out of the front-end loader cab and then turned to see that Sawasky was pinned between the front-end loader and the concrete block.\u00a0 Hegemann called to Turcotte, who had returned to the site, to call 911.\u00a0 He then climbed to the top of the block and tried to speak to Sawasky, who was not responsive.Peters assisted emergency medical services by using a large excavator to lift the fallen front-end loader to free Sawasky at 11:25 a.m.\u00a0 Kelli Derleth, Medicolegal Death Investigator, examined Sawasky and pronounced him dead at 12:06 p.m.\u00a0", "INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT": "At 11:31 a.m., Brandon Clemons, Vulcan\u2019s Safety Representative, called the Department of Labor\u2019s National Contact Center (DOLNCC).\u00a0 At 11:43 a.m., the DOLNCC contacted David Allen, MSHA Southeastern District Safety Specialist, who dispatched Scottie Sizemore, Mine Safety and Health Inspector, and Darren Conn, Supervisory Mine Safety and Health Inspector, in MSHA\u2019s Franklin, Tennessee field office, to the mine site.\u00a0 Sizemore and Conn arrived at 1:24 p.m., and issued an order under Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to secure the scene and ensure the safety of miners.Rory Smith, Supervisory Mine Safety and Health Inspector, in MSHA\u2019s Birmingham, Alabama field office and Kevin Hardester, Mine Safety and Health Inspector, arrived on the scene at 4:30 p.m., to conduct a fatal injury accident investigation.\u00a0 MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team conducted a physical examination of the accident scene, interviewed five mine employees and seven contractor employees, reviewed training documentation, and examined work procedures relevant to the accident.\u00a0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, miners, and contractors. \u00a0See Appendix B for a list of persons participating in the investigation.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of AccidentThe accident occurred in an area where the operator was building a secondary processing plant.\u00a0 The electrical contractors were preparing to place electrical conduit and a junction box in a trench at the perimeter of the new plant site.\u00a0 The trench was approximately seven-feet wide and ranged from four to six feet deep.\u00a0 The walls were slightly sloped (see Appendix C), and there was a shallow ramp at the head of the trench for access.\u00a0EquipmentA Wacker Neuson WL36, front-end loader, Serial #3025335, with a bucket capacity of .8 cubic yards was involved in the accident (see Appendix D). \u00a0\u00a0River Road Quarry has only one front-end loader of this model and they have trained multiple miners to operate it.\u00a0 There were no documented mechanical issues with the front-end loader.\u00a0 Maintenance records did not indicate any current or recurring issues.\u00a0 After inspecting pre-operational examination records and conducting interviews, the accident investigators concluded that the mine operator was performing required examinations and there were no reported safety defects or concerns prior to the accident.Weather ConditionsThe weather at the time of the accident was mostly cloudy, no precipitation, and a temperature of 77\u00b0 F. \u00a0Rainfall over the previous weekend made further excavation of the trench necessary to correct the muddy conditions.\u00a0 Investigators did not consider the weather to be a factor in the accident.Training and ExperiencePeters received training in operating the front-end loader.\u00a0 He had approximately six months of experience at this site and approximately three years of total mining experience.\u00a0 Collin Sawasky\u2019s training records indicated he had received new miner training; site-specific training; annual refresher training; and task training on various pieces of equipment.\u00a0", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "The accident investigation team conducted a root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the accident.\u00a0 The team identified the following root causes and the mine operator implemented the corresponding corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not maintain control of the front-end loader to prevent overtravel into the trench.\nCorrective Action: The mine operator provided additional training to all equipment operators on how to operate equipment in a safe and controlled manner.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not use berms or other limiting devices to prevent overtravel of equipment when approaching a drop-off to dump material.\nCorrective Action: The mine operator developed and implemented new policies and procedures to ensure miners\u2019 safety when dumping material near an edge of a drop-off, and provided training to miners in the new policies and procedures.", "CONCLUSION": "Collin Sawasky died when a front-end loader toppled into the trench where he and a coworker were installing electrical conduit.\u00a0 The accident occurred because the equipment operator did not maintain control of the front-end loader to prevent overtravel into the trench and the mine operator did not provide berms or other devices to prevent

Huskey directed Dean to go to the section power center to call outside and get first aid supplies. \u00a0At the power center, Dean called David Eldridge, Security Officer, to alert him of the accident and request an ambulance.\u00a0 Eldridge contacted Thomas Loving of Human Resources and Loving called 911, the Department of Labor National Contact Center (DOL Contact Center), and the Kentucky Division of Mine Safety (KDMS).\u00a0Dean also called mine foreman Tommy Vannatter who was on the 001 MMU at the time of the accident. \u00a0T. Vannatter immediately went to help transport North to the surface.When Dean returned to the accident scene, he moved his shuttle car to clear the way for Huskey to pull in with the personnel carrier. \u00a0The crew placed North on the backboard and into the carrier and transported him to the surface. \u00a0North never lost consciousness during this time.After arriving on the surface at 7:08 p.m., North was transferred to medical personnel with LifeGuard Ambulance Service, who transported him about two miles to a designated landing zone.\u00a0 At 7:30 p.m., he was flown by AirMedCare to the Johnson City Medical Center in Johnson City, Tennessee.\u00a0 North underwent several surgical procedures at the Medical Center, and died of complications from his injuries on May 30, 2019. \u00a0", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On May 22, 2019, at 7:30 p.m., Loving notified the DOL Contact Center of a life threatening injury accident.\u00a0 The DOL Contact Center notified Marvin Hoskins, MSHA Hazard, KY Field Office Supervisor (FOS), who in turn notified Craig Plumley, Assistant District Manager for Enforcement. \u00a0Plumley directed William C. Clark, MSHA Barbourville, KY FOS, to travel to the mine and assist with the accident investigation.\u00a0At the time of the accident, Jack Harris, MSHA Inspector, was conducting inspection activities on the 001 MMU. \u00a0As noted earlier, T. Vannatter went to help transport North to the surface as soon as he heard about the accident.\u00a0 When T. Vannatter returned to the 001 MMU, he found Harris, and informed him of the accident. \u00a0Harris and T. Vannatter then traveled to the accident scene. \u00a0At 8 p.m., Harris issued a 103(k) order, conducted an imminent danger run, and took photos and preliminary measurements of the accident scene.\u00a0 Clark arrived at the mine to assist Harris at approximately 9:00 p.m.On May 23, 2019, Dennis Cotton, Assistant District Manager for Technical, Kevin Doan, Roof Control Specialist, and Ricky L. Suffridge, Roof Control Specialist/Accident Investigator traveled to the mine to continue the investigation. \u00a0Cotton and Doan traveled to the accident site with KDMS investigators Billy Allen, Ernest Hawkins, Dustin Clem, and Brandon Morgan, Safety Director for Rex Coal Company, to evaluate the roof and rib conditions. \u00a0Meanwhile, Suffridge traveled to the 001 MMU with Allen Turner, Mine Superintendent, to evaluate roof and rib conditions at that location to see if hazardous conditions extended to the 001 MMU.\u00a0 Later that afternoon, Timothy L. Fugate, Chief Accident Investigator at KDMS, and Clark from MSHA arrived at the mine to join the investigation. \u00a0Investigators conducted preliminary interviews with most of the miners who had worked with North as they arrived for the start of the second shift. \u00a0After completing the interviews, investigators Suffridge, Clark, Fugate, Hawkins, Turner, and Morgan traveled underground to the 002 MMU and took additional photographs and measurements.On May 30, 2019, MSHA was notified that North had passed away at the Johnson City Medical Center.\u00a0 Interviews were conducted on Tuesday, June 4, 2019 at the MSHA Harlan Field Office (see Appendix B).On May 31, 2019 and June 1, 2019, Deborah B. Combs, Training Specialist with MSHA Educational Field and Small Mine Services, reviewed training records at the mine.", "DISCUSSION": "Accident SceneThe accident occurred at the intersection of the No. 3 heading and the No. 3 left crosscut (see Appendix A).\u00a0 During the shift before the accident, the No. 3 heading was mined and the No. 3 left crosscut was mined approximately 20 feet.\u00a0 These mined areas were roof bolted but no rib bolts were installed.Geologic ConditionsThe CVB No. 1 mine extracts coal from the Harlan coal seam and is overlain by abandoned workings in the Creech and High Splint coalbeds.\u00a0 The interburden between the Harlan and Creech coal seams averages 370 feet.\u00a0 The interburden between the Harlan and the High Splint seams averages 1,450 feet.The rock strata at the accident scene consisted of coal, cannel coal, and sandy shale (see Appendix C).\u00a0 The rock that fell onto the victim came from the upper layer of sandy shale, which was 24 inches in width at the scene of the accident.\u00a0 At the scene of the accident, the coal seam was starting to rise in elevation.\u00a0 The elevation in the coal seam at the scene of the accident caused instability, in that the inby crosscut pillar corner leaned toward the continuous mining machine operator\u2019s location.\u00a0Roof Control PlanThe approved roof control plan required rib bolting in areas with specific geological characteristics. \u00a0For example, rib bolting was required where the overburden was 1,000 feet. \u00a0The overburden on the 002 MMU at the time of the accident was 900 feet so it did not meet the criteria requiring rib bolting.ExaminationsInvestigators reviewed preshift and onshift examination records for two months before the fatal accident.\u00a0 Rib hazards were frequently documented in these records.\u00a0 The records, and conditions in the mine, showed that the mine operator scaled loose rock and installed rib bolts as conditions were observed. \u00a0The rib bolts installed were 6-foot fully grouted bolts spaced on 8 foot centers (horizontally).\u00a0 Despite these efforts by the mine operator, rib hazards continued to develop.\u00a0On May 22, 2019, the day of the accident, preshift examination records for the 002 MMU showed two notations regarding ribs: \u201cLoose Rib\u201d under the heading of \u201cHazardous Condition(s)\u201d, and \u201cPulled\u201d under the heading, \u201cAction Taken.\u201d\u00a0 The on-shift examination record for that day listed one remark concerning the ribs, \u201cPulled loose ribs & drawrock.\u201d\u00a0 In preshift and on-shift examination records for the 7 days prior to the accident, there were notations of loose ribs.\u00a0 All of these rib hazards were noted as being pulled down to remove the hazard.\u00a0 The preshift and on-shift examination records were signed and countersigned as required.Post-accident interviews of the 002 MMU miners and supervisor indicated that the rib that caused the accident did not appear hazardous prior to falling.Roof Bolting Machines on the 002 MMUTwo types of roof bolting machines were utilized on the 002 MMU.\u00a0 One machine only installed roof bolts. \u00a0The other bolting machine was a mast-head drill primarily used to install rib bolts.\u00a0 On occasion, if the roof bolting was lagging, the operator would use the mast-head drill to roof bolt and rib bolt.The mine operator was installing rib bolts in the area of the accident.\u00a0 However, rib bolts provide the best protection when they are installed at the same time as roof bolts and in a consistent pattern.\u00a0 Rib bolts on the 002 MMU were not being installed at the same time as the roof bolts.TrainingCombs reviewed training records and determined that North\u2019s training was up-to-date.\u00a0 He had received continuous mining machine task training on December 28, 2018, annual refresher training on October 13, 2018, and experienced miner training on November 11, 2018.\u00a0 Combs determined all 29 second shift employees\u2019 training records were up-to-date and found no training deficiencies.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 A root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.\u00a0Listed below is the root cause identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions which were implemented to prevent a recurrence.\u00a0Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not effectively control the ribs and pillar corners on the 002 MMU in areas where the miners were working and traveling to protect them from hazards related to falls of the ribs.\u00a0 A portion of a coal/rock rib weighing about 2,000 pounds and measuring 48-to-54 inches long, 24 inches wide, and 28 inches thick fell on the 002

(See Appendix B). West Amarillo installed the cone crusher and a new feed belt between May 2, 2019 and May 5, 2019, and started operating them on May 6, 2019. \u00a0The mine encountered material flow problems with the feed belt and feed box from the beginning and made several modifications to try to resolve the issues. \u00a0When a stoppage occurred, miners accessed the feed box from above by using a personnel lift, or from the crusher platform below, using a steel pry bar to break the stoppage loose.\u00a0\u00a0Personnel LiftThe personnel lift is a Snorkel Model # TB-60D7, Serial # MY07112 (See Appendix C). \u00a0At the time of the accident, the bottom of the basket was 28 feet above the ground. \u00a0The boom was extended to a length of 37 feet, 2 inches, measured from the rear boom pin to the basket pin. \u00a0Activity Involved in the AccidentThe investigation team concluded that Ramirez would have positioned the basket directly above the cone crusher to access the feed box.\u00a0 The team found a pry bar and belt scraper bushing on the ground approximately 31 feet from the platform.\u00a0 In interviews, miners said that in the past, miners used the pry bar to free blockage in the cone crusher feed box.The basket\u2019s torque plate was found to be damaged which caused the basket to move laterally, uncontrolled by the operator.\u00a0 The investigation team could not determine if the damage to the torque plate was the result of the bottom of the basket contacting a dowel pin on top of the cone crusher.\u00a0 Based on witness accounts, Ramirez was tramming the personnel lift away from the cone crusher structure just prior to the accident.\u00a0 Witnesses said the basket appeared to bounce up and down and the victim cartwheeled over the edge of the basket.\u00a0 The terrain, speed, damage to the torque plate, and the boom arm extended 37 feet were factors causing the basket to move in an uncontrolled manner.Fall ProtectionWest Amarillo\u2019s policy states that fall protection must be used where required and the user must be properly tied off in all applicable situations.\u00a0 Ramirez had been trained on this policy.\u00a0 Although the policy did not specifically address tie off procedures in a personnel lift basket, the basket had a label warning equipment operators to wear fall protection at all times. The victim was wearing a fall protection harness and a six foot retractable lanyard, but the lanyard was not tied off at the time of the accident.WeatherThe weather at the time of the accident was clear, with light winds, and a temperature of 51\u02daF.\u00a0 Weather was not a factor in the accident.", "TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE": "In October 2018, Richard E.

He used the crane to remove various tools and equipment from the quarry.\u00a0 According to Fernando Sigale, Flagman, Roth\u2019s operation of the crane was normal and routine.\u00a0 Roth began to lift the first piece of granite between 11:15 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. The procedure was normal until the granite cleared the top of the highwall, at which time the crane boom began lowering. \u00a0Sigale yelled at Roth but did not get a response. \u00a0As the boom lowered with its 15-ton load, the crane began to tip over. Sigale said Roth grabbed each side of the window frame and was looking straight ahead as the crane tipped over and fell into the quarry approximately 80 to 85 feet below.\u00a0At the time of the accident, David Streetman, Blue Ridge Quarry Foreman, was loading a truck approximately 50 yards away.\u00a0 He did not witness the crane go over the highwall but heard the resulting crash.\u00a0 Shane Robertson, Eagles Danburg Quarry-Site 2 Foreman, was helping diamond saw a block of granite at the north end of the quarry, approximately 200 to 250 feet from the crash site, and witnessed the crane fall from the highwall.\u00a0 He saw the crane complete a 360\u00b0 roll before it landed on its wheels.Kyle Burden, Drill Helper who was trained in first-aid, arrived on scene and checked Roth for a pulse but did not find one.\u00a0 Burden observed severe lacerations on Roth\u2019s left side and right hand.\u00a0 Robertson called 911 at 11:31 a.m., and Burden remained at the scene until Emergency Medical Services arrived.\u00a0 Roth was pronounced dead at the mine site by Howard Sanders, Ogelthrope County Coroner, at 11:45 a.m.\u00a0 The cause of death was extensive trauma.", "INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT": "At 11:39 a.m., David Streetman called the Department of Labor\u2019s National Contact Center (DOLNCC).\u00a0 The DOLNCC contacted Judith Etterer, MSHA Southeastern District Staff Assistant, at 11:55 a.m.\u00a0 MSHA Inspector Ken Cumming was dispatched to the mine site.\u00a0 Upon arrival, Cumming issued an order under Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to secure the scene and ensure the safety of miners.MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team:\u00a0 James M.

DeBoard parked his front-end loader and came to the highwall mining machine to assist. \u00a0DeBoard shoveled mud from the rails, located beside the chain, after each push beam was removed (see Appendix A). \u00a0At approximately 1:30 p.m., while standing near the push beam holder (holder) on the side of the machine, DeBoard\u2019s head was caught between the 14th push beam being removed and a stationary metal support post. \u00a0Wade Nichols, Foreman/Operator, witnessed DeBoard fall and he immediately pressed the emergency stop button to de-energize the machine.Nichols instructed John Livesay, Fork Loader Operator, to get an emergency medical technician (EMT).\u00a0 Livesay traveled just outside the highwall mining machine pit where Josh Bragg, Electrician, and Richie Milam, Maintenance Superintendent/EMT, were servicing a gasoline welder. \u00a0Livesay informed Milam that an accident had occurred at the highwall mining machine and he was needed there immediately.\u00a0 When Milam arrived at the accident scene, he instructed Mark Chapman, Padman, to get first-aid supplies. \u00a0Nichols and Milam positioned DeBoard on his back and assessed his vital signs. \u00a0Nichols and Milam did not find a pulse so they began to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\u00a0 Livesay notified Josh Sturgill, Mine Superintendent, of the accident. \u00a0Sturgill dispatched four additional EMTs from the Blue Knob Surface Mine to the accident scene.\u00a0 They were: \u00a0Frankie Phares and Ray Kincaid, Truck Drivers; David Brown, Bulldozer Operator; and Markie Holcomb, Front-End Loader Operator.Redi-Care Ambulance Service from Craigsville, West Virginia arrived at the accident scene at 2:02 p.m., and took control of care of DeBoard.\u00a0 Redi-Care personnel ruled DeBoard to be in traumatic cardiac arrest and contacted Dr. Jerry Edwards at Medbase.\u00a0 Dr. Edwards gave 2:44 p.m. as a time of death and DeBoard was transported to Greenbrier Valley Medical Center in Ronceverte, West Virginia.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On March 7, 2019, at 1:49 p.m., the Department of Labor National Contact Center was notified of the accident.\u00a0 At 2:03 p.m., the contact center notified Thomas Dulin, Mine Inspector. \u00a0Dulin notified David S. Mandeville, District Manager, that there had been a serious accident at the HWM 61 mine. \u00a0At 2:05 p.m., Mandeville notified Franklin Stover, Surface Mine Inspector/Accident Investigator, and Fred Wills, Field Office Supervisor, of the accident.Stover, along with Wills, Mandeville, and Joey Presley, Staff Assistant, traveled to the Summersville Field Office where they met with Kelly Acord, Special Investigations Supervisor/Acting Field Office Supervisor, and Joe Morris, Mine Safety and Health Inspector. \u00a0The team traveled to the accident scene and arrived at 5:00 p.m.\u00a0 Stover issued a 103(k) order to preserve the accident scene, prevent the destruction of evidence, and ensure the safety of all persons at the mine.\u00a0 Stover and Morris gathered preliminary information, examined the accident scene, and took photographs.On Friday, March 8, 2019, Stover, Robert Hatfield, Electrical Supervisor, and Larry Hedrick, Electrical Specialist, traveled to the mine site to perform function testing of the highwall mining machine. \u00a0The function testing was conducted in conjunction with representatives from West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST).On March 13, 2019, MSHA and WVOMHST jointly conducted formal interviews at the WVOMHST Office in Oak Hill, West Virginia.\u00a0 See Appendix B for a list of persons interviewed and those participating in the accident investigation.On March 20, 2019, Stover, Hedrick, and John Stone, Electrical Specialist, along with Patrick Retzer, Electrical Engineer with MSHA Technical Support, Ron Furrow, Owner and Electrical Engineer with Synergy Global Group, and WVOMHST, traveled to the mine site to download data from the highwall mining machine\u2019s Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), an industrial computer, and two human machine interface (HMI) touchscreen panels.\u00a0 They also completed function testing.", "DISCUSSION": "Highwall Mining MachineThe highwall mining machine is used to mine holes that are several hundred feet deep, while miners remain on the surface.\u00a0 The system involves a cutter module that operates like a continuous mining machine, a push beam that is connected to the cutter module, and additional push beams connected to the first push beam and each other, forming a train of push beams.\u00a0 The push beams allow the power head to push the cutter module deeper into the hole being mined.\u00a0 The coal that is mined is conveyed, via an auger system in each push beam, to a belt on the surface.After a hole is finished, the push beams and cutter module are removed from the mined hole. \u00a0The power head, controlled by the higwall mining machine operator, moves toward the highwall and connects to the push beam to be removed.\u00a0 Once connected, the power head retracts, pulling the push beam and the cutter module backward so that it is under the cradle/hoist.\u00a0 The cradle/hoist lifts the push beam and places it in the holder.\u00a0 A forklift removes the push beam from the holder and places it in a storage area.\u00a0 This process continues until all of the push beams and cutter module are removed from the hole that was mined (see Appendix A).The push beams being used are 20 feet 7 inches long and 6 feet 10 inches wide. \u00a0They measure 1 foot 8 inches thick and weigh up to 14,000 lbs. \u00a0The push beams are loaded and removed by an overhead hydraulic crane/hoist.The highwall mining machine was manufactured in 2008 by Superior Highwall Miners S/N 61 and it was purchased from Commonwealth Mining in March 2016.\u00a0 Function testing was conducted on the hydraulic system of the highwall mining machine and nothing was found that contributed to the accident.Functional testing and an inspection were conducted on the electrical system on the highwall mining machine, emergency stop system, and power generator. \u00a0No defects were found that contributed to the accident.The Industrial Computer was removed from the highwall mining machine control cab and taken to the National Mine Health and Safety Academy in Beckley, West Virginia, where the data was downloaded by Furrow and Retzer. \u00a0The communication ports for the HMIs were damaged, which prevented data storage on the computer since November of 2018.Accident SceneWhen the accident investigation team arrived at the scene the temperature was 27\u00ba F.\u00a0 Ice was present on the machine handrails.\u00a0 The area around the machine was wet and muddy.The highwall mining machine was found with a push beam resting in the holder and the cradle/hoist positioned over top of this beam (see Appendix A).Investigators determined that the victim was standing on a small section (18 inches by 12.5 inches) of metal (travelway) between the ladder leading up to the second level of the machine and the steps that lead to the ground.\u00a0 It was common practice for a miner to stand in this small area, to shovel the mud that accumulates on the rails, as the push beams are removed from the mined hole.\u00a0 The mud has to be removed after each push beam is removed, to allow the power head to extend and properly connect to the next beam.There was mud present on the walking surfaces of the highwall mining machine from being tracked onto the machine by miners as they got on and off of the machine.\u00a0 Some mud and small amounts of coal were on the travelway where the victim was standing at the time of the accident.The small section where the victim was standing was not intended to be a work area because of the proximity of the moving push beams.\u00a0 This area was designated for miners to step on momentarily as they got on and off the machine.\u00a0 Each push beam was moving approximately 12 to 18 inches in front of the victim as it was raised, moved horizontally, and lowered by the cradle/hoist to the holder. \u00a0The Superior Highwall Miners Safety, Operation, and Maintenance Manual, states on page one:Avoid placing yourself in or near pinch areas that exist between moving parts.Investigators determined that the victim was repeatedly standing in a pinch area.\u00a0 The foremen and other miners knew the victim was standing in this location and told investigators they believed the area was a safe location for him to wait for the push beam to be moved to the holder.\u00a0 During interviews, they stated that it was common for someone to be in this location.\u00a0 They stated that this area was a travelway and the support post was between the landing area and the moving push beam.Instead of standing in this location, the victim should have waited on the platform.\u00a0 If positioned on the platform, each push beam removed would be moved away from the victim.\u00a0 After the push beam was placed in the holder, the victim could have shoveled the mud.\u00a0 The victim would have then returned to the platform before the highwall mining machine operator extended the power head to connect to the next beam to be removed.ExaminationAn on-shift examination was conducted by Wade Nichols around 10:00 a.m., on the day of the accident with no hazards recorded.\u00a0 Nichols did not see the victim standing in this location during the time he conducted his on-shift examination, but he was aware that the victim stood in this location when he shoveled mud off the push beams.TrainingAdam P. DeBoard began working for the mine operator on May 30, 2017. \u00a0He received task training on the highwall mining machine on May 30, 2018.\u00a0 This training was conducted by Rickie Milam.\u00a0 His last 8 hour Annual Refresher Training was September 22, 2018.The task training provided by the mine operator was not adequate because the training did not address the small area where the victim was standing as a pinch area as stated in the Superior Highwall Miners Safety, Operation, and Maintenance Manual.\u00a0 Investigators obtained this manual and learned that the mine operator did not have the section of the manual related to safety.\u00a0 Instead, the mine operator only had the section of the manual necessary to maintain the highwall mining machine in operating condition.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management control. \u00a0Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corrective actions that were implemented to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause: The task training provided by the mine operator was not adequate because the training did not address areas to avoid in or near pinch areas that exist between moving parts as stated in the Superior Highwall Miners Safety, Operation, and Maintenance Manual.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator provided an 8 hour training class for all miners which covered the Superior Highwall Miners Safety, Operation, and Maintenance Manual and identified the areas to avoid during operation. \u00a0Additionally, the mine operator revised their training plan to include a task training check list, and all miners have been task trained in accordance with the newly approved training plan.\n\nRoot Cause: The mine operator did not identify the work location where the accident occurred as a pinch area that needed to be avoided.\nCorrective Action: The mine operator has identified red zone areas that exist when push beams are being installed or removed. \u00a0A red zone drawing has been added to the ground control plan with the following requirement, \u201cNo persons may enter red zone areas unless the highwall mining machine is idle.\u201d\nThe area where the fatal accident occurred has been brightly painted and posted with warning signs.\u00a0 Also, physical barriers have been installed to prevent entry. \u00a0The back access steps on the holder side that provide access to this area from the ground have been removed. \u00a0A handrail has been installed across the access steps at the second level so no one can enter from the top area. \u00a0Cameras were installed with monitors located in the operator\u2019s compartment so the highwall mining machine operator can see if persons enter the red zone areas.\n\n", "CONCLUSION": "On Thursday, March 7, 2019, at approximately 1:30 p.m., Adam P. DeBoard, a 38-year- old front-end loader operator with 10 years of mining experience received fatal injuries when he was crushed between a metal support post on a highwall mining machine and a moving push beam.The accident occurred because the mine operator did not identify the location of the accident as a pinch area and did not train the victim to avoid the pinch area.\u00a0Approved By:\u00a0\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad________________________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0________________David S.

Slone (victim) and William McKamey, two contract survey crew members, arrived at the mine.\u00a0 They met with Jack Stump, Owner/Operator, to arrange transportation to the MMU.\u00a0 After arriving on the MMU at 9:15 a.m., they met with H. Randall Hensley, Section Foreman, to get details about where to begin setting survey stations, mapping, and taking mining height measurements.\u00a0 At this time, the continuous mining machine was loading in the No. 3 entry, so the survey crew began in the No. 6 entry and they planned to work toward the No. 4 entry.After lunch, Richard Lane, Shuttle Car Operator, began operating the No. 4 shuttle car and James Barnett, Roof Bolter, began operating the No. 2 shuttle car.\u00a0 Lane drove his shuttle car to the continuous mining machine which was in the left crosscut off the No. 2 entry (see Appendix A).McKamey set the survey instrument in the No. 4 entry and Slone went to the No. 3 entry to take entry height measurements.\u00a0 Slone walked to the front of the No. 2 shuttle car, took a mining height measurement, and then walked 20 feet outby in the No. 3 entry to continue taking measurements.\u00a0After being loaded with coal, Lane drove his shuttle car toward the feeder.\u00a0 At approximately 11:10 a.m., Lane turned into the No. 3 entry and traveled about 10 feet past the inby corner of the pillar and stopped.\u00a0 Lane saw that his shuttle car\u2019s trailing cable was caught around the service jack of Barnett\u2019s shuttle car.\u00a0 Lane and Barnett exited their shuttle cars and freed the cable.\u00a0 Lane continued to the left side of the feeder and Barnett traveled to the continuous mining machine.\u00a0After dumping the load into the feeder, Lane noticed that an electrical cable attached to the mine roof over the feeder was down.\u00a0 He exited his shuttle car and reattached the cable.\u00a0 When he turned around to get back into his shuttle car, he saw Slone lying in the No. 3 entry intersection, adjacent to the feeder.\u00a0 Lane went to Slone and found Slone had been run over by Lane\u2019s shuttle car.\u00a0 Lane then ran and alerted Barnett of the accident.At approximately 11:15 a.m., Lane went to the mine phone adjacent to the feeder and called Michael Runyon, Owner/Operator, and told him that a miner was seriously injured.\u00a0 Next, Lane went to the MMU first aid supplies to retrieve a blanket and a stretcher.\u00a0 Barnett ran and notified McKamey, Hensley, and the other miners of the accident.\u00a0\u00a0Hensley went to the accident scene and realized there was nothing that could be done.\u00a0 He instructed the miners to walk to the surface. McKamey came to the accident scene.\u00a0 Lane arrived with a blanket and they covered Slone.\u00a0 At approximately 11:20 a.m., Lane called outside and told Runyon the victim\u2019s identity and that he was deceased.\u00a0 McKamey and Lane walked to the surface.Runyon informed Stump of the accident then called emergency services.\u00a0 Stump called Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), District 7, Kentucky Division of Mine Safety (KDMS), and the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center.\u00a0MSHA and KDMS personnel arrived at the mine, and traveled to the accident scene with company personnel.\u00a0 Slone was placed on a personnel carrier and transported to the surface.\u00a0 At 11:49 a.m., the Bell County Ambulance Service arrived at the mine.\u00a0 When they arrived, Slone was placed into the ambulance.\u00a0 Jason Steele, Bell County Coroner, arrived shortly after 12:30 p.m., and pronounced Slone dead at 12:35 p.m.\u00a0", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On January 14, 2019, at 11:20 a.m., Stump notified Samuel R. Creasy, MSHA District 7 Manager, and Billy Allen, KDMS Inspector, to report the accident.\u00a0 At 11:25 a.m., Stump notified the DOL National Contact Center (Contact Center) of the accident.\u00a0 The Contact Center notified the District 7 Office at 11:40 a.m.\u00a0 Creasy assigned Ricky L. Suffridge, Roof Control Specialist/Accident Investigator, as the lead accident investigator.\u00a0 Creasy directed Dennis J. Cotton, Assistant District Manager/Technical; Argus Brock, Roof Control Supervisor; William C. Clark, Supervisory Coal Mine Inspector; Ronald D. Caudill, Health Specialist/Accident Investigator; and Sean G. Davenport, Electrical Specialist, to assist in the onsite investigation.\u00a0 They traveled to the mine to begin the accident investigation and were assisted by KDMS.When Suffridge arrived at the mine he issued a 103(k) order to protect the safety of persons at the mine.\u00a0 Brock, Caudill, and Suffridge along with KDMS personnel conducted informal interviews with miners.Once informal interviews were completed, Creasy, Brock, Clark, Suffridge, Caudill, and Davenport traveled underground with mine officials and KDMS investigators.\u00a0 Photographs and measurements of the accident scene were taken.\u00a0On January 15, 2019, Deborah B. Combs, Training Specialist with MSHA Educational Field and Small Mine Services, traveled to the mine to review training records of the mine operator and contractor.\u00a0On January 15, 2019, formal interviews were conducted jointly by MSHA and KDMS at the MSHA District 7 Office in Barbourville, Kentucky.\u00a0 See Appendix B for a list of persons interviewed and those participating in the accident investigation.\u00a0", "DISCUSSION": "Mine Operator and Coal Owner RelationshipThe contract between the mine operator and the coal owner requires the mining height to be at or below 54 inches.\u00a0 To verify compliance, the survey crew periodically measures the mining height on the MMU.\u00a0 Measurements are taken at 20 foot intervals in the center of each entry.\u00a0 Slone was taking mining height measurements in the No. 3 entry when he was struck by the shuttle car.Accident LocationInvestigators believe the accident occurred at approximately 11:10 a.m., when Lane turned the No. 4 shuttle car into the No. 3 entry at the switch-out location.\u00a0 The No. 4 shuttle car is 28 feet long and Slone\u2019s map was found about 30 feet from the inby corner of the pillar (see Appendix C).\u00a0 This would indicate that Slone had already been struck when Barnett and Lane exited their cars to free the shuttle car cable.No. 4 Shuttle CarThe No. 4 10SC32 shuttle car, serial number ET16606, was manufactured by Joy Manufacturing Company.\u00a0 The last weekly electrical examination on the shuttle car was conducted on January 12, 2019, and the examination record stated that a cable was repaired.The shuttle car was inspected after the accident.\u00a0 The brakes functioned properly and no permissibility violations were found, but one of the two headlights was inoperable.\u00a0 This light was on the side that the victim was located at the time of the accident.\u00a0 Interviews did not reveal that anyone had knowledge that the light was out on the shuttle car.TrainingSlone had over 30 years of experience as an underground miner and surveyor.\u00a0 He had been certified in the state of Kentucky as an underground miner and underground mine foreman, and he was certified in gas detection.The mine operator provided hazard training to Slone.\u00a0 Slone worked several years as a surveyor in other mines owned by TENNCO INC, and these other mines used the same mining methods and equipment as the Toms Fork Mine.\u00a0", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.\u00a0Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions which were implemented to prevent a recurrence.\u00a0Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not have effective policies, procedures, and controls to protect miners who are on foot from being contacted by moving mobile face equipment.\u00a0 The shuttle car operator\u2019s field of vision was greatly reduced due to the size/height of the shuttle car and the low mining height.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 On January 17, 2019, the mine operator submitted, and MSHA approved, a revision to the roof control plan that contains the following safety measures to protect miners travelling on foot on the working section.All persons entering the mine will wear a permissible LED light on the back of their hard hat.\nSurvey crew members will notify the mine operator of the working section to which they will be travelling.\nThe mine operator will notify the miners on the working section.\nThe survey crew will only work on the opposite side of the section of the mining activity.\u00a0 If the survey crew is in the belt entry, all mining activities will cease.\nLong reflective markers will be hung in each crosscut from the feeder to the face to show where the survey crew is working.\nWhen the survey crew is finished they will notify the mine operator who will notify the miners on the working section.\n\nOn January 20, 2019, all miners were trained by the mine operator on the provisions of the revised roof control plan.\u00a0 Documentation of miners receiving the training was provided.The No. 4 shuttle car has been removed from service until a camera system is installed on the shuttle car.\u00a0 The camera system will enable the shuttle car operator to have greater visibility in the area where the victim was located.\u00a0 Camera systems were also installed on the other shuttle cars.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not ensure that both headlights on the shuttle car were working properly to illuminate the direction of travel and warn miners traveling on foot.\u00a0 One headlight on the dump end of the shuttle car involved in the fatal accident was not operational.\u00a0\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator repaired the headlight and implemented a new pre-operational examination policy.\u00a0 The new policy requires the lights on shuttle cars to be examined, and repaired if necessary, before operating each shift.", "CONCLUSION": "On Monday, January 14, 2019, at approximately 11:10 a.m., Jeffery N. Slone, a 56-year-old survey crew member with 30 years of mining experience, was fatally injured when he was struck by a shuttle car traveling to the coal feeder.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, Slone was taking measurements of the mining height as part of his surveying duties.The accident occurred because the mine operator did not have effective policies, procedures, and controls to protect miners who are on foot from being contacted by moving mobile face equipment.\u00a0Samuel R.

Ditterline, Contract Laborer, reported to work on the 3rd shift which began at 11:00 p.m. \u00a0Harvey Niehaus, Assistant Mine Manager, was traveling through the main shaft bottom area and heard a \u201cwhistling\u201d sound near the stopping in the No. 4 entry between footage markers 200 and 300. \u00a0Niehaus continued traveling to check on a belt and electrical power move, and then returned and found the stopping was bowing in the center and leaking across the top.\u00a0 Niehaus told Jim Payne, Supply Man, to remove the supply trailers from the crosscut and bring one pallet of concrete blocks to the damaged stopping location.Niehaus next traveled to the 4 Left head drive area and told Matthew Wright, Johnny Hettercheidt, and Jason Wilson, Contract Laborers, to travel to the bottom area and start working on building a stopping inby the damaged stopping. \u00a0Niehaus stopped at the West Main head drive where Ditterline and John Holland, General Laborer, were working. \u00a0He

with Wright, Hettercheidt, and Wilson to build the stopping. \u00a0The area where they were building the new stopping had two 110 volt shop lights that needed to be removed. \u00a0To determine the location of the power cable that provided power to the lights, Ditterline traveled outby towards the pneumatic airlock doors located in the crosscut between entry 4 and entry 5 at footage markers 100 and 200 (see Appendix A). \u00a0He walked through the inby set of doors and closed them behind him, following the power cable for the lights. \u00a0Surveillance video shows that after Ditterline activated the outby set of pneumatic airlock doors, at 3:18 a.m., the indicator lights for the doors began flashing, which means the doors went into fault condition.\u00a0 There were no witnesses to what followed, but evidence indicated that Ditterline walked up to the doors, opened the slide access door and the airlock doors opened suddenly, hitting him and pinning him between one of the doors and the concrete barrier. \u00a0When the doors opened, Holland, Hettercheidt, Wright and Wilson could hear and feel the air velocity increase at the damaged stopping.Payne was working nearby and walked through the boot wash area to the shaft bottom. \u00a0Once at the hoist, Payne noticed the opened airlock doors and a leg extending through the slide access door.\u00a0 He ran toward the airlock doors and found Ditterline at 3:22 a.m., pinned behind the left airlock door.\u00a0 Ditterline was unresponsive.\u00a0 Payne immediately called on the radio for Holland to come to the shaft bottom. \u00a0Holland, Wright, Hettercheidt, and Wilson traveled to the shaft bottom to help.\u00a0 Holland tried to clear the fault condition at both sets of electronic sensors for the doors. \u00a0Once the doors started to close, Wilson and Hettercheidt pulled Ditterline out and laid him on his back.\u00a0 Ditterline was still unresponsive. \u00a0Wilson, who is an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), and Holland started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\u00a0 Hettercheidt assisted with CPR while Wright went to get an automated external defibrillator (AED) from the shop.Niehaus heard Payne call on the radio and traveled from the 9 Left mining section outby towards the bottom area. \u00a0Niehaus picked up Michael Welch, Contract Laborer/EMT and they proceeded to the accident scene.\u00a0 When Niehaus and Welch arrived, Wilson and Holland were still performing CPR. \u00a0An AED was applied to Ditterline, but the diagnostic function of the AED indicated that no shock be administered.\u00a0 They placed Ditterline on a backboard and carried him to the hoist for transport to the surface. \u00a0Upon arrival on the surface, Harre Ambulance service took over care of Ditterline and transported him to Hamilton Memorial Hospital.James Steven Bowling, Hamilton County Coroner, pronounced Ditterline dead at 4:45 a.m.\u00a0 Dr. James Jacoby, Forensic Pathologist, performed an autopsy and stated that Ditterline\u2019s death was due to a cardiomyopathy.\u00a0 Coroner Bowling listed cardiomyopathy as the cause of death on the State of Illinois Certificate of Death Worksheet.\u00a0 The worksheet also states that the manner of death was \u201cnatural.\u201dWhen a miner\u2019s death is not conclusively determined to be chargeable to the mining industry, MSHA submits the case, including facts and supporting information, to the MSHA Chargeability Review Committee (Review Committee) for a decision.\u00a0 The review committee has been in existence since 2008 and has reviewed over 500 cases.\u00a0 The Review Committee is currently comprised of the following persons:Reviewing Medical Official, Federal Occupational Health\nAssociate Solicitor for Mine Safety and Health\nDirector of the MSHA Office of Assessments\nDirector of the MSHA Office of Program Evaluation and Information Resources\nDirector of the MSHA Office of Educational Policy and Development (Chair)\nAfter a thorough review of the facts and medical information, the Review Committee found that, \u201cacute stress cardiomyopathy can occur when an individual is exposed to sudden, intense physical or emotional (grief, fear) stress which causes rapid and severe heart muscle weakness. \u00a0Acute stress cardiomyopathy can mimic a myocardial infarction (a heart attack) even in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cBecause 1) Mr. Ditterline was seen on video moments before the door accident in no apparent distress, 2) the door slam was a significantly traumatic event, and 3) the death occurred at the time of the door slam, the Review Committee members [concluded] it is probable that the trauma of the accident triggered acute stress cardiomyopathy.\u201d\u00a0 Therefore, the Review Committee stated, \u201cMr. Ditterline\u2019s death should be charged to the mining industry.\u201d", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On January 5, 2019, at 3:53 a.m., Gary Quertermous, Mine Control, notified the Department of Labor National Contact Center of the accident.\u00a0 At 4:08 a.m., the Contact Center notified Robert Bretzman, Supervisory Mine Safety and Health (CMS&H) Inspector.\u00a0 Bretzman notified Mary Jo Bishop, Assistant District Manager for Enforcement, of the accident.\u00a0 He then directed Brandon Naas, CMS&H Inspector/Accident Investigator, to investigate the accident.\u00a0 Bretzman and Naas traveled to the mine where they met Bishop. \u00a0Naas issued a 103(k) order to protect the safety of persons at the mine.Investigators obtained preliminary interview statements from persons having knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident.\u00a0 The accident investigation team then traveled underground and arrived at the accident scene at approximately 11:20 a.m.\u00a0 They took photographs and measurements of the accident scene.MSHA conducted the investigation in cooperation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Mines and Minerals (IDNR), and Hamilton County Coal, LLC personnel. \u00a0See Appendix B for a list of those participating in the investigation.On January 7, 2019, David Brown, Training Specialist with MSHA\u2019s Educational Field & Small Mine Services (EFSMS), reviewed training records. \u00a0Bretzman and Naas conducted further testing on the pneumatic airlock doors after the stopping had been replaced.On January 8, 2019, Gary Rethage and Mark Kvitkovich, Mechanical Engineers with MSHA Technical Support, traveled to the mine with other investigators to mechanically evaluate the pneumatic airlock doors involved in the accident.On January 17, 2019, the accident investigation team conducted interviews at the IDNR building located in Benton, Illinois (see Appendix B).", "DISCUSSION": "Accident SceneThe accident occurred at the set of outby pneumatic airlock doors located on the East Main, Entry 4, between footage markers 0-100, just east of the Main Shaft bottom area (see Appendix A).\u00a0 When investigators arrived, the pneumatic doors involved in the accident were in the open position and the slide access door was open.\u00a0 Electrical power had been disconnected, locked, and tagged out.Pneumatic Airlock DoorsThe airlock consisted of a set of pneumatic-operated equipment doors (an outby set and an inby set) that allow equipment and personnel access between the mine and the shaft. \u00a0The outby airlock doors involved in the accident are located near the bottom of the shaft. The inby set of doors are one crosscut inby through an angled crosscut (see Appendix A).\u00a0 The doors were manufactured by Alliance Central Shop.\u00a0 The doors are made of metal and each door is approximately 7 feet wide by 7.3 feet high and weighs approximately 550 pounds.\u00a0 Both doors opened in the inby direction.\u00a0 One door of each set has a small slide access door which measured 29\u201d X 18.5\u201d.Pneumatic Door OverviewThere are two pneumatic systems at this airlock, one for the inby airlock doors, and the other for the outby airlock doors.\u00a0 Each pneumatic system is comprised of a compressor, air tank (accumulator), two pneumatic hoses with flow restriction valves in-line, and a pneumatic cylinder. \u00a0The cylinder rod connects via a bolted connection to the slide mechanism. \u00a0The slide mechanism, which rolls on a steel beam mounted to the roof of the entry, connects to the linkage bars via a pinned connection. \u00a0The linkage bars then connect to the doors with a pinned connection (see Appendix C).\u00a0The pneumatic cylinder is a double acting cylinder; it has a port on both sides of the cylinder to control motion for extension or retraction. \u00a0When the doors are closed, the cylinder rod is in the extended position. \u00a0The pneumatic air pressure is located on the piston side of the cylinder to keep the cylinder rod extended and the doors closed, while the air in the other side vents to the atmosphere. \u00a0The air venting to atmosphere works as a dampener to slow the pressurized side. \u00a0This allows the doors to open or close in a controlled manner. \u00a0The solenoids reverse when the doors go into the open status, pressurizing the rod side of the cylinder to retract the cylinder rod and venting the air on the piston side of the cylinder rod.An electronic system controls the pneumatic components. \u00a0This system utilizes an Allen Bradley MicroLogix 1400 Model, programmable logic controller (PLC), which controls the solenoid valves, lights, and audible alarms. \u00a0There are limit switches above the slider mechanism that sense the position of the cylinder rod. \u00a0The limit switches send a signal to the logic controller. \u00a0An electronic signal opens a solenoid and closes the other solenoid when the beam of the photo sensors is broken. \u00a0This also triggers the lights and audible alarms for the direction of travel.\u00a0The photo sensor has two sides: \u00a0open or close. \u00a0The open sensor is marked with green and the close sensor is marked with red. \u00a0The beam generator generates a beam; the beam reflects back to a sensor in the beam generator. \u00a0When the beam is broken, the PLC opens or closes the doors. \u00a0The PLC also activates the lights and audible alarms. \u00a0Miners operate the doors by placing their hand into the appropriate side of the photo sensor mount located near the doors (see Appendix D).The doors have three statuses: \u00a0closed, open and fault. \u00a0The fault condition activates when the doors do not reach the limit switch in the desired direction of travel within 35 seconds. \u00a0The pneumatics stay pressurized in the desired direction of travel while the air in the other side of the cylinder has had time to completely vent to the atmosphere. \u00a0The fault clears by interrupting the beam on both the open and close sides of the photo sensor mount. \u00a0The lights continue to flash in the fault condition, but the alarm stops after 35 seconds.Mechanical Engineers from MSHA Technical Support observed the outby doors and its components on January 8, 2019. \u00a0They evaluated the components of the pneumatic system for damage. \u00a0The investigators did not observe damage on any component of the system, including the pneumatic cylinder, cylinder rod, linkages, hoses, valves, air tank (accumulator), or door. \u00a0The electronic controls appeared to be functioning properly as the door functioned as designed when tested.\u00a0 Investigators did not observe damaged components in the pneumatic system or mechanical components. \u00a0The pneumatic system and all mechanical components operated as designed.Effects of Ventilation Pressures on the Pneumatic DoorsThe mine repaired the damaged stopping prior to the January 8 investigation to correct the ventilation. \u00a0The investigators observed that the outby doors opened normally with the corrected ventilation. \u00a0However, the inby doors would not open without assistance due to the ventilation change caused by the damaged stopping. \u00a0When mine personnel pushed on the inby doors, they opened in an uncontrolled rapid manner in the same way the outby doors opened, which caused the fatal injury.ReenactmentIn an attempt to recreate a fault condition on the outby doors, the investigators opened the sliding door on one of the inby doors to increase pressure and ventilation in the airlock.\u00a0 The investigators measured the velocity of the air in the airlock with an anemometer. \u00a0The air quantity was approximately 13,000 cubic feet per minute (cfm). \u00a0Before repairs were made to the damaged stopping, the quantity of the air in the airlock had been measured at approximately 36,000 cfm. \u00a0Despite the reduced ventilation pressure, the outby doors went into the fault condition and did not open without assistance.The system was set to the fault condition again to evaluate what would happen when the sliding door in one of the outby doors was opened. \u00a0After a few seconds, the outby doors opened in an uncontrolled rapid manner. \u00a0This test demonstrated the scenario that evidence indicates occurred at the time of the accident.\u00a0Mine personnel placed pressure gauges on both ports of the outby door cylinder to monitor pressures while the door was being tested.\u00a0 The air tank maintained a pressure of 140 pounds per square inch (psi).\u00a0 Testing was then performed on the cylinder while the door was in a fault condition.\u00a0 The rod side of the cylinder remained within its designed operating pressures of 105 to 120 psi.\u00a0 The piston side of the cylinder went to zero which means that there was no dampening effect to allow the doors to open in a controlled manner after the slide access door was open.\u00a0 Testing showed investigators that the pneumatic system operated as designed, that there were no overpressures or other problems solely with the pneumatic system, and that the problem with the doors was created by the high air pressure environment.Conclusions from TestingThe increased ventilation pressure due to the damaged stopping was outside the designed operating parameters for this system. \u00a0At the time of the accident, the airlock door system operated within its designed logic parameters and entered a fault condition when the door would not open. \u00a0When the victim opened the sliding door on the outby door, the ventilation pressure moved toward equilibrium. \u00a0The pneumatic air pressure on the rod side of the cylinder (pushing open the door) was now greater than the force provided by the ventilation pressure (holding the door closed). \u00a0The residual air pressure on the piston side of the cylinder that normally dampens this movement had completely vented to the atmosphere; this allowed the outby door to open in an uncontrolled rapid manner.Rethage and Technical Support\u2019s Mechanical Engineering Division calculated the kinetic energy and the energy equivalency of the pneumatic airlock door when it impacted Ditterline.\u00a0 They determined that the door hit Ditterline with the equivalent energy of a 550 pound mass moving at approximately 4.5 miles per hour.\u00a0 Ditterline was pinned between the door and the concrete barrier, with the door continually applying a force of 550 pounds until the door was moved away from him and closed.\u00a0 Video surveillance established that the outby airlock doors went into fault mode at 3:18 a.m., and the door was removed from Ditterline at 3:22 a.m.Problems with the Pneumatic Airlock DoorsInvestigators discovered through interviews and discussions with miners that the operation of the airlock doors was problematic and known to miners.\u00a0 Investigators also learned through the discussions with miners that the mine operator attempted to overcome the high mine ventilation pressure by installing an air compressor near the shaft bottom, in line with the air supply from the surface, to ensure air was always available for the airlock doors.\u00a0 This did not correct the problem.\u00a0 After installing the compressor, the airlock doors would open easier. \u00a0However, the slide access door still had to be opened for the airlock doors to operate, and the airlock doors would open more violently.\u00a0 Investigators also discovered that on the shift prior to the accident, a miner was nearly struck by the same set of airlock doors as the victim.\u00a0 However, mine management was not made aware of this incident.Investigators reviewed the mine surveillance video from earlier in the shift prior to the accident.\u00a0 This video shows Payne, who normally works in this area of the mine and is very familiar with these airlock doors, open the inby set of airlock doors and drive his megatrack pushing a supply trailer into the airlock.\u00a0 After closing the inby set, the video shows he activated the photo sensor to open the outby airlock doors involved in the accident.\u00a0 Although Payne cannot be seen on the video inside the airlock, the lights on the travelway indicate the airlock doors went into fault condition twice and did not open.\u00a0 Payne can be seen walking back through the inby set of airlock doors and around to the shaft bottom side of the outby set of doors. \u00a0By approaching the outby set of airlock doors from this side, he could open them standing out of the swing path while avoiding the sudden movement.ExaminationsInvestigators determined through interviews that the mine operator did not regularly conduct pre-shift examinations for supply travelways between the airlock doors.\u00a0 An adequate preshift examination may have identified the operational issues associated with the doors.Training and ExperienceDitterline had 28 years of total underground mining experience, with 5 weeks and 5 days as a contract laborer for Madisonville Mining, LLC at Hamilton County Coal.\u00a0 He had mine manager and mine examiner certifications from the State of Illinois. \u00a0He received experienced miner training on November 26, 2018.\u00a0 He had not received task training with regard to the hazards associated with the pneumatic airlock doors in fault condition.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \u00a0The accident investigation team identified root causes that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions that were implemented to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\u00a0 The pneumatic airlock doors were not designed and maintained to operate safely in the high mine ventilation pressure area near the shaft bottom.\u00a0 A damaged permanent ventilation stopping, which isolated the area between the airlock doors from the intake air course, caused the high mine ventilation pressure on the outby airlock doors.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator replaced the pneumatic system with a hydraulic system on the airlock doors that is capable of safely operating the doors in the high mine ventilation pressure area near the shaft bottom.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator had not established safe work procedures when miners encountered fault conditions on the pneumatic airlock doors.\nCorrective Action: \u00a0The mine operator developed and implemented safe work procedures to be followed in the event of fault conditions on pneumatic and hydraulic airlock doors.\u00a0 All miners were trained in these work procedures.Root Cause: \u00a0The mine operator did not task train the victim with regard to the hazards associated with the pneumatic airlock doors in fault condition.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 Miners have received task training on the safe operating procedures for the hydraulic equipment doors. \u00a0Also, the hydraulic equipment door operation instructions have become part of the mine operator\u2019s Standardized Traffic Rules.", "CONCLUSION": "On Saturday, January 5, 2019, at approximately 3:20 a.m., John D. Ditterline, a 55 year-old contract laborer, died when he was pinned between a pneumatic airlock door and a concrete barrier.\u00a0 The victim was tracing a power cable through the area of the airlock doors and he had passed through an inby set of airlock doors.\u00a0 When he tried to open the outby set of airlock doors, they failed to open.\u00a0 Evidence indicates that he then opened a small sliding access door at the bottom of one of the outby airlock doors.\u00a0 The opening of the sliding door lowered the air pressure and caused the outby airlock doors to suddenly spring open, pinning the victim between one of the outby airlock doors and a concrete barrier.The accident occurred because the mine operator did not design and maintain the pneumatic airlock doors to operate safely in the high air pressure environment where they were located, and did not establish safe work procedures for when the doors did not operate properly.\u00a0 A damaged, permanent ventilation stopping, isolating the area between the airlock doors from the intake air course, created additional pressure causing the doors to not open properly.\u00a0Approved By:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Ronald W.

Brown began his shift on December 29, 2018, at approximately 6:00 p.m. Ronald Coleman, Night Shift Supervisor, conducted a safety meeting with the night shift workcrew: Brown; Gregory Raley, Plant Operator; Mathew Rumley, Plant Operator; and Steven Strasser, Plant Operator. \u00a0Employees rotated positions every three to four hours during the shift, in accordance with Coalview\u2019s procedures. \u00a0Brown operated the suction dredge, Raley went to the control room, and Rumley and Strasser were the groundsmen for the first rotation.\u00a0\u00a0At approximately 6:30 p.m., after the safety meeting, Brown drove out to the impoundment, referred to as pond 3C (see Appendix A), to begin operating the suction dredge and relieve William Bachman, Plant Operator. \u00a0Bachman stated in his interview that when Brown relieved him, he told Brown that the walking surface of the starboard side of the stern pontoon was around one inch below the water surface. \u00a0Bachman released some tension on the stern-line and brought the pontoon up about four inches above the water line. \u00a0Bachman then left the suction dredge, but returned when he discovered that he left his portable radio. \u00a0Brown handed Bachman the radio and Bachman left the suction dredge.Approximately 6:53 p.m., Raley radioed Brown to relay flow information, and Brown told Raley that he was going to see clear water, because he was going to pump out the pontoon.\u00a0 The investigators found a portable bilge pump in the starboard compartment of the stern pontoon. (See Appendix B) \u00a0Based on the location of the portable pump, the investigators concluded that Brown intended to pump the stern pontoon.At approximately 7:14 p.m., Raley noticed that the output from the suction dredge had dropped off. He attempted to radio Brown, but received no response. At that time, Rumley and Strasser were checking a light plant near the power box for the suction dredge, Rumley noticed that the power indicator lights were not on. Strasser radioed Raley alerting him that there was no power to the dredge and that he could not see the dredge. At this time, Rumley traveled by boat to check on the dredge.When Rumley reached the location of the dredge, he found it had sunk with only the A-frame protruding out of the water. Rumley radioed Coleman, who notified Brian Casperson, Trans Alta\u2019s Shift Supervisor, and asked him to call for help. Coleman and Strasser also joined in the search for Brown by boat.Casperson called for emergency responders at 7:54 p.m.\u00a0 The fire department, law enforcement and emergency medical services arrived and continued to search for Brown.\u00a0 At approximately 10:28 p.m., rescuers halted search efforts because of the weather and poor visibility.\u00a0 The search resumed during the daylight hours on December 30, 2018. \u00a0Law enforcement officers called rescue divers from Thurston County, Washington.\u00a0 The rescue divers located Brown, who was wearing a flotation device, at approximately 2:35 p.m. in the dredge operator\u2019s compartment.\u00a0 The interviews with the divers revealed that they had a difficult time opening the dredge operator\u2019s compartment door.\u00a0 They recovered the victim and turned him over to the Lewis County Coroner for an autopsy.\u00a0 The medical examiner determined that the cause of death was from drowning.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On December 29, 2018, at 7:50 p.m., Roger Fish, Coalview\u2019s President, contacted the Department of Labor\u2019s National Contact Center (DOLNCC), to notify MSHA that a miner was unaccounted for and possibly trapped in a suction dredge. \u00a0DOLNCC notified Melvin Palmer, MSHA\u2019s Kent Field Office Supervisory Inspector, of the accident at 8:05 p.m. Palmer dispatched John Uriona, MSHA Inspector, to the mine and the investigation started the next day. \u00a0Upon arrival, Uriona issued an order under the Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to secure the scene and ensure the safety of the miners.MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident site, interviewed miners, and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident.\u00a0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and contractors.\u00a0 See Appendix C for persons participating in the investigation.Coalview took over two months to contract Global Diving and Salvage Inc., a maritime salvage company to recover the suction dredge. \u00a0The recovery process began on March 4, 2019. \u00a0They recovered the suction dredge and brought it to a prepared examination area on April 11, 2019.\u00a0 The recovery was hampered by the dredge being stuck in the several feet of coal slurry.Johnathan Hall, MSHA\u2019s Approval and Certification Center Mechanical Engineer, arrived on April 16, 2019, to begin assessment of the condition of the suction dredge. \u00a0Jordan Rose and Robert Bates, MSHA\u2019s Pittsburgh Safety and Health Technology Center Electrical Engineers arrived on April 30, 2019, to assess the electrical distribution system.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred in a coal refuse impoundment identified as pond 3C.\u00a0 The maximum depth of the pond is approximately 30 feet and investigators estimate the depth where the dredge sank was 21 feet.\u00a0Suction DredgeInvestigators were unable to determine the manufacturer and the year of manufacture of the suction dredge.\u00a0 There was a weld bead on the starboard side of the center hull section with the letters and numbers WB133MIF0493.\u00a0 This was the only identification marking on the suction dredge, and investigators were not able to track it or find any information on the dredge searching various databases.Coalview purchased the suction dredge in 2015, from Dredge Central of Goodlettsville, Tennessee. \u00a0It is approximately 72 feet long and 17 feet wide. \u00a0It consists of four sections with flotation: the starboard pontoon; the port pontoon; the stern pontoon; and the center hull (See Appendices B and D).\u00a0 The starboard and port pontoons had four sealed compartments each.\u00a0 The stern pontoon had two sealed compartments.\u00a0 The center hull does not seal. \u00a0Other major components include the cutter head assembly, the A-frame that supports the cutter head, and the dredge operator\u2019s compartment.When Coalview purchased the suction dredge, it was equipped with a diesel engine.\u00a0 At Coalview\u2019s request, Dredge Central replaced the diesel engine with four electric motors.\u00a0 Dredge Central also added the stern pontoon, the electrical transformer on top of the stern pontoon, and the Motor Control Center (MCC) on top of the stern end of the center hull. \u00a0Water was added to the first compartment on the starboard side pontoon to counter-balance the electrical transformer that was added to the portside stern pontoon when the suction dredge was modified from a diesel suction dredge, to an electrical suction dredge.\u00a0Coalview runs a 7200 volt power cable from the shore to the electrical transformer to provide power to the suction dredge.Suction Dredge OperationThe suction dredge does not have conventional vessel controls or a propeller.\u00a0 Three winches control the suction dredge location by reeling in or spooling out cables attached to anchor points on the shore.\u00a0 The stern winch is located at approximately the center of the stern pontoon, in an elevated position, and next to the transformer.\u00a0 The front starboard and port winches are mounted at the front of the dredge operator\u2019s compartment.The suction dredge recovers coal slurry from the bottom of the impoundment.\u00a0 The slurry is a mixture of water, coal fines, rock, and clay or dirt. \u00a0The cutting head is lowered into the water from the A frame by a winch. \u00a0The weight of the cutter head assembly caused the suction dredge trim to change.\u00a0 As the cutter head assembly lifts up, the bow (forward part of the hull) of the suction dredge lowers in the water and as the cutter head assembly lowers, the bow of the suction dredge lifts up and the stern of the suction dredge lowers into the water.\u00a0 Based on statements made during investigation interviews, investigators learned that portions of the deck were underwater, at times, during normal operation.A large slurry pump, powered by a 500 horsepower electric motor, pulls the material loosened by the cutting head into the inlet pipe. \u00a0The slurry pump pushes the slurry into a discharge pipe on the suction dredge.Suction Dredge ConditionPontoons & Compartments:Investigators conducted tests for leaks on nine of the ten pontoon compartments. \u00a0Damage sustained to the port side of the stern pontoon during recovery of the suction dredge made it impossible to test the port side compartment on the stern pontoon.\u00a0 The rubber seals on the ten hatch covers for the pontoon compartments were hardened and flat along the outer edges, preventing the hatches from getting a positive seal. Prior to testing, investigators removed a mixture of mud, coal slurry, rust, and water from each compartment. \u00a0Investigators filled the nine undamaged pontoon compartments with water and documented any leaks.Investigators determined that the first and fourth compartments on the starboard pontoon leaked. \u00a0A pipe with a valve that did not fully close allowed water to flow between the third and fourth compartments. \u00a0Pontoons should be kept independent of each other in case if one pontoon fails the other pontoons would continue to float.The number four compartment of the starboard pontoon had an area of deterioration on its bottom outside weld seam that measured 31 inches long.\u00a0 Within that 31 inches of affected area, there were two, approximately 6.5 inches long cracks, and an approximately 0.5 inch hole located between the cracks. \u00a0The hatch that secured the starboard compartment on the stern pontoon was missing. \u00a0Brown appears to have been pumping water from the starboard compartment using a portable electric sump pump, as investigators found the pump with electrical cord and discharge hose here.\u00a0 Testing did not reveal any leaks in this compartment. \u00a0The other nine hatches were in place and secured.\u00a0Bilge Pumps:Two of the three built-in, float-equipped bilge pumps in the center hull were missing. \u00a0The port and starboard bilge pumps on the bow end of the hull had been removed. \u00a0The third portside aft bilge pump was not functional. \u00a0Appendix B shows the three pumps with labels PF (Pump Forward), PL (Pump Left), and PR (Pump Right).Investigators identified a hose that connected the sump pump in the stern end of the hull to its outlet pipe that discharges outside of the hull and into the pond. \u00a0This pipe penetrated the stern end of the center hull 43 inches above the bottom. \u00a0Neither the pipe, the hose, nor the pump included a check valve.Equipment Changes:Coalview replaced the slurry pump that came with the suction dredge with a larger, heavier model. \u00a0This larger pump required reinforcement of the floor of the center hull to support it. \u00a0Coalview also replaced electric motors on the suction dredge multiple times after the hull had taken on enough water to submerge and destroy them.\u00a0 These changes added thousands of pounds of additional weight to the suction dredge. \u00a0Dredge Operator\u2019s Compartment Doors:The dredge operator\u2019s compartment had a metal door with windows on the starboard and port side. \u00a0The starboard door did not line up properly with the doorframe and the plunger of the doorknob did not engage the doorframe. \u00a0Opening and closing the starboard door required significant force. \u00a0On many occasions during the investigation, investigators had to make multiple attempts to open the starboard door to the dredge operator\u2019s compartment.\u00a0 The port side door lined up with the doorframe and the plunger of the knob engaged with the doorframe. \u00a0However, the plunger was badly worn and came apart during the investigation, and mine personnel reported that both doors routinely stuck closed.\u00a0 Coalview reportedly replaced the entire doorknob assembly about once a year. \u00a0There was a new replacement assembly on the floor of the dredge operator\u2019s compartment, unopened in the original packaging.Electrical:Based on the information gathered during the investigation and the data recorded by Trans Alta, an electrical fault occurred in the 7200 volt dredge circuit at 7:19 p.m. on the day of the accident. The fault was of sufficient magnitude and duration to cause the oil blast circuit breaker in Substation 6 to trip. \u00a0Vacuum circuit breaker 14, which is located in the switch house near the shore of the settling pond, did not trip during the event because the shunt trip mechanism had been disassembled.MSHA Mine Electrical Systems Division examined three short segments of Anaconda Brand 1/0 AWG, 8 KV, portable cable that supplied power to the dredge.\u00a0 Their examination found the outer jacket of these segments was damaged, and this damage had allowed water to enter into the interior of the cable.\u00a0 The damage extended into the insulation of one of the phases, but did not penetrate all the way to the copper conductor.\u00a0Daily InspectionsThe hazardous conditions that were found on the dredge, after it was recovered, were obvious and widespread.\u00a0 Also, management was aware of many of these conditions found on the dredge and continued to operate the dredge by using bilge pumps to remove water from the pontoons and hull. \u00a0Investigators discovered an electronic file that contained hazardous conditions observed during the mine operator\u2019s daily inspections.\u00a0 However, many of these hazardous conditions were not recorded in the preshift/on-shift daily report record book.WeatherThe weather conditions near the time of the accident were rainy and windy, with a temperature in the mid 40\u2019s. \u00a0The suction dredge operators from prior shifts reported \u201cbrown caps\u201d, or large waves in the pond.\u00a0Training and ExperienceCaleb J. Brown had 21 weeks of experience as a plant operator, all of which were at this mine. \u00a0On March 20, 2019, Heather Smith, MSHA\u2019s Educational Field and Small Mine Services Training Specialist, traveled to the mine and conducted an in-depth review of the mine operator's training records.\u00a0 The training records for Mr. Brown were in compliance with 30 CFR.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "The accident investigation team conducted a root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the accident.\u00a0 The team identified the following root causes and corresponding corrective actions implemented to prevent a recurrence of the accident.Root Cause: Mine management allowed several unsafe conditions to exist on the dredge.\u00a0 There were leaks in several compartments of the starboard pontoon. \u00a0Efforts to correct the leaks were unsuccessful, forcing miners to pump the pontoons and hull on a regular basis. \u00a0The combination of the water already in the starboard pontoon and hull, water entering through the open stern hatch and the stormy weather caused the dredge to sink.Corrective Action: The dredge has been taken out of service and is being evaluated for salvage / scrap value. The operator has submitted a new operating plan, which must be approved by the District Manager before any mining activities can resume.\u00a0Root Cause:\u00a0 Mine management did not correct hazards found during examinations.Corrective Action: The dredge has been taken out of service and is being evaluated for salvage / scrap value. The operator has submitted a new operating plan, which must be approved by the District Manager before any mining activities can resume.", "CONCLUSION": "Caleb J. Brown drowned after the suction dredge he was operating sank in an impoundment pond.\u00a0 The accident occurred because: the mine contractor did not have sufficient policies or procedures to maintain the suction dredge\u2019s pontoons, bilge pumps, and dredge operator\u2019s compartment doors to safely conduct mining operations; and the mine contractor conducted inadequate on shift examinations and took no action to correct hazardous conditions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Approved: ____________________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Date: _________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Donald R.

The MBC operated by Hostetter (victim) was outby the corner of the intersection in the No. 3 entry, between the conveyor belt and the left coal rib.\u00a0 Hostetter was located on the outby corner of the intersection in the No. 3 entry (see Appendix A).When Laue finished positioning the CMM cable, Lane used his cap light to signal to Hostetter that it was time to move again.\u00a0 Lane began to tram the MBC forward but heard a loud metallic noise and was unable to continue forward.\u00a0 Lane yelled for Hostetter and shut off his machine. \u00a0He yelled again and received no response.\u00a0 Lane could not see Hostetter, so he crawled back and saw him pinned between the No. 1 bridge conveyor frame and the coal rib.\u00a0 Lane trammed the No. 2 MBC back, and Hostetter fell to the mine floor.\u00a0 Lane pushed the panic button on the remote control transmitter to de-energize both MBCs, and yelled for Laue and Brian Francisco, Section Foreman and Emergency Medical Technician (EMT).Laue came from the CMM to the accident scene.\u00a0 Francisco was putting mining sights up in the No. 3 entry with Mike Scherer, Scoop Operator, when they both heard yelling and went to the accident scene.\u00a0 Other miners also heard yelling and went to the accident scene.\u00a0 Francisco assessed Hostetter\u2019s vitals and found no pulse or breathing.\u00a0 Francisco told the miners at the scene to call outside and tell Ernie Shaulis, Outside Attendant, to call 911 and then bring the first aid supplies and personnel carrier to the scene.\u00a0 Both Francisco and Scherer called Andrew Pianetti, Mine Examiner and EMT, who was working outby the section and told him to come to the section.Shaulis called 911 at 3:03 a.m. and then called Vincent Pelesky, Safety Supervisor, and Bradley Russian, Pennsylvania Bureau of Mine Safety (PA BMS) Inspector.\u00a0 Shaulis was contacted again from the miners underground and told to call for a helicopter.\u00a0 He called for a helicopter and then met the ambulance to show them where to land the helicopter.Hostetter was placed on the personnel carrier, which Laue drove to the surface while Pianetti and Scherer attempted to provide care to Hostetter.\u00a0 Pianetti and Scherer did not detect vital signs and were unable to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation because of the trauma sustained by the victim.\u00a0 When they arrived on the surface, both the Boswell Volunteer Fire Department and the Somerset ambulance services were waiting for them in the pit.\u00a0 The attendants from the ambulance service made the decision not to treat the victim any further.\u00a0 He was placed into an ambulance and transported to the helicopter landing area, where he was pronounced dead at 3:33 a.m. by Wallace Miller, Somerset County Coroner, via telephone.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On December 20, 2018, at 3:48 a.m., Vincent Pelesky, Safety Supervisor for the North Fork mine, notified the Department of Labor National Contact Center (DOL-NCC) of the accident.\u00a0 The DOL-NCC notified Randall Caramellino, MSHA District 2 Staff Assistant, at 4:01 a.m.\u00a0 Caramellino contacted Dennis Zeanchock, MSHA Johnstown Field Office Supervisor, at approximately 4:17 a.m.\u00a0 Zeanchock directed Gregory Bodenschatz, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector (CMI), and Richard Gindlesperger, CMI/Accident Investigator, to begin the accident investigation.\u00a0 Bodenschatz arrived at the mine at 5:20 a.m. and issued a 103(k) order to preserve the accident scene, prevent the destruction of evidence, and ensure the safety of all persons in the mine.MSHA personnel conducted the accident investigation in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mine Safety (PA BMS) and mine management.\u00a0 The investigation team conducted interviews with miners.\u00a0 See Appendix B for a list of persons interviewed and those participating in the accident investigation.The investigation team traveled underground and took pictures and measurements of the accident scene.\u00a0 The MBC system safety controls were tested on both MBCs and the remote control transmitters.\u00a0 During these preliminary tests investigators found no deficiencies.On December 21, 2018, Gindlesperger, Bodenschatz, along with representatives of PA BMS, and members of mine management traveled underground to conduct further testing of the safety functions on the MBCs and remote control transmitters.\u00a0 They conducted a re-creation of the accident and collected additional photos and measurements.\u00a0 The MBCs and the remote control transmitters functioned as designed during this testing.On December 26, 2018, Gindlesperger, Bodenschatz, Mark Gindlesperger, Deep Mine Inspector Supervisor, PA BMS, and members of mine management traveled underground to conduct function tests on the No. 1 MBC.\u00a0 The remote control transmitters for the No. 1 and No. 2 MBCs were taken into custody by MSHA for additional testing.On January 25, 2019, Structured Mining Systems Inc., (dba Cervis Inc.) performed functionality testing on the remote control transmitters at the Cervis facility in Cranberry, Pa.\u00a0 Both remote control transmitters functioned as designed.\u00a0 Investigators determined that both transmitters had several discrepancies when they were compared to the approval documentation on file at the MSHA Approval and Certification Center.\u00a0 The discrepancies did not contribute to the fatal accident.\u00a0 MSHA issued two non-contributory citations to Cervis Inc., one for each transmitter.", "DISCUSSION": "Accident SceneThe accident occurred 5 feet inby station spad 8487, in the No. 3 entry intersection of the 5 Right Room D section.\u00a0 The victim was on the right outby corner of the intersection in the No. 3 entry and the No. 1 MBC was outby the corner of the intersection in the No. 3 entry, between the conveyor belt and the left coal rib (see Appendix A).\u00a0 The area was mined 47 inches high.\u00a0 The roof had permanent roof support installed, and no hazardous conditions were observed in the roof and ribs in the area.\u00a0 The mine roof, ribs, and bottom were dry.\u00a0When the investigators arrived on the scene, the equipment was in the location that miners described during interviews. \u00a0Imprints of the MBC tracks, found on mine floor, were undisturbed and used to determine the location of the equipment at the time of the accident.Continuous Haulage Mining SystemThe continuous haulage mining system involved in the accident was a \u201cdetached system,\u201d meaning that the MBCs and bridge conveyors were not physically attached to the CMM.\u00a0 In addition, the MBCs did not have operator compartments and were remotely controlled.\u00a0 The continuous haulage system was a Fairchild[1], Model - Hi-Cap XL, Serial Number (SN) MBC 13-182, MSHA approval number 2G-3326A-7.\u00a0 The No. 2 (inby) MBC collects the mined coal from the rear of the CMM.\u00a0 A bridge conveyor connects the No. 2 MBC to the No. 1 (outby) MBC and another bridge conveyor connects the No. 1 MBC to the section conveyor belt (see Appendix A).The MBCs are operated separately by each MBC operator with a remote control transmitter from any location within radio frequency range, which can exceed 100 feet.\u00a0 The remote control transmitters used to control the MBCs were Structured Mining Systems Inc., remote control Model Number TX-H107. \u00a0Remote control transmitter SN 124 was used to operate the No. 1 MBC and remote control transmitter SN 129 was used to operate the No. 2 MBC.Each remote control transmitter has an \u201cinactivity shutdown\u201d function that shuts down the transmitter and the MBC if no switch on the transmitter is actuated within a set time.\u00a0 After the accident, the inactivity shutdown time was changed from 1 hour (set by the manufacturer) to 1 minute.CommunicationInvestigators learned that Lane commonly signaled with his cap lamp to inform Hostetter of his intentions to move forward or backward.\u00a0 This method of communication is unreliable because the view may be blocked and there is no confirmation that the MBC operator received or understood the signal.\u00a0 A positive means of verbal communication by radio or pager helps prevent miscommunication.Training and ExperienceHostetter had a total of 5 years, 21 weeks, and 4 days of underground mining experience, with 4 years and 26 weeks of experience as a MBC operator. \u00a0All of his experience was at the North Fork mine. \u00a0Hostetter had a certificate of qualification as a miner and a machine operator\u2019s certificate from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.On July 22, 2013, and on August 9, 2013, Hostetter was trained in the task of a continuous haulage operator on a Caterpillar (CAT) MBC.\u00a0 This training was conducted prior to the arrival of the Fairchild MBCs in January of 2014.\u00a0 Training records show that he did not receive additional training after the new system arrived.The new system differed from the CAT MBC being used earlier in that it has no attached operator\u2019s compartment or machine mounted controls, is not attached to the CMM, and is operated by remote control.\u00a0 Given the differences between the two MBC systems, the mine operator should have revised the training plan to address the differences, including any potential differences in hazards.\u00a0 Such a revision should have emphasized red zones and safe locations for the operators.Hostetter operated the Fairchild MBC for approximately 5 years before the accident and miners who were interviewed stated that he was proficient. \u00a0Hostetter also performed task training for other Fairchild MBC operators.\u00a0 Therefore, investigators do not believe inadequate task training was a contributing factor to the fatal accident.\u00a0 However, MSHA issued a noncontributing citation for a violation of 48.7(a)(3) because the victim was not tasked trained before he started operating the Fairchild MBC in 2014.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that are correctible through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective action which was implemented to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\u00a0 The operator did not provide adequate means of protection against crushing injuries to miners that operate the Fairchild MBC system.\n\u00a0Corrective Action:A proximity detection system is being installed on the MBC involved in the fatal accident.\u00a0 The other MBCs will be provided with either a proximity detection system or a substantially constructed deck.\n\t\u00a0\nAll decks on MBCs shall be substantially constructed to protect MBC operators from crushing injuries.\u00a0 All decks shall be provided with an operator-in-position safety device.\u00a0 This device will be installed to deactivate the tram motors of all MBCs when an MBC operator exits the compartment.\u00a0 The switch shall prevent restarting the motor of any MBC until the operator returns in position.\u00a0 This safety device shall be functional when repositioning during the mining cycle or tramming the MBC from one place to another.\n\t\u00a0\nThe mine operator will perform and document a pre-operational check which includes checking each operator-in-position switch (if an operator\u2019s deck is installed), panic bar, and proximity detection system (if operated by remote control) prior to putting the equipment into service each shift.\u00a0 All deficiencies found that affect safety must be corrected before any MBC is put into service.\u00a0 The pre-operational checks, deficiencies found, and corrective actions shall be documented in the foreman\u2019s note pad and made available to MSHA upon request and recorded in a book.\u00a0 The record book of the pre-operational checks shall be promptly dated and signed.\u00a0 The record book will be retained at a surface location at the mine for at least one year and shall be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners.\n\t\u00a0\nAll MBCs shall be provided with an audible alarm system that warns machine operators and other miners in the vicinity at least 3 seconds in advance that the machines are energized and able to move.\u00a0 Cap lamp signals will not be an acceptable means of warning.\n\t\u00a0\nThe inactivity shutdown feature on the remote control of each MBC will be reduced to a maximum of one minute.\u00a0 No miner shall operate more than one remote control box at the same time.\n\t\u00a0\nAll MBC operators have been provided with a stand-alone permissible two-way voice communications system.\u00a0 Such communication system shall be either hardwired on the machine or a wireless device worn by the machine operators.\u00a0 If a wireless device is used, a separate radio frequency specified for such use only shall be provided.\u00a0 MBC operators must receive a verbal confirmation from all other MBC operators prior to tramming.\n\t\u00a0\nSpecific Fairchild MBC operator training was added to the approved training plan.\u00a0 All Fairchild MBC operators have been trained accordingly.\n", "CONCLUSION": "On December 20, 2018, at approximately 3:00 a.m., Nevin Hostetter, a 35-year-old mobile bridge carrier operator with 5 years and 21 weeks of mining experience, was fatally injured when he was crushed between a bridge conveyor and a solid coal rib.\u00a0 The accident occurred when the mobile bridge system was being trammed toward a continuous mining machine (CMM).\u00a0 The accident occurred because the administrative and engineering controls and polices were not adequate to protect the victim from crushing injuries.\u00a0\u00a0_________________________

Edward Boylen, Birmingham Field Office Supervisor; Argus Brock, Roof Control Branch Supervisor; and Jarvis Westery, CMI/Accident Investigator.\u00a0 Westery was dispatched to the mine to begin the accident investigation.\u00a0 While Plumley, Boylen, and Westery were on their way to the mine, Harbin gathered preliminary information from mine personnel, examined the accident site, and monitored the recovery efforts. \u00a0While recovery efforts were taking place, additional material began falling from the highwall.\u00a0 As noted earlier, everyone was removed to a safe area until it was safe to resume recovery efforts.Leon Herren, Chief of Operations; and James R. West, Supervisor, both with the Alabama State Department of Labor (ADOL) were at the site to jointly conduct their accident investigation with MSHA.\u00a0 West arrived at about 3:00 p.m. and Herren arrived at about 4:00 p.m.Plumley and Boylen arrived at the mine at approximately 4:00 p.m., and Westery arrived at roughly 5:00 p.m.\u00a0 Plumley, Boylen, and Westery traveled to the accident site and were briefed by Harbin.\u00a0 Harbin, Boylen, and Herren remained at the accident site to monitor the recovery operations.\u00a0 Plumley, Westery, and West went to the mine office and conducted informal interviews with miners who might have information relevant to the accident.On December 12, 2018, Plumley, Westery, Brock, and West along with company officials and engineers continued the investigation.\u00a0 Engineers used a drone to map and evaluate the post-accident geological features of the entire length of the highwall.On December 13, 2018, formal interviews were conducted at the MSHA Birmingham Field Office in conjunction with ADOL.\u00a0 See Appendix A for a list of those who were interviewed.\u00a0 James Pfeifer, Senior Civil Engineer, and Rodi Murad, Civil Engineer, both with MSHA\u2019s Technical Support Mine Waste and Geotechnical Engineering Division (MWGED), arrived at the mine to continue the onsite investigation.", "DISCUSSION": "Mining ProcessThe typical mining sequence consists of removing spoil material from the rock strata, drilling into the rock strata, and blasting the overburden to a depth of approximately 4 feet above the coal seam.\u00a0 This leaves a highwall ranging in height from 63 to 80 feet.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, the highwall was approximately 3,000 linear feet long.\u00a0 In August 2018, the mine operator began the mining operations that created this highwall. \u00a0\u00a0General Machine InformationThe front-end loader involved in the accident had 4 forward gears and 4 reverse gears, with a maximum forward speed of 23 miles per hour (mph) and 26 mph in reverse.\u00a0 The loader had an operating weight of 54,963 pounds including the bucket.\u00a0 It was approximately 30 feet long and 12 feet wide.\u00a0 Although the loader frame was damaged by the highwall collapse, its engine was still operating when the machine was recovered from the rock.Accident LocationThe accident occurred near the base of the highwall on the northwestern area of the property.\u00a0 The entire highwall was oriented in a northeast direction.\u00a0 The area that failed was approximately 400 feet south of the northern end of the highwall.\u00a0 The face of the highwall was sloped away from the pit approximately 20 degrees at most locations; however, there was at least one location south of the failure area where the upper portion of the highwall was sloped toward the pit.\u00a0 There were no benches in the highwall.There was a geologic fault in the rock in the vicinity of the wall failure. \u00a0The coal bed was 12 inches thinner on the left side of the failure. \u00a0During the interview process, miners stated the fault had consistently existed in approximately the same location in previous pits. \u00a0This anomaly provides an indicator of deformities that extended to the highwall.\u00a0Accident Site GeologyThe strata above the coal seam generally consisted of 65 feet of shale and sandstone covered by about 20 feet of silty clay soil.\u00a0 At the accident area, most of the silty clay soil overlying the rock had been removed before the highwall collapse.The failed portion of the highwall was triangular in shape, approximately 120 feet wide along the face of the highwall, and extended into the highwall approximately 40 feet.\u00a0 Based on the dimensions of the failed area, investigators estimate that approximately 7,000 to 8,000 cubic yards of material failed.\u00a0 The pile of debris from the failure extended up to the top of the highwall and out from the base of the highwall approximately 100 feet.Multiple discontinuities (rock joints) were observed in the exposed face of the highwall adjacent to the area that failed (see Appendix B).\u00a0 The bearing of one set of rock joints was N64\u00b0E.\u00a0 This is 48\u00b0 off of the bearing of the highwall (N16\u00b0E).\u00a0 This joint set defined one leg of the triangular-shaped failure.\u00a0 The length of the failure area along this set of joints was approximately 90 feet.\u00a0 The spacing of this set of exposed highwall joints, immediately behind the area that failed, ranged from approximately 2 feet to 4.5 feet.\u00a0 The joints, and slabs of rock between the joints, were dipping 84.4\u00b0 NW such that the rock was leaning toward the pit.\u00a0 Joint openings were up to 3 inches and staining of the exposed faces of the intact rock was present.Investigators observed a second set of rock joints, with a bearing roughly perpendicular to the first set of joints (N37\u00b0W).\u00a0 This joint set defined the second leg of the failure triangle.\u00a0 The length of the failure area along this set of joints was approximately 60 feet.\u00a0 The dip of this set of rock joints was approximately 70\u00b0 NE such that the rock was leaning away from the pit (see Appendix C).Investigators observed conditions of the area above the highwall.\u00a0 The vegetation within approximately 150 feet of the crest had been removed and silty clay soils overlying the rock were evident.\u00a0 The soil was sloped down toward the crest of the highwall.\u00a0 Most of the soil in the vicinity of the failure had been removed by pushing it over the highwall.\u00a0 Less soil had been removed from the highwall in the area directly north and south of the failure.\u00a0 The area to the north of the failure had been drilled and loaded for blasting just prior to the failure.Several tension cracks were present in the remaining soil at the top of the highwall in the failure area.\u00a0 The tension cracks in the soil were roughly parallel to the highwall failure face and were up to approximately 2 inches wide.\u00a0 The tension crack nearest the crest of the highwall had clean edges and did not appear to be filled with soil.\u00a0 The tension cracks further from the top of the highwall appeared to be partially filled with soil.Factors in the highwall failure were the location and orientation of the joint sets in the rock mass relative to the orientation of the highwall along with possible weather-related factors discussed below.\u00a0 The rock joints and rock slabs with a bearing of N64\u00b0E were leaning slightly toward the pit.\u00a0 The rock joints with a bearing of N37\u00b0W provided a release (break) for the rock mass that was leaning toward the pit.\u00a0 The staining on the face of the remaining rock indicated that the openings were preexisting and not due to blast fracturing (see Appendix D).Ground Control PlanThe mine operator\u2019s GCP was acknowledged on October 2, 2015.\u00a0 It detailed the plan to be used to assure that highwalls were safely created and provided provisions to follow when hazardous conditions were found.\u00a0 The following provisions are specifically stated in the mine operator's GCP but were not being followed:Benches and Highwalls (page 3) - Minimum Bench Width: 100 feet; Maximum Spacing To and/or between Benches: 50 feet.\n\t\u00a0\nGeneral Precautions (page 5, item 6) - Eliminating hazards from isolated individual rocks falling from a highwall will be accomplished through a combination of four (4) techniques: supporting or controlling the fall path of potentially loose rock, scaling the loose rock, providing rock catching benches or berms or both, and limiting the exposure of workers to areas where loose rock is present on the highwall.\n\t\u00a0\nGeneral Precautions (page 5, item 7) - If stress cracks exist or stability failure occurs in any portion of the highwall, operations in the affected area will be immediately revised.\u00a0 The revision will identify the reason for changes to the plan and will alert MSHA of the conditions resulting in the changes.\n\t\u00a0\nGeneral Precautions (page 6, item 12) - When failure to control the developing highwall occurs, such as the existence of overhangs, loose material, unconsolidated rocks, material falling into the pit, movement in the wall, or blasting practices fail to result in a clean and stable highwall, and corrective action cannot be taken to eliminate the existence of these conditions, the affected area will be barricaded to prevent persons from being exposed to the conditions and the plan will be revised to safely control the highwall and provide for safe conditions.\nInterview testimony indicated that management witnessed hazardous highwall conditions, such as stress cracks and poor stability, in the same general area of the accident in the previously developed highwall.\u00a0 The unsafe conditions served as a warning to management that the same or similar conditions may occur in future highwalls.\u00a0 The previously observed hazardous highwall conditions did occur in the highwall involved in the accident, but management did not utilize appropriate safety measures to abate these hazards or barricade areas off to prevent miners\u2019 exposure.\u00a0 These safety methods are clearly spelled out in the mine\u2019s GCP, and were not used.Weather ConditionsWeather can be a factor in highwall stability and may have been a factor in the failure of this highwall.Water was not observed seeping from the highwall in the area of the failure, however, two days before the accident about 3-inches of rain fell within a 24 hour timeframe.\u00a0 With numerous rock joints in the highwall, it is probable that some of the joints filled with water.\u00a0 On the day before the accident, the temperature was below freezing for about 10 hours.\u00a0 Freezing temperatures may have caused the water that may have been present in the rock joints to freeze and expand.\u00a0 The expanding water in the rock joints would have increased the horizontal forces on the slabs of rock between the rock joints, pushing the rock mass towards the pit.\u00a0 On the day and at the time of the accident, the temperature was 47\u00b0F with no rain.As required by 30 CFR \u00a7 77.1004(a), highwalls, banks, benches, and terrain sloping into the working areas shall be examined after every rain, freeze, or thaw before miners work in such areas.\u00a0 These examinations are to be made and recorded in accordance with 30 CFR \u00a7 77.1713.\u00a0Daily InspectionsThe daily inspection record for December 11, 2018, was made after the failure and noted that the highwall had fallen.\u00a0 Records of the daily inspections conducted for eight day shifts before the accident indicated that the highwall was \u201cok at this time.\u201d\u00a0 The eight previous daily inspections conducted for the second shifts indicated the highwall was \u201cstable.\u201dThere were multiple noticeable discontinuities (rock joints) observed in the exposed face of the highwall adjacent to the area that failed and tension cracks in the soil roughly parallel to the highwall (see Appendix B).\u00a0 Along its entire 3,000 linear feet of highwall, the highwall was greater than 50 feet high and no safety benches were constructed.\u00a0 The GCP required a minimum 100-foot-wide bench be constructed for every 50 feet in highwall height.\u00a0 For over three months, the mine operator developed the highwall in a manner that violated the provisions of the GCP.The hazardous conditions in the highwall, and the violations of the GCP, were obvious and widespread. \u00a0The daily inspections performed by the mine operator were inadequate.Training and ExperienceOn December 17, 2018, Brett Calzaretta, MSHA Educational Field and Small Mine Services (EFSMS) Training Specialist, and Westery checked company training records at the mine office.Cook had 14 years of experience working at this mine.\u00a0 On March 3, 2018, Cook received annual refresher training and experienced miner training, which included hazard training for this mine and other mine sites.\u00a0 Task training was conducted on July 18, 2017 at this mine site for operation of the Caterpillar 972G front-end loader.\u00a0 The training records were completed in accordance with the requirements of 30 CFR Part 48.In the interview process of the investigation, it became obvious to investigators that the foremen, the safety director, and the interviewed miners were not knowledgeable of key provisions of the GCP.\u00a0 Consequently, training as required by the mine\u2019s approved Training Plan was found to be ineffective and/or inadequate.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions which were implemented to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not conduct adequate daily inspections of the mine in that it did not recognize hazardous highwall conditions.\u00a0 Failure to identify and correct the hazardous highwall conditions allowed miners to be assigned to work in close proximity to the hazardous highwall.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 All mine foremen were trained on February 11, 2019, regarding proper daily inspections and hazard recognition pertaining to surface mining.\u00a0 The mine operator provided documentation of the training and the attendees.\u00a0 MSHA monitored the training.\u00a0Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not follow several provisions of the mine\u2019s GCP.\u00a0 The mine operator did not ensure that the miners were knowledgeable in the provisions of the mine\u2019s GCP.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator submitted a revised GCP which was reviewed and acknowledged by the District on January 23, 2019.\u00a0 The revision enhances safety by requiring, at all times, a 60-foot distance between the highwall and mobile equipment operators.\u00a0 Blasting will remove 180 feet from the pit and mobile equipment operators will only excavate 120 feet of blasted material, leaving a 60-foot buffer between them and the highwall.\u00a0 The mine operator trained all employees on the mine\u2019s GCP on January 28, 2019, and provided documentation of the training and the attendees.", "CONCLUSION": "On Tuesday, December 11, 2018, at approximately 2:07 p.m., Micky Cook, a 38-year-old surface miner with 14 years of mining experience was fatally injured when a large portion of a highwall (approximately 7,000 to 8,000 cubic yards) toppled.\u00a0 This caused rock to crush the operator\u2019s cab of the front-end loader he was operating.\u00a0 Cook was operating the front-end loader to remove blasted material near the base of a 63-foot highwall.The accident occurred because the mine operator did not conduct adequate daily examinations to identify hazardous highwall conditions and correct such hazards before allowing miners to work near the base of the highwall.\u00a0 Additionally, the mine operator did not follow safety provisions of the mine\u2019s Ground Control Plan (GCP).\u00a0 If implemented, these GCP requirements would have caused several safety measures to be initiated to eliminate hazardous highwall conditions.\u00a0 In addition, the mine operator did not adequately train miners regarding the safety provisions of the mine\u2019s GCP.\u00a0______________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

DateDistrict Manager", "\u00a0": "", "ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS": "Order No. 9132943 was issued to Cedar Lake Mining, Inc. on December 11, 2018, under the provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act:On December 11, 2018 at approximately 13:55, a fatal accident occurred from a fall of the highwall in the east end of the pit.\u00a0 The victim was operating a model 972G Caterpillar front end loader, serial no. 4WW00619, in the pit pushing up rock to be loaded out of the pit.\u00a0 A part of the highwall collapsed crushing the cab of the front end loader where the victim was located.\u00a0 This order is hereby issued to ensure the safety and health of the miners including those involved in rescue and recovery operations or investigation of the accident.\u00a0 The mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an Authorized Representative of the Secretary for all actions to recover and/restore operations in the affected area.\u00a0 Additionally, the mine operator is reminded of its existing obligations to prevent the destruction of evidence that would aid in investigation the cause of the accident.104(d)(1) Citation No. 9132944 was issued to Cedar Lake Mining, Inc. for violation of 30 CFR \u00a777.1000:On December 11, 2018, a Caterpillar 972G (Serial Number 4WW00619) front-end loader was operating near the base of a 63-foot high highwall to remove blasted material.\u00a0 A large portion of the highwall (approximately 7,000 \u2013 8,000 cubic yards of material) toppled onto the front-end loader, crushing the operator\u2019s cab and fatally injuring the miner.\u00a0 As a result of the fatal accident investigation, it is concluded that the mine operator did not comply with the provisions of the Ground Control Plan (GCP), acknowledged October 2, 2015 in the following manner:The surface mine highwall ranged in height from 63 to 80 feet over a linear distance of approximately 3,000 feet with no safety bench installed.\u00a0 The highwall at the site of the accident was 63 feet in height with no safety bench in place.\u00a0 Page 3 of the GCP requires a minimum 100 feet wide safety bench to be maintained at a maximum spacing to and/or between benches of 50 feet.\u00a0 The highwall at the site of the accident was 63 feet in height with no safety bench in place.\n\t\u00a0\nThe top of the surface mine highwall had loose, unconsolidated rock and material in numerous and extensive locations over a linear distance of approximately 3,000 feet with no adequate corrective measures implemented to eliminate the hazard. \u00a0Page 3, Item 6 of the GCP specifies that eliminating hazards from isolated individual rocks falling from a highwall will be accomplished through a combination of four (4) techniques: supporting or controlling the fall path of potentially loose rock, scaling the loose rock, providing rock catching benches or berms or both, and limiting the exposure of workers to areas where loose rock is present on the highwall.\n\t\u00a0\nEffective measures were not taken to eliminate the hazards of stress cracks which had developed in the highwall at the immediate location of the accident and in multiple locations along the linear distance of 3,000 feet of highwall. \u00a0Page 5, item 7 of the GCP specifies that if stress cracks exist or stability failure occurs in any portion of the highwall, operations in the affected area will be immediately stopped, the affected area will be barricaded and the GCP will be immediately revised.\u00a0 The revision will identify the reason for changes to the plan and will alert MSHA of the conditions resulting in the changes.\n\t\u00a0\nEffective measures were not taken to control, correct or barricade adverse areas of the highwall at the immediate location of the accident. \u00a0Page 6, item 12 of the GCP requires that when failure to control the developing highwall occurs, such as the existence of overhangs, loose material, unconsolidated rocks, material falling into the pit, movement in the wall, or blasting practices fail to result in a clean and stable highwall, and corrective action cannot be taken to eliminate the existence of these conditions, the affected area will be barricaded to prevent persons from being exposed to the conditions and the plan will be revised to safely control the highwall and provided for safe conditions.\nFor over three months, the mine operator developed the highwall in a manner that violated the provisions of the GCP.\u00a0 Also, management witnessed hazardous highwall conditions, such as stress cracks and poor stability, in the same general area of the accident in the previously developed highwall.\u00a0 The previous unsafe conditions served as a warning but management did not utilize appropriate safety measures to abate these hazards or barricade areas off to prevent miners\u2019 exposure.\u00a0 This violation is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory standard.104(a) Citation No. 9132945 was issued to Cedar Lake Mining, Inc. for violation of 30 CFR \u00a777.1713(a):On December 11, 2018, a Caterpillar 972G (Serial Number 4WW00619) front-end loader was operating near the base of a 63-foot high highwall to remove blasted material.\u00a0 A large portion of the highwall (approximately 7,000 \u2013 8,000 cubic yards of material) toppled onto the front-end loader, crushing the operator\u2019s cab and fatally injuring the miner.\u00a0 Evidence obtained through the fatal accident investigation revealed the first and second shift mine examiners performed inadequate daily inspections by failing to identify, report and correct the following violations of the Ground Control Plan (GCP) and hazardous highwall conditions:The immediate highwall at the site of the accident was 63 to 80 feet in height with no safety bench in place for approximately 3,000 linear feet.\n\t\u00a0\nThe top of the surface mine highwall had loose, unconsolidated rock and material in numerous and extensive locations over a linear distance of 3,000 feet with no adequate corrective measures implemented to eliminate the hazard.\n\t\u00a0\nEffective measures were not taken to eliminate the hazards of stress cracks which had developed in the highwall at the immediate location of the accident and in multiple locations along the linear distance of 3,000 feet of highwall.\n\t\u00a0\nEffective measures were not taken to control, correct or barricade adverse areas of the highwall at the immediate location of the accident.\nThe hazardous conditions in the highwall, and the violations of the GCP, were obvious and widespread.\u00a0 Also, management witnessed hazardous highwall conditions, such as stress cracks and poor stability, in the same general area of the accident in the previously developed highwall.\u00a0 The previous unsafe conditions served as a warning but management did not utilize appropriate safety measures to abate these hazards or barricade areas off to prevent miners\u2019 exposure.The mine operator has engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence by failing to recognize and record these violations and hazardous conditions and take corrective actions.\u00a0 This violation is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory standard.104(a) Citation No. 9132946 was issued to Cedar Lake Mining,

\u00a0Ney told Morgan to start the truck and he looked inside the hydraulic compartment.\u00a0 Morgan told Ney he was going to turn off the truck because exhaust fumes were accumulating where Ney was standing.\u00a0 Morgan heard a pop just before he turned off the truck.\u00a0 He walked to the rear of the truck and saw Ney laying on the floor with an injury above his right eye.Seasock returned to the garage moments later and Morgan told him to call 911.\u00a0 The 911 operator asked Morgan and Seasock to remove the coveralls from Ney and stay with him until the ambulance arrived.\u00a0 An ambulance transported Ney to the Shenandoah, Pennsylvania baseball field, where he was transported by helicopter to Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, Pennsylvania.\u00a0 He remained there until he died on December 30, 2018.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On November 29, 2018, at 1:36 p.m., Morgan notified the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center of the accident.\u00a0 The contact center notified Timothy Horton, District 2 Office Assistant.\u00a0 Patrick Boylan, Frackville Field Office Supervisor, dispatched Thomas Leshko, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Accident Investigator, to the mine.\u00a0 Leshko arrived at the facility at approximately 2:05 p.m. and issued a 103(k) order to ensure the safety of all persons at the mine.Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) personnel conducted the accident investigation in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mine Safety (PA BMS) and company personnel.\u00a0 The investigators conducted interviews with miners and photographed the accident scene.\u00a0 Jonathan Hall, Mechanical Engineer with Technical Support, conducted an investigation of the hydraulic system on the truck on November 30, 2018.\u00a0 See Appendix A for a list of persons interviewed and those participating in the accident investigation.", "DISCUSSION": "Truck and Hydraulic InformationThe service truck involved in the accident was a 2009 Ford F-550 purchased by the mine operator in September 2018. \u00a0The truck was equipped with a power take off hydraulic pump, a Stellar 6620 crane, and outriggers. \u00a0The truck also had a hose reel containing hydraulic hoses and a hydraulic cooling radiator, which were used for external hydraulic tools.An \u201con-off\u201d switch on a panel near the rear of the truck controlled whether hydraulic pressure was directed to the hose reel or the crane. \u00a0The \u201con\u201d position typically sent up to 200 psi to the reel while the \u201coff\u201d position sent up to 3,000 psi to the crane (see Appendix B).\u00a0 On the day of the accident, Morgan had modified the hydraulic system to direct 3,000 psi to the reel instead of the typical 200 psi when the switch was in the \u201con\u201d position.\u00a0 He told investigators that he modified the hydraulic system to remove components that were not needed for operation of the crane. \u00a0The hydraulic reel circuit included a brass compression fitting that held a temperature sensor (see Appendix C).\u00a0 The fitting had a maximum rating of 800 psi which is significantly less than the 3,000 psi it was subjected to after Morgan modified the hydraulic system.\u00a0 Ney was examining this area at the time of the accident (see Appendix D).Likely ScenarioBased on a review of the evidence, inspectors believe it is most likely that Ney turned the on-off switch partially to the \u201con\u201d position while examining the hydraulic system at close range. \u00a0This would have directed excessive pressure to the hydraulic reel, causing the temperature sensor to burst from the fitting and strike the victim in the head.Once the victim was struck, the switch was released, causing it to move back to the \u201coff\u201d position.\u00a0 A small amount of hydraulic fluid was found after the accident.\u00a0 If the switch remained in the \u201con\u201d position after the victim was struck, hydraulic fluid would have continued to be pumped out of the fitting.\u00a0Training and ExperienceGeorge Ney had 29 years of mining experience at this mine.\u00a0 Ney\u2019s most recent annual refresher training was received on August 29, 2018.\u00a0 He had no task training on the Ford F-550 truck or the hydraulic system located on the truck.\u00a0 Task training should have included instruction in the safety and health aspects and safe work procedures of the hydraulic system.\u00a0 No course material, or operator\u2019s manual, was provided for training the miners to recognize and avoid hazards associated with the hydraulic system.Morgan was also not trained in the hydraulic system.\u00a0 He was unaware of the effect of the changes he made to the hydraulic system.\u00a0 The mine operator should have ensured that Morgan, Ney, and Seasock were properly trained, and that the hydraulic system was depressurized, before Morgan modified the hydraulic system and asked Ney to work on it.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \u00a0A root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective action that was implemented to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not provide adequate task training on the hydraulic system on the truck before miners performed work on the hydraulic system.\nCorrective Action: \u00a0The mine operator developed new task training incorporating best practices.\u00a0 The operator provided new task training to miners who maintain and/or repair hydraulic systems.\u00a0 This training included safe work procedures when working on hydraulic systems, with instruction to not pressurize hydraulic systems prior to the completion of repairs.\u00a0", "CONCLUSION": "On Thursday, November 29, 2018, at approximately 1:05 p.m., George Ney, a 50-year-old mechanic with 29 years of mining experience received a critical injury while examining the hydraulic system on a service truck.\u00a0 The hydraulic system had been modified earlier that day, causing excessive pressure to flow to a fitting that burst, propelling a temperature sensor into his forehead. The victim died of his injuries on December 30, 2018.The accident occurred because Ney and other miners were not trained in safe procedures for working on the hydraulic system.\u00a0_________________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 _________________Russell J.

Mercord and Baller then loaded a roll of conveyor belt onto the tractor-trailer.\u00a0At 2:15 p.m., Baller left the Meadows Saw Shop in the tractor-trailer to proceed to McGregor.\u00a0 Baller arrived at McGregor at 2:30 p.m. and parked the tractor-trailer on the truck loop, leaving it idling. \u00a0He walked 3/10 of a mile up the haul road to get Truck 103, a Volvo A30C articulated haul truck and was unaware the truck\u2019s retarder system did not work.\u00a0 The grade of the winding haul road ranged from 10.5% to 21%, with an average grade of 14%.\u00a0 Baller drove the haul truck down the hill, negotiating several curves, but failed to make the final turn.\u00a0 The truck ran through a berm and travelled 39 feet through the air before hitting the ground 12 feet below.\u00a0 After impact, the haul truck rolled forward 49 feet uphill and then rolled backwards 84 feet downhill. \u00a0The rear tires travelled up a berm and caused the dump bed to fall on its side while the cab remained upright.\u00a0At approximately 9:15 p.m., Mercord saw that he had a voicemail message from Baller\u2019s wife.\u00a0 Mercord called Baller\u2019s wife and found out Baller had not come home.\u00a0 Mercord then called Ben Henshaw, Quarry Manager for Montana Rockworks, Inc., to meet him at McGregor.\u00a0 Mercord travelled to McGregor, arriving around 10:00 p.m., and found the damaged haul truck.\u00a0 Mercord climbed up on the side of the haul truck and found Baller inside, unresponsive, suffering from extensive injuries, and not wearing a seatbelt.\u00a0 At 10:15 p.m., Henshaw arrived and Mercord and Henshaw drove to the top of the haul road due to poor cell reception and called 911.\u00a0 At 10:30 p.m., the two men went down the hill and drove to McGregor Lake Lodge to escort Emergency Medical Services personnel to the scene.\u00a0 Baller was pronounced dead at the scene at 11:58 p.m.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "Brad Mercord called the Department of Labor National Contact Center (DOLNCC) at 11:45 p.m. on October 19, 2018, and notified MSHA of the accident. \u00a0DOLNCC notified Sidney Garay, Supervisory Inspector in MSHA\u2019s Rocky Mountain District. \u00a0MSHA issued an order under provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to ensure the safety of the miners and began the investigation.\u00a0MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team travelled to the mine, conducted a physical examination of the accident, interviewed miners, and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident. \u00a0MSHA\u2019s Technical Support also assisted in examining and conducting tests on the haul truck. \u00a0MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, miners and their representatives, Montana Safety and Health Bureau, and the Marion Police Department and Marion Fire Department.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred near the lower landing of the haul road that leads from the saw shop staging area.\u00a0 The overall road is approximately 18 feet wide and 3/10 of a mile long, and varies in grade from 10.5% to 21%, with an average grade of approximately 14%.WeatherWeather reports on the day of the accident indicated mostly clear, sunny, with a high of 63\u00b0F. Investigators did not consider weather as a factor in the accident.Articulated Haul TruckThe haul truck involved in the accident was an unloaded Volvo A30C, a six-wheel articulated haul truck.\u00a0 It had one drive axle on the tractor (tractor axle) and two drive axles on the trailer (front and rear bogie axles).\u00a0 Product information indicated the haul truck had an overall width of 9 feet 7 \u00bd inches and an empty weight of approximately 44,755 pounds.\u00a0General Condition of the Haul TruckThe trailer of the haul truck overturned during the accident, but the tractor remained upright.\u00a0 The haul truck sustained damage to the underside of the front of the tractor, the cab interior and the right side trailer tire and rim assemblies.\u00a0 The operator righted the trailer and towed the haul truck a short distance so MSHA Technical Support, with the assistance of mine maintenance personnel, could conduct a field inspection of the haul truck.\u00a0 The accident damaged the engine oil pan assembly which caused the engine oil to drain out. Therefore, investigators were unable to operate the engine during the inspection.Transmission and Drivetrain DesignThe haul truck had an automatic transmission with 6 forward speeds, 2 reverse speeds, and a neutral position.\u00a0 The transmission also had an integral hydraulic retarder.\u00a0 There are 4 driver-selected transmission control positions in the forward direction:\u00a0 D, 3, 2 and 1.\u00a0 Investigators found the transmission\u2019s gear selector lever in the \u201cD\u201d position.\u00a0 In this position, the transmission automatically shifts through the forward gears and allows the haul truck to travel at maximum speed.\u00a0 Product information indicates the maximum machine speed on level ground is approximately 32 \u00bd MPH.The haul truck can operate in 4-wheel drive, 6-wheel drive, and full 6-wheel drive (all longitudinal and transverse differentials locked for maximum traction force).\u00a0 Operating the haul truck in full 6-wheel drive can adversely affect the steering of the truck. \u00a0Investigators could not determine the haul truck\u2019s operating mode at the time of the accident because modes can change when electrical power or air system pressure is lost. \u00a0However, they found the haul truck was unable to operate in the full 6-wheel drive mode because the floor button in the cab had been disconnected, indicating the drive mode was not a factor in the accident.All of the drivetrain components were visibly intact and all 6 wheels rotated freely while towing the haul truck with the parking brake released.Service Brake and Parking Brake SystemsThe haul truck has an air-over-hydraulic service brake system with two air circuits \u2013 one for the tractor service brakes and one for the trailer service brakes. An engine-driven air compressor maintains air pressure. Actuators convert air pressure to hydraulic pressure to apply the disc brakes when the foot pedal is depressed.In order to test the haul truck\u2019s service brake system, investigators used a remote air supply from a truck tractor in lieu of the haul truck\u2019s air compressor.Investigators encountered two defects: The left side tractor service brake could not be locked on level ground with the truck bed empty; and overstroke sensors, which indicate when hydraulic pressure is low, were disconnected.\u00a0 However, investigators determined that these defects did not contribute to the accident. Five of the six service brakes were still capable of skidding the tires in the accident area, and no conditions were found that would have triggered the overstroke sensors.The haul truck has an air release parking brake system.\u00a0 To help control a moving haul truck in the event of an emergency, the parking brake design allows the truck driver to apply the parking brake while the truck is moving.\u00a0 Investigators tested the parking brake and found that it was capable of skidding four of the six tires of the empty truck, as designed. However, the parking brake control was found in the release position and there was no indication it had been applied during the descent.\u00a0Exhaust Brake SystemInvestigators found that the haul truck\u2019s exhaust brake switch had been set to the \u201carm\u201d or activate position. In that position, the exhaust brake would apply when the driver released the accelerator pedal to the idle position.Investigators were unable to test the performance of the exhaust brake system due to damage incurred during the accident, but they conducted tests on some components of the control circuit for the system.\u00a0 The components tested were functional, including the spring return feature of the accelerator foot pedal. Investigators did not identify any defects that would have prevented the exhaust brake from functioning while the truck descended the haul road if the transmission was in gear and the truck driver released the accelerator pedal.Retarder SystemThe haul truck is also equipped with a hydraulic transmission retarder, which acts inside the transmission to slow the truck when an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) determines certain operational conditions exist. It is activated in three ways: 1) by applying a foot pedal mounted on the left side floor of the cab; 2) by applying the service brake when the retarder switch on the dash has been turned on; or 3) automatically when the transmission reaches 6th gear and the engine surpasses 2,400 RPM. Regardless of how the transmission retarder is activated, it can only function when the MA8 air valve is opened by the ECU.\u00a0Investigators were not able to test the performance of the retarder system due to damage to the truck, but they did test some components of the system\u2019s control circuit.\u00a0Investigators encountered the following defects with the retarder system:\u00a0 the inability of a solenoid to correctly control the MA8 air valve made all three methods of applying the transmission retarder ineffective; and a defective SE56 switch that would not allow the ECU to recognize that the truck driver was pushing the retarder pedal, making that option ineffective even if the MA8 air valve operated properly.\u00a0 The defects in the Retarder System contributed to the accident.Steering SystemThe haul truck had an articulated steering system that used mechanical linkages to actuate a hydraulic steering control valve which then modulated two hydraulic cylinders, one on each side of the haul truck\u2019s articulation joint.\u00a0 A series of engine driven pumps provided hydraulic pressure to the steering valve.\u00a0 In addition to providing approximately 45 degrees of steering in either direction, the articulation joint arrangement had an oscillating hitch.\u00a0 This allowed complete independence of tractor rotation on the longitudinal axis, theoretically allowing the tractor to rotate 360 degrees with respect to the trailer.\u00a0 The steering wheel used mechanical linkage to provide steering inputs to the hydraulic steering valve mounted beneath the rear portion of the haul truck\u2019s cab.\u00a0 The trailer also used mechanical linkage to provide position feedback of the trailer to the steering valve.\u00a0 The trailer position feedback linkage caused the steering valve to automatically adjust to certain operating conditions to minimize driver workload.All of the mechanical steering linkages for the steering assembly and the hydraulic lines from the steering valve to the steering cylinders were visibly intact.\u00a0 Manual cycling of the steering wheel verified the spool valve for the hydraulic steering valve appropriately modulated with the steering wheel without sticking or binding with the engine off.The haul truck also had a secondary steering pump in the event the primary steering system\u2019s pumps failed to supply adequate pressure and flow.\u00a0 The secondary steering pump is ground driven and the haul truck needs to move at least 2 miles per hour in the forward direction for it to operate properly.Due to the inability to run the haul truck engine, investigators could not test either the primary or secondary steering pumps for adequate pressure and flow nor could they test the hydraulic functions of the steering valve itself while on the haul truck.\u00a0 Investigators did not conduct bench tests of these components.Suspension SystemAll of the haul truck\u2019s suspension components were visibly intact.Seatbelt AssemblyThe operator\u2019s seat had a self-retracting lap type seat belt assembly.\u00a0 Both the latching mechanism and the self-retracting feature of the seat belt assembly functioned when tested. However, the seatbelt was not in use at the time of the accident, contributing to the severity of the operator\u2019s injuries.Pre-operational Inspections of Haul TruckInvestigators reviewed the pre-operational inspection books for the haul truck.\u00a0 The transmission retarder pedal was documented as non-functional in 23 pre-operational inspections since August 9, 2018, but the truck continued to be used for over 260 hours.\u00a0 No documentation of a pre-operational inspection was found for the day of the accident.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE": "Jerry Baller worked at this mine for 17 years and 26 weeks. \u00a0A representative of MSHA\u2019s Educational Field and Small Mine Services (EFSMS) staff conducted a review of the operator\u2019s training plan and records. \u00a0EFSMS determined Mr. Baller received all required training, including annual refresher training according to 30 CFR Part 46.Investigators reviewed company policies and procedures in relation to the work being performed. The operator had inadequate policies in place at the time of the accident to address removing equipment from service when a safety defect is found.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "The accident investigation team conducted a root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the accident. The team identified the following root causes and the corresponding corrective actions implemented to prevent a recurrence of the accident.Root Cause:\u00a0 Management did not have policies, procedures, and controls for removing equipment from service when a defect affecting safety is found.Corrective Action:\u00a0 The Company developed policies and procedures for removing equipment from service when a defect is found.\u00a0 The workforce at the mine was retrained using the new policies and procedures.Root Cause:\u00a0 Management did not enforce its written policies, procedures, and controls for ensuring all miners wear seatbelts while operating mobile equipment.Corrective Action:\u00a0 The Company retrained the workforce at the mine in the use and requirements of wearing seatbelts while operating mobile equipment.Root Cause:\u00a0 Management did not enforce its written policies, procedures, and controls for ensuring mobile equipment operators complete pre-operational examinations prior to operating equipment.Corrective Action:\u00a0 The Company retrained the workforce at the mine in performing pre-operational examinations of mobile equipment prior to operating any equipment.", "CONCLUSION": "Jerry Baller, Quarry Manager, died when the haul truck he was operating traveled through a berm while descending a ramp at the bottom of the quarry road.\u00a0 The accident and fatality occurred because the mine operator did not: (1) maintain the haul truck\u2019s retarder system in a functional state; (2) ensure miners wear seatbelts at all times when operating equipment, and (3) inspect equipment and review maintenance logs prior to placing it in service.", "ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS": "Order No. 9307909 \u2013 Issued October 19, 2018, under the provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act:A fatal accident occurred at the McGregor Quarry on 10/19/2018.

Mandeville, MSHA District Manager, that there had been a serious accident at the No. 1 Surface Mine.\u00a0 At 11:15 a.m., Acord notified Russell Richardson, Accident Investigator; Andrew Sedlock, Surface Inspector; Joseph Presley, Staff Assistant; and Donald Phillips, Conference Litigation Representative Supervisor, of the accident.At 1:55 p.m., Richardson, Presley, and Phillips arrived at the mine office and issued a 103(k) order to preserve the accident scene and to prevent the destruction of any evidence that would assist in determining the cause or causes of the accident.\u00a0 They also conducted informal interviews with the miners and obtained their written statements.At 4:30 p.m., Sedlock arrived at the mine and performed initial function tests of the remote switch used to control the crane boom functions.\u00a0 Sedlock reviewed examination and training records before traveling to the accident scene with Dameron and investigators from the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST).\u00a0 The accident scene was secured, examined, and photographed.\u00a0On October 18, 2018, Sedlock and MSHA electrical specialist John Stone returned to the mine

Office of Miners Health Safety and Training Office in Oak Hill, West Virginia. \u00a0The persons who participated in the investigation and were interviewed are listed in Appendix A.", "DISCUSSION": "Accident SceneThe auger crane boom was found to be extended out away from the auger machine with a piece of auger steel suspended on the crane rope hook. \u00a0The remote crane boom controls were found on the ground near the operator deck (Appendix B). \u00a0The weather was clear and 57 degrees. \u00a0The ground around the auger was muddy and a stack of auger steel was stored next to the auger machine.Auger SteelThe piece of auger steel measures 18\u201d in diameter, is 12\u2019 in length, and weighs 647 lbs. \u00a0The steel is loaded onto the machine using an onboard, overhead, hydraulically powered crane.\u00a0 The auger helper adds or removes auger steel as needed.\u00a0 The auger operator stands in a different location and operates the conveyor loadout, thrusting jack, and auger rotation.\u00a0 The auger operator and auger helper have different and distinct tasks and do not supervise each other.Auger Machine Controls and Hydraulic SystemThe auger mining machine was manufactured by Salem Auger in 1986 and was purchased by the mine operator in April 2016.\u00a0 The model number is S-1500-B and the serial number is 2-2 Job #K2313.A crane winch hydraulic motor (crane winch motor) lifts or lowers the auger steel by extending or retracting a wire rope.\u00a0 A hook is permanently attached to the end of the wire rope for the purposes of lift or lowering.\u00a0 As designed, relief valves limit the maximum pressure available to the crane winch motor to 1,700 psi, to extend or retract the wire rope.\u00a0 Investigators performed testing and found hydraulic movements very erratic.\u00a0 When tested, the maximum pressure available at the crane winch motor was 2,350 psi.\u00a0 The hydraulic relief valve pressure of the crane winch motor (2,350 psi) was set 1.38 times higher than the manufacturer\u2019s recommended setting (1,700 psi). \u00a0This caused the wire rope and hook to jerk upward when trying to lift a load.\u00a0 Investigators determined that adjustments were made to the operating hydraulic pressures that were not in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s specified pressure settings, but they could not determine who made the adjustments.A crane boom hydraulic cylinder (crane boom jack) rotates or swings the boom away from the auger machine or toward the auger machine.\u00a0 Investigators found that the hydraulic relief valve pressure for the crane boom jack was 960 psi, which was 2.74 times higher than the manufacturer\u2019s recommended setting of 350 psi. \u00a0This caused the crane boom swing to operate suddenly with a jerking motion.\u00a0 Investigators also found that, without any operator input, the crane boom was always moving at idle speed, either toward the machine or away from the machine.\u00a0Investigators determined there was a defect in the crane boom swing toggle switch on the crane control handset.\u00a0 See \u201cboom out\u201d and \u201cin\u201d in Appendix C.\u00a0 When tested, in several instances this switch was placed in the swing out position, but the crane boom did not swing.\u00a0 For it to work, the switch had to be moved back and forth a few times.Investigators found a brass alloy water-oil-gas gate valve, not a part of the original design, on the crane boom jack that was not rated for the operating pressure of the machine.\u00a0 Also, an extra, unused switch marked \u201cTrolley\u201d was installed on the crane control (see Appendix C).\u00a0 This \u201cTrolley\u201d control served no purpose since this machine did not have an extendable boom.Investigators determined that the remote was equipped with a crane boom in-out \u201cTrolley\u201d switch that was not connected because the boom did not have this capability to extend and retract the length of the boom.\u00a0 The investigation team inspected the controls of the auger machine and conducted tests on the auger\u2019s crane boom hydraulic functions.\u00a0 Investigators determined that the on/off switch on the remote control was reversed (see Appendix D).\u00a0 When the switch was in the \u201coff\u201d position, the system was actually on.\u00a0 Also, the crane boom would slowly swing outward without operator input.\u00a0 Testing showed that when the crane boom toggle switch was placed in the neutral (stopped) position, the crane boom would swing out slowly away from the machine instead of staying still.\u00a0 The drift rate was 70 degrees per minute when there was no load on the crane boom and 45 degrees per minute when the crane boom was carrying an auger steel.Investigators found several hydraulic oil leaks, including some that were mixed with coal dust, and there were oil accumulations on the machine in various locations. Hydraulic oil was added as needed at a rate of approximately 1-2 gallons a day and there was nothing noted in the maintenance record book about the oil leaks. \u00a0MSHA inspectors had previously issued two citations for oil leaks, and one citation for missing guarding, during the 24 months prior to the fatal accident.Investigators also determined the following:The hook permanently attached to the wire rope had been modified to the point that it could not be safely used to hoist the auger steel.\nA tagline was not being used to steady or guide the auger steel during installation and removal.\nPersons were not kept clear of auger sections being swung into position.\u00a0 All miners must be outside the swing radius of the auger steel.\nAfter the fatal accident, the mine operator replaced the auger crane boom system with a hydraulic arm and claw system similar to an excavator with a claw.\u00a0 This eliminated the need for miners to be near the side of the auger while auger steel is being installed or removed.Testing and ExaminationThe mine operator\u2019s records indicate that a pre-shift examination and two on-shift examinations were conducted during each shift.\u00a0 The pre-shift and the on-shift examination records did not show any hazards for the day of the accident.TrainingR. Herndon began working for the mine operator on October 15, 2018.\u00a0 When he began his employment he had 12 years of underground mining experience, had completed new miner surface training, but had no surface mining experience.\u00a0 The mine operator gave him experienced miner training on October 15, 2018.R. Herndon was hired to be an auger mining machine helper, a job he had never performed before.\u00a0 The mine operator was required to provide task training which would include adequate training in the health and safety aspects and safe operating procedures for this task, equipment and machinery.The mine operator did not provide adequate task training because he did not provide adequate training in the health and safety aspects and safe operating procedures for this task, equipment and machinery.\u00a0 Roger Woods, Auger Helper/Articulating Truck Operator, provided supervised operation training during production for a portion of the shift on October 15, 2018.\u00a0 Woods then provided additional supervised operation training during production during the morning of October 16, 2018.\u00a0 The October 16 training was performed for a portion of the shift until Woods left the job site to go to an appointment.\u00a0 On Wednesday, October 17, 2018, R. Herndon was assigned to operate the auger crane while not being supervised.\u00a0 As previously discussed, he positioned himself in a hazardous location while operating the auger crane with a suspended piece of auger steel attached which struck him in the chest resulting in fatal injuries.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management control.\u00a0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the operator\u2019s implemented corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident.Root Cause: \u00a0Improper adjustments were made to the operating hydraulic pressures by persons not familiar with the manufacturer\u2019s pressure settings.\nCorrective Action: \u00a0The operating pressures in the hydraulic system were set properly.\u00a0 The operator developed a written policy that permits only qualified employees to perform maintenance and adjustments on the auger mining machine.\u00a0 All employees were trained in the new policy.Root Cause:\u00a0 The task training provided by the operator was not adequate because the training did not include the health and safety aspects and safe operating procedures for the task, equipment and machinery, and supervised practice during nonproduction.\nCorrective Action: \u00a0The operator revised its task training program to include the health and safety aspects and safe operating procedures for the task, equipment and machinery, and supervised practice during nonproduction.", "CONCLUSION": "On Wednesday, October 17, 2018, at approximately 10:25 a.m., Roger W. Herndon, a 33-year-old auger mining machine helper (in training) with approximately 3 days of surface mining experience, received fatal injuries when he was struck in the chest while moving a piece of auger drill steel (auger steel).\u00a0 When he was struck, Herndon was using the onboard crane in an attempt to move a piece of auger steel onto the deck of the auger machine. \u00a0The accident occurred because the victim was not adequately trained and was standing in an unsafe location.\u00a0 Also, the mine operator did not properly maintain the auger\u2019s hydraulic system which compromised the safety of miners operating the machine.Approved By:\u00a0____________________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 _________________David S.

Dylan Filler, Roof Bolter (single boom); Austin Roy, Roof Bolter (twin boom); Jeff Fike, Roof Bolter helper (twin boom); Guzzo; and Rankin, performed their pre-operational equipment checks.\u00a0 Brandon Keener, Scoop Operator, retrieved the battery-powered scoop from the outby charging station while Kaven Hornberger, Utility-man, waited on Keener.After completing the required checks, Guzzo trammed the CMM to the face of the No. 3 entry. \u00a0Rankin and Cary trammed their MBCs behind the CMM.\u00a0 The CMM and MBCs were linked to move together as a train.\u00a0 Mining began at approximately 3:25 p.m.\u00a0 After completing the mining sequence in the No. 3 entry, the train was trammed backward and moved from the No. 3 entry, through the last open cross-cut intersections.\u00a0 The train then moved so the CMM entered the working place of the No. 1 entry, and the CMM was then used to remove a small (wedge) cut of coal from the No. 1 working face.After completing the cut in the No. 1 entry, the train was trammed backward, allowing Filler to tram the single-boom roof bolting machine into the No. 1 entry to install roof bolts.\u00a0 This placed the No. 1 MBC just outby the intersection of No. 3 entry, between the conveyor belt and the right rib line.\u00a0Guzzo and Baumgartner were on the outby end of the intersection, in the No. 2 entry, on the left side of the CMM.\u00a0 Guzzo signaled to Rankin using his cap-light that he was ready to move the CMM into the No. 2 entry.\u00a0 Because of the elevation difference between No. 2 and No. 3 entries, Rankin may not have seen the signal.\u00a0At approximately 4:08 p.m., Guzzo began using the remote control transmitter to tram the CMM into the No. 2 entry.\u00a0 Both Guzzo and Baumgartner detected that the No. 1 MBC was causing unusual resistance as the CMM moved forward.\u00a0 Guzzo stopped the CMM and Baumgartner said that he was going to the No. 1 MBC to determine the cause of the resistance.\u00a0 Baumgartner crossed over the bridge conveyor and approached the No. 1 MBC.\u00a0 He observed Rankin on the MBC with his back against the controls and his legs in an awkward position.\u00a0 At this time, Rankin\u2019s MBC was positioned in the intersection of the No. 3 entry with the rear (outby side) of the machine against the right rib (see Appendix B).\u00a0 The front of the MBC had pushed the belt conveyor tailpiece out of alignment.\u00a0 Guzzo decided to go to the No. 1 MBC and came to the victim\u2019s location.\u00a0 Baumgartner told Guzzo that the situation was bad and that he was going to call outside.\u00a0 He then signaled Cary, with his cap-light, to come up to the No. 1 MBC.At approximately 4:12 p.m., Baumgartner went to the No. 4 entry where hand-held radio reception was better, and called Ben Bowser, Surface Attendant.\u00a0 Bowser was instructed to call for an ambulance.\u00a0 Jack Ishman, Beltman and Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), was travelling the No. 3 beltline and overheard the radio conversation and immediately came to the accident scene.\u00a0 As soon as J. Ishman viewed Rankin, he left to retrieve medical supplies and a backboard from the section first aid supply station.\u00a0 Guzzo brought the battery-powered scoop to the accident scene.\u00a0 J. Ishman, Cary, and Guzzo secured Rankin to the backboard and placed him in the scoop bucket for transport.\u00a0 Guzzo operated the battery-powered scoop.\u00a0 J. Ishman and Cary began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and continued during the ride to the mine\u2019s slope.\u00a0 While traveling, they were met by Don Ishman, Mine Foreman, who assisted in administering CPR. \u00a0When they reached the bottom of the slope, Rankin was transferred from the battery-powered scoop to a diesel-powered scoop bucket which was more capable of ascending the steep grade to the surface.\u00a0 Guzzo operated the diesel scoop and CPR was continued.\u00a0 Attendants from Brockway Area Ambulance Service, Brockway, Pa., were waiting on the surface, and at 4:47 p.m., took over treatment of Rankin.At 6:01 p.m., Brenda Shumaker, Jefferson County Coroner, pronounced Rankin dead at the mine.\u00a0 The victim was transported to the Coroner\u2019s Morgue in Punxsutawney, Pa.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "At 4:13 p.m. on September 11, 2018, Bowser notified the Department of Labor National Contact Center of the accident.\u00a0 The contact center notified Randall Caramellino, Staff Assistant, at 4:30 p.m.\u00a0 Caramellino contacted D. Ishman at the mine and learned that the accident was very serious.\u00a0 Caramellino contacted Jason Boring and James Miller, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspectors (CMI) and Accident Investigators, who were dispatched to the mine.\u00a0 Richard Feigh, Coal Mine Safety and Health Specialist (Electrical), from the Clearfield Field Office was dispatched to the mine. \u00a0Feigh arrived at the mine at approximately 6:10 p.m., and issued a 103(k) order to ensure the safety of all persons in the mine. \u00a0Robert Roland, Clearfield Field Office Supervisor, also traveled to the mine to provide assistance.Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) personnel conducted the accident investigation in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mine Safety (PA BMS) and mine management. \u00a0The investigation team conducted interviews with miners, travelled underground, and took pictures and measurements of the scene. \u00a0See Appendix C for a list of persons interviewed and those participating in the accident investigation.On September 12, 2018, Miller and Michael Kelley, Assistant District Manager for Enforcement, travelled underground to the accident scene. \u00a0Later that same day, Feigh, Boring, and the PA BMS electrical specialists examined the CMM and MBCs to see if there were any electrical or mechanical deficiencies.\u00a0 They attempted to recreate the movement of the machinery that may have caused the accident, but without a witness to the accident, the recreation could not be done.On September 17, 2018, Feigh accompanied MSHA Technical Support personnel Patrick Retzer and Justin Daniels, Electrical Engineers, and Matt Wharry, Industrial Engineer to the mine.\u00a0 They travelled underground to examine the proximity detection system on the CMM.", "DISCUSSION": "Accident SceneThe accident occurred in the No. 3 entry intersection of the C-8 Butt Rooms Section.\u00a0 The CMM backed up across the No. 2 entry intersection to allow the single-boom roof bolter to pass by into the No. 1 entry.\u00a0 This action placed the No. 1 MBC (victim\u2019s MBC) just outby the intersection of the No. 3 entry, alongside the stationary conveyor belt. \u00a0The No. 1 MBC was idle indicating that the victim was not tramming it at the time of the accident. \u00a0The CMM, while it was trammed backward, then forward, pinched the victim between the MBC and the coal rib (see Appendix B).\u00a0 The victim was moved along the rib line for approximately 8 feet until the MBC reached the right outby corner of the intersection in No. 3 entry.\u00a0 The mined height at the victim\u2019s location is 46 inches.\u00a0 The mine floor was dry.Continuous Haulage Mining SystemThe continuous haulage mining system involved in the accident is an \u201cattached system,\u201d meaning that the MBCs and bridge conveyors are physically attached to the CMM, forming a train (see Appendix A).\u00a0 The train consists of one CMM, two MBCs, and three bridge conveyors.\u00a0 The MBCs are controlled by equipment operators who start and stop the bridge conveyors as needed.An Eimco continuous mining machine (CMM), model number 25M-0, was connected to the first bridge conveyor, which was connected to the No. 1 Long Airdox MBC, model number MBC-27CL.Next, the No. 1 MBC, operated by Rankin, was connected to the second bridge conveyor, which was connected to the (outby) No. 2 Long Airdox MBC, model No. 27CL, which was operated by Cary.\u00a0 The No. 2 MBC, in turn, was connected to the final bridge conveyor.\u00a0 As previously explained, mined coal was transported from the CMM, across the MBCs and bridge conveyors and dumped onto the section conveyor belt, which was connected to the main belt conveyor system, which carried the mined material to the surface.Mobile Bridge Carrier OperationOperator controlsThe MBCs are operated manually, with the controls being on the side of the machine.\u00a0 Due to the low mining height, the operator typically crawls beside the machine as it moves forward and backward.\u00a0 The No. 1 MBC involved in the accident was equipped with a piece of conveyor belt material that was attached to the MBC so Rankin could ride on it as the unit moved across the mine floor.\u00a0 This piece of conveyor belt is commonly referred to as the \u201cmagic carpet.\u201d \u00a0The magic carpet is typically used when there is no operator\u2019s deck attached to the machine.\u00a0 The deck is a solid platform for the machine operator to sit on and ride as the controls are operated.\u00a0 The deck provides lateral protection against crushing hazards because the metal deck frame extends beyond the MBC operator\u2019s body.\u00a0 The No 1 MBC was manufactured in 1988 with an operator\u2019s deck, but when it began to be used at the Kocjancic mine in 2013, it did not have an operator\u2019s deck.\u00a0 Investigators were not able to determine when the deck was removed or who removed it.CommunicationInvestigators learned that the CMM operator commonly flashed his cap-light to the No. 1 MBC operator in order to signal his intentions to move forward or backward.\u00a0 This method of communication is unreliable because it is difficult for others to see the signals when the coal seam is changing in elevation and/or the mining equipment is blocking the view of the equipment operators.\u00a0 Also, signaling does not provide confirmation that the MBC operator understood the signal. \u00a0A positive means of verbal communication by radio or pager would help to prevent miscommunication.Stopping and starting the CMM and MBCsInvestigators determined that the CMM moved the No. 1 MBC while it was idle.\u00a0 Because of this, investigators determined the scenarios in which the CMM could move the MBCs without the MBCs being trammed with the CMM.\u00a0 First, when the CMM was turned off manually or with the emergency stop button, the MBCs were de-energized.\u00a0 The CMM was then re-started and trammed prior to the MBCs being re-started.\u00a0 Therefore, the CMM was able to move the MBCs while they were de-energized.Secondly, the Eimco 25M-0 continuous mining machine is equipped with a model MDG MX3 IntelllliZone proximity detection system (PDS), manufactured by Matrix Design Group.\u00a0 The PDS utilizes an electromagnetic field and line-of-sight radio signal which allows the machine mounted components (electromagnetic field generators), and miner wearable components (MWC), to communicate with one another.\u00a0 When a miner wearing a MWC approaches a set distance from the continuous mining machine, an electromagnetic field is generated.\u00a0 This action triggers a warning (flashing yellow light and audible alert) on the continuous mining machine and the miner\u2019s MWC.\u00a0 If the miner continues toward the CMM, a \u201cshutdown zone\u201d is triggered, indicated by a flashing red light and continuous audible alarm, on both the CMM and the MWC.Investigators determined that entering the shutdown zone disabled the tram and conveyor boom functions of the CMM and shut down the MBCs.\u00a0 However, when a MWC was moved away from the shutdown zone, the tram and conveyor boom functions of the CMM were restored so that it could move the MBCs while they were de-energized.Training and ExperienceRankin had 7 weeks of underground mining experience, of which 2 weeks were as an MBC operator.\u00a0 He gained all of his experience at the Kocjancic mine.\u00a0 Rankin received 40 hours of new miner training from July 16, 2018 through July 20, 2018.\u00a0 This training was a combination of classroom training and a mine tour provided by the mine operator.\u00a0 The victim\u2019s underground experience from July 20, 2018, until August 16, 2018, involved general labor duties as he became familiar with the mine and working section.On August 16, 2018, Baumgartner task trained the victim to be a MBC operator.\u00a0 The task training covered instruction in the health and safety aspects and safe operating procedures related to operating a MBC.\u00a0 This involved instruction on pre-operational checks, examining the MBC for loose covers or broken parts, removing combustible material from the MBC, inspecting the fire suppression system, examining tram roads, operational checks and controls, exercising caution near cables and workers, post-operational checks, and de-energizing at the end of the shift.\u00a0 This task training also instructed Rankin to keep his extremities in a safe location at all times.Supervised practice was provided prior to the beginning of production and supervised operation during production.\u00a0 On August 17, 2018, Rankin was assigned to operate the No. 1 (inby) MBC, which he did for the two weeks and three days leading up to the accident.The operator submitted an addendum to the approved training plan which addresses the task training provided to new MBC operators.The addendum prohibits new miners from operating MBCs within their first thirty days.After thirty days, the new miner must receive supervised practice during nonproduction, supervised operation during production, and training in all safety devices and policies.The training plan addendum was approved by MSHA on October 30, 2018.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions that were implemented to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not provide a means of protection against crushing injuries to the MBC operator.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator installed a substantially constructed equipment operator\u2019s deck for lateral protection against crushing injuries to the MBC operator. \u00a0The construction of the deck is consistent with the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s design. \u00a0Additionally, the mine operator installed \u201cman-in-position\u201d safety devices on the MBCs to deactivate the tram motors of the CMM and both MBCs when an MBC operator exits the operator\u2019s deck.\u00a0 The devices prevent restarting the CMM or any MBC until the operator returns to position.\u00a0 The mine operator also instituted preoperational examinations of the man-in-position safety device.\u00a0 The examination and results must be recorded and signed by a foreman, and defects affecting safety must be fixed before any MBC is used.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not provide a means for the MBC operators and the CMM operator to communicate verbally before the CMM is trammed.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator provided all MBC operators and the CMM operator with a stand-alone, permissible, two-way voice communication system.\u00a0 The mine operator instituted a company policy that requires the CMM operator to receive verbal confirmation from the MBC operators prior to starting to tram.\u00a0 All CMM and MBC operators have been trained in this policy.Root Cause:\u00a0 There was no electronic means provided to prevent the CMM from tramming and dragging the MBC while the MBC was de-energized.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator installed a system that causes all the tram functions of all electrical components (CMM and MBCs) to be de-energized when one component shuts off, either intentionally or by proximity detection.\u00a0 Additionally, the system requires a physical start-up function that must be performed on each component before any of the components have the ability to tram.", "CONCLUSION": "On Tuesday, September 11, 2018, at approximately 4:10 p.m., Kameron Rankin, a 27-year-old mobile bridge carrier operator with 7 weeks of mining experience was fatally injured.\u00a0 The accident occurred when the continuous mining machine was being re-positioned.\u00a0 Because the victim\u2019s mobile bridge carrier was connected to the mining machine, the carrier moved and the victim was crushed between the carrier and coal rib.\u00a0The accident occurred because the administrative and engineering controls in place at the mine were not adequate to protect the victim from crushing injuries.Approved

Grostefon reported for work on his normally scheduled night shift.\u00a0 Grostefon was assigned to operate a Caterpillar 793C haul truck, hauling overburden. \u00a0His travel route for this shift was from the company number 1-195 shovel, located in Pit 4, to the North and South ends of the Pit 4 dump, a distance of approximately 1 mile.At approximately 3:40 a.m., Grostefon drove to the South dump and positioned the truck to dump the load of overburden near the berm of the dump site. \u00a0John Moreland, Bulldozer Operator, noticed flames coming from underneath the operator\u2019s cab and wrapping around to the front of the truck as it passed by.\u00a0 Moreland told investigators that he attempted to contact Grostefon on the company radio to notify him of the fire, but by then Grostefon was already trying to get off the truck. \u00a0Moreland called out a Code Red over the company radio to report an equipment fire on the Pit 4 South dump site.\u00a0 A Code Red is used at the mine to alert miners and the mine\u2019s emergency response crews of an emergency situation.\u00a0The company dispatch center reported that Grostefon\u2019s truck went offline at approximately 3:44 a.m.\u00a0 The truck likely lost communication due to fire damage to the electrical wiring.According to comments by Grostefon during the rescue and in the hospital, as well as testimony from witnesses, Grostefon tried twice to actuate the fire suppression system in the cab but it did not activate.\u00a0 As Grostefon exited the left side of the cab, he received burns from flames coming through the grated steel walkway outside, and his polyester shirt caught on fire. \u00a0Grostefon continued along the grated steel walkway while trying to remove his shirt.\u00a0 He attempted to use the alternative egress ladder but he could not unfasten a section of handrail that blocked him. He then descended the truck\u2019s main stairs, in front of the engine. The stairs ended at a platform about 5 feet 3 inches above the ground. From there, another set of stairs is usually lowered to the ground using hydraulic power. However, the Power Step stairs did not fully descend when Grostefon tried twice to lower them. He then jumped to the ground.Moreland exited the bulldozer and went toward Grostefon\u2019s truck. When he saw that Gostefon was clear of the fire, he returned to his bulldozer to reposition it out of the way of emergency vehicles.Cody Faulk, Fill-in Shift Foreman, was at the equipment parking area when he heard Moreland announce the Code Red. He drove to the South dump, calling for a company ambulance over the radio on the way. He told the ambulance crew to go to the Intercept 1 point at the Pit 4 employee parking lot.Faulk arrived at the accident site about 2 to 3 minutes after hearing the Code Red. \u00a0He saw Grostefon bent over with his shirt lying on the ground. \u00a0Grostefon got in Faulk\u2019s pickup truck and they moved away from the fire. \u00a0After Moreland also got in the truck, Faulk drove to the Intercept 1 point.\u00a0 Tyler Potts, Senior Lead Shot Firer, followed Faulk\u2019s truck to the Intercept 1 point.When the group arrived at the Intercept 1 point, Grostefon was transferred to the company ambulance driven by Matt Plano, Preparation Plant Electrician. Moreland, Potts, and Plano, all members of the Surface Mine Emergency Team (SMET), treated Grostefon\u2019s burns by irrigating them with saline and applying burn gel bandages. \u00a0Grostefon had burns on his head, back, and arms.\u00a0 The SMET team assessed them as 2nd degree burns.Josh Damron, Water Truck Operator, arrived at the scene of the accident 4 to 5 minutes after hearing the Code Red over the company radio. \u00a0Damron extinguished the fire in approximately 5 minutes, using the water cannon on the truck.\u00a0 Damron then repositioned the water truck to spray water on the left front tire to help cool it. \u00a0An additional company water truck and a volunteer fire crew from Dugger, Indiana arrived on scene to assist.The Sullivan County Ambulance Team arrived at 4:23 a.m. and took over Grostefon\u2019s care. Grostefon was taken to Terre Haute Regional Hospital in Terre Haute, Indiana.\u00a0 After his injuries were assessed, he was transferred to Eskenazi Burn Center in Indianapolis, Indiana.\u00a0 Grostefon died from complications from his injuries after five days of treatment.\u00a0 He was pronounced dead on September 12, 2018, at 7:12 p.m.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "The accident occurred on September 7, 2018, at approximately 3:44 a.m.\u00a0 It was not immediately reported by the mine operator because Grostefon\u2019s injuries were not initially considered to be reportable. After the injuries were reassessed at Terre Haute Regional Hospital, the mine operator notified MSHA.Brock Rider, Safety Supervisor, called the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center at 7:46 a.m. on September 7, 2018, to report the accident.\u00a0 At 8:01 a.m., the Contact Center notified Doug Herndon, Roof Control Supervisor.\u00a0 Herndon notified George Heacock, Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, who in turn assigned Dustin Galloway, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, to investigate the accident.Galloway arrived at the mine and issued a 103(k) order at 9:35 a.m.\u00a0 Galloway then traveled to the South dump accident site to conduct the initial on-site investigation.\u00a0 Ryan Swaringen, Fire Suppression Technician, with Cintas Corporation, which installed and maintained the fire suppression system on the haul truck, assisted in the examination.On September 10, 2018, Jason Noel, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Surface Specialist, inspected the 2-170 haul truck.On September 11, 2018, Bub Whitfield, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Electrical Specialist, traveled to the mine with Noel to continue the investigation.\u00a0 Noel conducted informal interviews.\u00a0On September 12, 2018, Whitfield and Noel continued their investigation.\u00a0 Chad Barras, Peabody Director of Safety and Compliance, notified MSHA District Manager Ronald W. Burns that Grostefon had died from complications from his injuries.On September 13, 2018, Terry Marshall and Mark Kvitkovich, Mechanical Engineers with MSHA Technical Support, worked with investigators to examine the hydraulic stair on the 2-170 haul truck.On September 19, 2018, formal interviews were conducted at the Bear Run Mine.\u00a0 See Appendix A for a list of those interviewed.On September 25, 26, and 27, 2018, Kvitkovich and Michael Hockenberry, Fire Protection Engineer with MSHA Technical Support, worked with investigators to determine the cause of the fire and examine the fire suppression system.", "DISCUSSION": "Company Number 2-170 Caterpillar 793C haul truckThe company number 2-170 Caterpillar 793C haul truck, serial number 4AR00300, was manufactured in 1997. \u00a0The rigid frame haul truck was placed into service at the mine on April 20, 2010 to haul overburden. \u00a0The 240-ton truck was equipped with a 2,166 horsepower Caterpillar diesel engine and had a 24 Volt direct current (VDC) electrical system.\u00a0 The mine operator reported the truck had 116,945 operating hours.The mine operator contracted Cintas to install an ANSUL LT-A-101-30 manual fire suppression system on the haul truck on April 21, 2010. \u00a0The following year, on August 24, 2011, the mine operator installed a Power Step Inc. electro-hydraulic folding stair assembly (see Appendix B) on the primary egress stairs.Likely Cause of FireThe likely cause of fire was traced to a ruptured steering hose underneath the operator\u2019s cab (see Appendix C). \u00a0The hose, which supplied the primary hydraulic pressure from the steering valve to the steering metering pump, had multiple broken steel wire braids in an area about 1-1/2\u201d by 1-1/2\u201d. The interior hose liner also had a hole about 1/8\u201d-inch wide by 1-inch long.\u00a0 Investigators were not able to determine why the hose ruptured.According to the manufacturer, pressure in the hose can reach 3,100 psi during steering operations.\u00a0 At the time the fire started, the operator would probably have been making a sweeping turn to line up the truck with the dump point location.\u00a0 That turn would have provided full pressure to the hose that failed, possibly causing the rupture and allowing high pressure hydraulic fluid to spray onto the hot surfaces of the engine. This would have resulted in a fast-growing fire.Fire Suppression SystemThe fire suppression system consisted of four storage tanks, each capable of holding 30 pounds of multipurpose dry chemical agent.\u00a0 The four tanks were mounted on the right side of the truck deck near the engine compartment and were plumbed together to discharge simultaneously when actuated. \u00a0The four storage tanks and expellant cartridges received minimal heat damage from the fire.\u00a0 \u00a0Sixteen fixed discharge nozzles were located around the perimeter of the engine compartment.\u00a0\u00a0The truck had two manual actuator stations, one in the cab to the right of the truck operator\u2019s seat near the gear console, and one on the front bumper of the truck that was accessible at ground level. To actuate the system, the truck operator would pull a pin and depress the plunger, which would in turn break a foil seal, setting off a burst of pressure through the actuator hoses. The pressure would then cause nitrogen bottles on the chemical storage tanks to discharge, sending fire suppression chemicals to the 16 nozzles and extinguishing the fire.Investigators found that the actuator station in the cab had been used. The safety pin had been pulled and the actuator bottle in the cab had been discharged.\u00a0 However, the nitrogen bottles on the chemical storage tanks had not been discharged, and the four storage tanks still contained the proper amount of fire suppression powder.\u00a0 When tested, the pneumatic actuators on the storage tanks and the safety relief valve operated properly.The fire suppression system actuation hoses were routed through the engine compartment of the truck and were not sleeved with an extreme temperature heat-resistant fire jacket, contrary to recommendations in the ANSUL Vehicle Fire Suppression and Detection Systems manual. The manual describes the engine compartment as a typical vehicle fire hazard and states, \u201cDo not route actuation hose through fire hazard areas.\u00a0 If this cannot be avoided, the hose must be fire jacketed.\u201dThe destruction of the actuation hoses in a fire would make the fire suppression system inoperable because the hoses would not be able to transfer pressure from the manual actuators to the actuators on the dry chemical storage tanks. \u00a0MSHA\u2019s investigation found that the rubber components (inner and outer hose coverings) in the engine compartment were consumed in the fire.\u00a0The investigation noted that the actuator in the cab was near a display screen that provides the truck operator with instructions from the control room.\u00a0 Although the plastic components were consumed in the fire, the metal mounting post for the display screen remained intact.\u00a0 The screen may have obstructed attempts to strike the manual actuator depending on how the mounting arm was positioned prior to the fire.The manual actuator on the front bumper had not been activated. \u00a0The safety pin was still in place and the foil seal was still intact.The fire suppression system included an engine shutdown pressure switch designed to shut down the engine automatically when the system is activated. \u00a0Upon inspection, the pressure switch appeared to be in the OFF position, indicating that, at some point during the fire, pressure from the actuation circuit reached it.\u00a0 The pressure may have been created when the victim actuated the system, or heat from the fire could have caused the nitrogen actuator cartridge to vent through the foil seal from overpressure. Given these possibilities, and the fact that the actuator cartridge from the cab had been removed and handled by Jeff Wheeler, Production Manager, before the accident was considered reportable, it could not be determined whether the shutdown switch was moved due to pressure from the heat or actions by the victim.Emergency LadderAn alternative egress ladder designed for emergency use was located in front of the operator\u2019s cab.\u00a0 Safe access to the ladder required removing a section of handrail that was held to the post by a chain. \u00a0The manufacturer recommended using a snap clip to allow easy removal of the chain, so that the ladder could be used quickly in an emergency. \u00a0However, in this case the chain was fastened with a screw pin clevis that could not be unfastened by hand. \u00a0This condition would impede the ability of the truck operator to use the alternative egress ladder.\u00a0 A miner would have to go between the upper hand rail and chain, below the chain or over the handrail to use the alternative egress vertical ladder.Folding StairwayA folding stairway -- Power Step model number TS793C2 -- had been installed to provide safe access to the ground from the end of the primary stairs, which ended more than 5 feet above the ground (see Appendix B). \u00a0The electro-hydraulic unit was powered by the truck\u2019s battery and controlled by switches at the top of the stairway and at ground level.\u00a0Tests and visual observations of the step assembly concluded that the electro-hydraulic unit itself was functional but the power supply cable had sustained fire damage.\u00a0 It is likely that fire damage to the power supply cable caused the unit to malfunction when Grostefon tried to use it.The hydraulic system had an internal leak which allowed the stairs to drift down when not latched, which explains why it was found by investigators in the fully lowered position even though a witness reported that it had been stuck halfway during the accident.\u00a0 A manual release intended to lower the folding stairs when electrical power was lost was inoperable because the pull rod was broken off inside the power unit housing.\u00a0A fuse that should have been installed inside the haul truck\u2019s battery box to protect the electrical wiring from damage due to excessive current, per the Power Step installation manual, had not been installed.The toggle switch, located at the top of the folding stairs, used to lower and raise the stairs was labeled incorrectly, reversing the up and down functions. \u00a0Also, the ground level switch, which was designed to be mounted on the top of the front bumper, was found stuck between the platform frame and the front bumper.Truck Inspections and MaintenanceMaintenance records for the required semi-annual inspection and maintenance of the fire suppression system were reviewed.\u00a0 The mine operator contracts a local company, Cintas Fire Protection, to perform the maintenance on all fire suppression systems on the mine site.\u00a0 Based on these records, the last three maintenance inspections for the fire suppression system were conducted on July 31, 2017, January 26, 2018 and most recently July 26, 2018.\u00a0 No defects were noted in the inspection/maintenance records.The pre-operational inspection conducted by Grostefon at the beginning of his shift on the company number 2-170 haul truck revealed no safety defects.Training and ExperienceOn September 17, 2018, John Dagner, MSHA Training Specialist, reviewed training records and found that Grostefon, who had 1 year of total mining experience, had received training as required by 30 CFR \u00a7 Part 48.\u00a0 However, Grostefon\u2019s Form 5000-23 training records were found to have documentation deficiencies. \u00a0A noncontributory 104(a) citation was issued to Peabody Bear Run Mining LLC for a violation of 30 CFR \u00a7 48.9(a).", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \u00a0Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions which were implemented to prevent a recurrence.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator and Cintas did not ensure the fire suppression system on the Caterpillar 793C haul truck, company number 2-170, was installed and maintained in accordance with manufacturer\u2019s recommendations.Corrective Action:\u00a0 The company number 2-170 haul truck has been removed from service.\u00a0 The mine operator implemented a written program to ensure ANSUL fire suppression systems on rock trucks are properly installed and maintained.\u00a0 In accordance with the program, an ANSUL certified vendor examined these fire suppression systems and all deficiencies are in the process of being repaired.\u00a0 Also, manual fire suppression systems will be replaced with automatic fire suppression systems.Additionally, all truck operators were retrained on the proper emergency shut down sequence and operation of the ANSUL LT-A-101-30 dry chemical fire suppression system.\u00a0 The mine operator implemented the use of a manual fire suppression actuator simulator and trained all end dump truck operators.\u00a0 Also, all miners were retrained in \u201cLeaks 101,\u201d a training course developed by the mine operator on identifying and addressing leaks and/or accumulations that could create a fire hazard.Cintas retrained its technicians who install and maintain the ANSUL LT-A-101-30 fire suppression systems on the Caterpillar 793C haul trucks in the requirements of the ANSUL manual.\u00a0 Whenever inspecting, maintaining, or recharging fire suppression systems in the future, Cintas technicians will inform mine operators that MSHA expects the actuation hose to be routed outside the engine compartment or fire-jacketed.\u00a0 For all future installations, Cintas will attempt to avoid routing the actuation hose through the engine compartment of this type of vehicle.\u00a0 If that cannot reasonably be done due to the configuration of the vehicle, Cintas will install a heat resistant fire jacket (heat shielding) around the actuation hose.\u00a0Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not ensure the primary egress stairs and the alternative egress vertical ladder were properly installed and maintained on the Caterpillar 793C haul truck, company number 2-170, to allow miners to escape safely in an emergency situation.Corrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator removed all of the Power Step boarding ladders from the Caterpillar 793 end dumps and replaced them with a fixed boarding ladder that is similar to the one installed by the original equipment manufacturer.\u00a0 The mine operator examined all alternative vertical egress ladders on end dumps and repaired/replaced any deficiencies to make sure they are readily accessible as per the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s design.\u00a0 The mine operator has trained miners on the installation, maintenance, and preoperational examination of the alternative egress vertical ladder.", "CONCLUSION": "On Friday, September 7, 2018, at approximately 3:44 a.m., Robert A. Grostefon, a 60-year-old contract employee with 1 year of total mining experience, was injured after a fire ignited on the Caterpillar 793C haul truck he was operating.\u00a0 Grostefon received burns while exiting the cab of the haul truck.\u00a0 Grostefon died due to complications from his injuries on September 12, 2018.The likely cause of the fire was a steering hose rupture on the Caterpillar 793C haul truck, company number 2-170, causing hydraulic fluid under high pressure to spray onto hot surfaces of the engine, resulting in a fast-growing fire.\u00a0 The mine operator did not ensure the fire suppression system was properly installed and maintained so that it could mitigate the fire as the haul truck operator escaped.\u00a0 Additionally, the mine operator did not ensure the primary egress stairs and the alternate egress ladder were properly installed and maintained, impeding Grostefon\u2019s ability to escape the fire.\u00a0Approved by:______________________________ \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ________________________Ronald W.

John B. Haines IV, President, is the principal official and Jason A. Galli, Superintendent, is in charge of health and safety at the mine. The mine operates seven days a week with two 12-hour shifts per day. The mine\u2019s total employment is 30 miners.\nBirdsboro Materials drills and blasts trap rock from a multi-bench quarry and uses wheeled loaders to load haul trucks, which feed the processing operation. The material is crushed, screened, and separated into various sizes. The mine sells the finished product to the construction industry.\nThe Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed its last regular inspection of the operation on January 22, 2018.\nDESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT\nOn August 22, 2018, Brent D. Cosner (victim) began work at 5:45 p.m. He met with Christopher J. Magill, Night Shift Foreman, who verbally provided a list of tasks to be completed at the secondary plant. At approximately 6:00 p.m., Cosner began using a high pressure hose to wash out accumulated material from underneath the Trio crusher. He then shoveled spillage away from the Red No. 2 conveyor and used a high pressure hose to wash out material from underneath the 8-foot by 24-foot screen deck. Prior to taking his lunch break, Cosner stopped for approximately 30\u00a0minutes to help Magill remove screens from the portable power screen near the secondary plant.\nMatthew D. Bachman, Secondary Plant Operator (Night Shift), observed Cosner with a grease gun walking along the No. 7 1B transfer conveyor catwalk. Magill and Bachman believed Cosner was completing one of his assigned tasks, which included greasing the plant equipment. At approximately 11:30\u00a0p.m., Paul D. Pavelick, Front-end Loader Operator (Night Shift), observed someone moving the mobile aerial lift toward the No. 3 tunnel conveyor belt. From his vantage point, Pavelick could not determine who was moving the lift. At approximately 11:45 p.m., Cosner used the aerial lift to access the take-up assembly of the No. 3 tunnel belt conveyor and became entangled between the rotating smooth drum take-up west bend pulley and the moving conveyor belt. There were no eyewitnesses to the accident since the other four miners were performing their assigned duties in different locations of the mine: Magill was working at the primary plant; Bachman was at the 1B stockpile checking the product for oversized stones; Pavelick was operating a front-end loader repairing haul roads on the south side of the mine away from the plant; and Christopher M. Flounders, Wash Plant Operator (Night Shift), was at the wash plant.\nBachman, the closest miner to the No. 3 tunnel belt conveyor (approximately 500 feet away), heard two loud screams and immediately ran toward them. When he arrived at the No.\u00a03 tunnel conveyor, he observed a person caught in the take-up bend pulley with the conveyor belt still in operation. Bachman ran to the electrical room and de-energized the secondary plant. Bachman called Magill, who immediately ran to the area, and both men ran up the conveyor catwalk to the take-up area. Moments later, Flounders arrived at the scene and ran up the catwalk to provide assistance. Magill yelled to Cosner and reached through the conveyor structure and shook him, but he was unresponsive. At 11:54 p.m., Bachman placed a call to 911. At approximately 11:59 p.m., Jonathan Huber, Emergency Medical Technician from the Southern Berks EMS, arrived at the scene. Huber checked for vital signs but found none. Cosner was transported to Reading Hospital and Medical Center in Reading, Pennsylvania, where he was pronounced dead. The final Autopsy Pathology Report stated the primary cause of the victim\u2019s death was asphyxia due to mechanical compression of the thorax with other significant contributing factors of blunt force head trauma and methamphetamine intoxication.\nINVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT\nJason A. Galli, Superintendent, called the Department of Labor\u2019s National Contact Center (DOLNCC) at 12:41 a.m. on August 23, 2018, and notified MSHA of the accident. DOLNCC notified Victor C. Lescznske, Supervisory Special Investigator, via the Northeastern District\u2019s emergency cell phone. MSHA issued an order under provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to ensure safety of the miners\nMSHA\u2019s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident site, interviewed miners, and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident. MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and miners.\nDISCUSSION\nLocation of Accident\nThe accident occurred at the take-up assembly of the No. 3 tunnel belt conveyor located at the secondary plant. The victim was entangled between the rotating west bend pulley and the moving conveyor belt.\nWeather\nWeather reports on the day of the accident indicated clear skies with an average temperature of 68\u02daF and a relative humidity of 84 percent. Investigators did not consider weather to be a factor in the accident\nEquipment Involved\nAerial Lift: The aerial lift used by the victim was a Model JLG 600S telescopic boom lift manufactured by JLG Industries, Inc. in 2004. With the boom extended, the maximum working height is 66 feet with a continuous 360\u02da swing. The personnel basket included a 3-foot by 8-foot solid working platform completely surrounded by a handrail, mid-rail and toe boards. The victim accessed the basket through a slide bar, side entry, inward swinging, self-closing gate. The platform capacity is rated as 500 pounds. At the time of the accident, the aerial lift basket was positioned approximately 36 feet above the ground. The victim was not wearing fall protection and was found entangled and suspended outside of the perimeter of the working platform handrails.\nNo. 3 Tunnel Belt Conveyor: The conveyor system was designed, manufactured and installed by Kemper Equipment Inc. at another mining operation owned by the operator in 2004. In 2005, the operator relocated and installed the conveyor system at its present location. The overall structure is 270 feet long with a 36-inch wide belt. The conveyor take-up section consists of two smooth drum bend pulleys (east and west) and a weighted, 16-inch diameter face winged take-up pulley. The victim was found entangled between the rotating west bend pulley and the moving conveyor belt.\nThe victim used the aerial lift to access the No. 3 tunnel belt conveyor take-up assembly to clean the west side bend pulley with a 15-inch pry bar. The victim did not de-energize, lock out, and block the conveyor against motion prior to performing this task.\nDuring the investigation, mine management stated the proper way to clean a buildup of material from a take-up bend pulley while the conveyor is in operation is to use a high pressure water hose from the conveyor catwalk and spray through the associated guarding. Reportedly, a hose is pulled up to the adjacent catwalk using a rope and tied to the handrail prior to directing the spray toward the conveyor component. Investigators identified a water hose located within 23\u00a0feet of the accident location. Mine management could not provide documentation the victim was task trained in this remote cleaning procedure.\nTRAINING AND EXPERIENCE\nBrent D. Cosner worked at Birdsboro Materials for 1 year, 17 weeks and 5 days. A representative of MSHA\u2019s Educational Field and Small Mines Services (EFSMS) staff conducted a review of the mine operator\u2019s training plan and records. In April 2017, Cosner completed 17 hours of training as part of his new miner training and completed an additional 1.5 hours later that year. In December 2017, he received 8 hours of annual refresher training. The investigators found no documentation indicating he received task training to be a groundman or laborer and no training in the operation of the secondary plant and conveyor maintenance. All of this task training would have covered critical components of his regular job duties. Cosner did, however, receive task training to operate an aerial lift, a backhoe and a skid steer loader in 2017 and 2018. EFSMS determined Mr. Cosner did not receive all of the required training according to 30 CFR Part 46, including 24-hour new miner training (30 CFR \u00a7 46.5) and task training (30 CFR \u00a7 46.7(a)).\nThe accident investigation team reviewed all of the miners\u2019 training records and noted discrepancies in the records. Many of the miners were assigned work duties prior to receiving required Part 46 training. MSHA issued noncontributory citations during an E16 Spot Inspection for these violations.\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS\nThe accident investigation team conducted a root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the accident. The team identified the following root causes and the corresponding corrective actions implemented to prevent a recurrence.\nRoot Cause: Management did not establish policies and procedures to ensure proper cleaning of the conveyor components at the mine, including the take-up bend pulleys on the No. 3 tunnel belt conveyor.\nCorrective Action: Management installed self-cleaning wing bend pulleys and two belt scrapers to remove build-up on the return side of the belts prior to reaching the bend pulleys. The mine operator established and implemented a written policy outlining the proper procedures for cleaning conveyor components. All miners responsible for cleaning conveyor components were trained in the new policy and procedures.\nRoot Cause: The No. 3 Tunnel Belt Conveyor was not de-energized, locked out, or blocked against hazardous motion prior to the victim performing a maintenance task (manually cleaning the take-up bend pulley).\nCorrective Action: Management had a maintenance checklist for employees\u2019 use prior to performing maintenance tasks on plant machinery, which included the requirement to lock out and tag out the various components. After the accident, management instituted a formal Repair Order Lock Out / Tag Out policy and trained all miners in its requirements, which included blocking critical components.\nRoot Cause: Management did not provide all of the required 30 CFR Part 46 training to the victim who was hired as a new miner.\nCorrective Action: To address training deficiencies found and cited during the E16 Spot Inspection, the operator has revised the training plan and provided additional training to employees, as needed.\nCONCLUSION\nBrent D. Cosner died while attempting to manually clean a buildup of material from a conveyor take-up bend pulley. The accident occurred because the conveyor was not de-energized, locked out or blocked against hazardous motion prior to cleaning the pulley. Mine management did not provide appropriate task training to the victim so he understood the hazards associated with the work being performed.\n": "", "ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS": "Order No. 4724341 \u2013 Issued on August 23, 2018, under the provisions of section 103(k) of the Mine Act.A fatal accident occurred at this operation on August 23, 2018 when a miner\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0became entangled in the #3 tunnel belt take up roller.

Thomsen stated that he explained to Fernandez how to uncouple the railcars and how to set the manual handbrake, but did not instruct Fernandez to set the manual handbrakes on the two railcars, and Thomsen did not set the manual handbrakes himself. \u00a0Thomsen climbed into a Rail King 300 Trackmobile coupled to the number one car and left Fernandez to uncouple the number five rail car, approximately 250 feet away. \u00a0Thomsen stated Fernandez motioned him by hand to pull the three railcars.\u00a0 Thomsen began to pull the railcars. \u00a0He looked out the side window and saw the two uncoupled railcars (numbers five and six) rolling down the spur, but could not see Fernandez. \u00a0Thomsen stopped the train, ran down the track, found Fernandez lying between the tracks and called 911.\nEmiliano Gonzales, Plant Operator, saw Fernandez stationed at the uncoupling lever (between the fourth and fifth railcars) from the second level of the plant. \u00a0Gonzales stated he went into the office and upon coming back out a few minutes later, he observed Fernandez on the front of the sixth railcar attempting to set the manual handbrake. \u00a0At approximately 9:20 a.m., Gonzales stated he observed Fernandez being struck by the number six car and ejected from under the number five car. \u00a0Gonzales used his plant radio to advise management in an \u201call call\u201d that they needed an ambulance. \u00a0David Taft, Maintenance Leadman, heard the radio call and proceeded to the area where he observed Fernandez lying between the tracks and also called 911. \u00a0Two additional contract\n": "", "\nemployees, Dawson Barber, Loader Operator (Stout Excavating), and Jason Kieffer, Project Superintendent (Market and Johnson), were located on the west end of the property at the time of the accident and observed Fernandez riding on the front of the number six railcar, attempting to set the manual handbrake. \u00a0Both stated that the victim either slipped or attempted to jump off the runaway railcars.\u00a0 Kieffer stated that when he arrived at the accident scene, Fernandez was unresponsive.\u00a0 Kieffer checked for vital signs but could not feel a pulse.\u00a0 Taft and Thomsen began first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on the victim as other miners arrived to assist.\u00a0 John Ortega Jr., Chief Investigator for Bexar County Fire Marshall, happened to be on the mine site.\u00a0 He arrived on the scene and continued CPR, but the victim remained unresponsive.\u00a0 Bexar County Emergency Service District arrived at 9:37 a.m. and took control of the scene. \u00a0Fernandez was air lifted to University Hospital in San Antonio, Texas.\u00a0 The Bexar County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office personnel pronounced his death at 10:51 a.m.\nINVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT\nNathan Estep, Environmental Safety and Health Manager, called the Department of Labor National Contact Center (DOLNCC) at 9:30 a.m. on June 23, 2018, and notified MSHA of the accident.\u00a0 Inspectors Lance Miller, David Tijerina and Brett Barrick (Lead Investigator) were dispatched to the mine site to secure the scene. \u00a0MSHA issued an order under provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to ensure the safety of the miners and began the investigation.\n\u00a0MSHA's accident investigation team conducted a physical examination of the accident, interviewed 10 mine employees and contractors, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident. \u00a0MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and miners.\nDISCUSSION\nThe accident occurred on the south section of the company owned rail spur. \u00a0The spur enters the mine from a Union Pacific mainline on the west side of the plant. \u00a0The overall length of the south section is approximately 1,680 feet. \u00a0The accident occurred approximately 533 feet from the Union Pacific mainline.\u00a0 The runaway cars traveled approximately 586 feet from the point where they were uncoupled to where they were derailed by a Union Pacific owned derailer. \u00a0The two loaded cars passed over and destroyed a Hayes EBX #6 derailer that had been placed on the track by the mine operator at approximately 102 feet from the railcar\u2019s original point of origin.\u00a0 On March 2, 2018 this mine operator experienced a separate event where a railcar ran away and damaged the mines derailer. The Hayes EBX #6 derailer was installed in approximately the same location by a contractor after that incident. \u00a0\n": "Investigators estimate Fernandez rode the front of the number six car for approximately 321 feet before slipping or jumping and getting struck by the railcars. \u00a0The track\u2019s overall grade is approximately 3.5 percent and the railcars were traveling at approximately 18 miles per hour when Fernandez slipped or jumped from the railcar.WeatherThe weather at the time of the accident was clear, with calm winds, and a temperature of 88 degrees Fahrenheit. \u00a0Investigators did not consider weather to be a factor in the accident.Equipment Involved in the AccidentThe number five and six railcars involved in the accident are both manufactured by Trinity Rail and were on lease to the mine. \u00a0They are identified as TILX 338893 and TILX 338815. The railcars are 41\u2019 10\u201d long, 10\u2019 8\u201d wide and 15\u2019 4\u201d tall with an empty weight of 53,000 pounds. \u00a0On the date of the accident, each car contained approximately 200,000 pounds of dry sand. \u00a0The railcars are equipped with both air and mechanical braking systems.\u00a0Training and ExperienceRodney Fernandez had been employed at San Antonio Plant for 10 weeks and 3 days and had no previous mining or rail experience. \u00a0Fernandez was in the process of being task trained on maintenance activities in the plant. \u00a0This training did not include rail training.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "A root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified:Root Cause: \u00a0The accident occurred because the operator did not block or set the manual handbrakes to prevent uncontrolled movement of the two railcars.Corrective Action:\u00a0 The operator will retrain miners on its policy for blocking or setting manual handbrakes on railcars to prevent their movement prior to being uncoupled.Root Cause:\u00a0 The operator did not ensure the victim received new task training for work that he had no previous experience performing.Corrective Action:\u00a0 The operator will provide new task training to miners who are assigned to a task in which they have no previous experience.", "CONCLUSION": "The victim climbed on to a set of moving railcars in order to set the manual handbrake. After setting the manual handbrake, the victim slipped or attempted to jump from the railcar but was struck and died from his injuries. This accident occurred because the victim had not been trained in the task of moving railcars and was not instructed to block or set the manual handbrake. In addition, the operator did not ensure that the railcars were blocked or the manual handbrakes were set prior to movement of the railcars.", "ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS": "Order No. 9405608 \u2013 Issued on June 23, 2018, under the provision of the section 103(k) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977:A fatal accident occurred at this operation on June 23, 2018, when two miners were attempting to move rail cars on the spur track. One of the miners was fatally injured when he was struck by/run over by a moving rail car. This order is being issued to assure the safety of all persons at this operation. It prohibits all activity on the rail spur line and inside the barricaded area until MSHA has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in the area. The mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an Authorized Representative of the Secretary for all actions to recover and/or restore operations in the affected area.Order No. 8860297 \u2013 Issued on December 5, 2018, under the provision of section 104(d) of the Mine Act for violation of 56.14217:An accident occurred on this mine site on 6/23/18, at approximately 9:20 am, when a miner was fatally injured while assisting in relocating rail cars. The miner uncoupled the last two rail cars and they began to roll away.\u00a0 The miner ran to the moving cars and attempted to set the manual handbrake. The miner fell from the moving cars and was run over. The two loaded cars at the end of the train were not effectively secured by either of the braking systems. \u00a0Management engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence in that it did not ensure or instruct the miner to set the manual handbrakes or block the two cars from movement prior to uncoupling. This is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory standard.Citation No. 8860296 \u2013 Issued on December 5, 2018, under the provisions of Section 104(d) of the Mine Act for violation of 46.7(a):An accident occurred on this mine site on 6/23/18, at approximately 9:20 am, when a miner was fatally injured while assisting in relocating a rail car. The miner uncoupled the last two rail cars and they began to roll away.\u00a0 The miner then ran to the moving cars and attempted to set the manual handbrake. The miner fell from the moving cars and was run over. The miner had not received adequate task training nor did he have any prior experience in this task. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 states that an untrained miner is a hazard to himself and to others. \u00a0Management engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence in that it failed to instruct or ensure that the miner set the manual handbrakes or block the two cars from movement.

At 12:02 p.m. Rachel called 911 dispatch to report the accident. At 12:16 p.m., Tommy Fitzgerald, Mine Safety and Health Inspector, was dispatched to the scene to collect information and witness statements. David Hamm, Dallas District Safety Specialist was assigned lead investigator and dispatched to the scene.Rachel later called the Department of Labor National Contact Center at 1:17 p.m. Fitzgerald arrived at the mine at 3:05 p.m. and discovered a very large group of first responders, police and on lookers at the scene. Divers had entered the water and located Perez unrestrained inside of the haul truck cab. Once Inspector Fitzgerald established they had located the missing miner, he issued a 103(k) order to the mine operator under the provisions of the Mine Act to ensure the safety of miners, preserve the scene and to begin the investigation.On August 15, 2018, an MSHA Technical Support Mechanical Engineer examined the truck after the operator removed it from the impoundment. Technical Support, with assistance from VOLVO Product Assurance Engineering and ROMCO Equipment Company, determined the haul truck had been operating properly. The examiners discovered several mechanical defects such as: the audible low air pressure alarm had been disabled; the accumulators for both front and rear service brake circuits failed the accumulator test specified by Volvo\u2019s service manual; and both the front and rear service, brake circuits had hydraulic components that were leaking which allowed both accumulators circuits to lose hydraulic pressure without cycling the brakes.

Rodriguez, a 59 year old customer truck driver, received fatal injuries on April 12, 2018, when he fell from his truck and was run over by the truck\u2019s rear wheels.\u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Rodriguez was attempting to scan a card that identifies customer trucks entering the facility to load material.\u00a0 Investigators believe Mr. Rodriguez approached the Apex Express Radio Frequency Identification Card Reader (RFID) but positioned the vehicle too far away from the RFID to scan the card from inside the truck.\u00a0 Investigators conclude Mr. Rodriquez removed his seatbelt, opened the driver\u2019s side door, and leaned out of the cab with his right foot on the clutch pedal and the truck in gear.\u00a0\nThe truck moved forward, causing him to fall ouThe accident occurred because the victim did not properly secure the truck by setting the parking brake and putting the vehicle in park before opening the door and leaning out of the truck.\u00a0\nGENERAL INFORMATION\nTrinity Materials, Inc. owns and operates the Rye Dredge & Plant (Rye), a sand dredge mine facility.\u00a0 The facility is located in Cleveland, Liberty County, Texas.\u00a0 Reid Essl, president, is the principal operations official.\u00a0 The facility operates six days a week on one ten-hour shift and employs six miners.The mine uses a large suction dredge to extract sand and gravel from below the deposit.\u00a0 A pipeline transports material to a wet screening plant that separates the material into four stockpiles.\u00a0 Heavy equipment loads the finished material into over-the-road trucks and transports it to off-site locations for use in construction.\n\u00a0\nThe Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed its last regular inspection of the operation on January 7, 2018.\u00a0DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENTOn April 12, 2018, at 8:30 a.m., customer truck driver Manuel G. Rodriguez arrived at the Rye Dredge & Plant to pick up a load of sand.\u00a0 Rodriguez traveled to the mine operator\u2019s RFID and attempted to scan his card.\u00a0 The RFID directs the driver where to go on the site to get material, or instructs the driver to go to the scales to obtain an empty truck weight.\u00a0 The driver must place the card within two inches of the RFID. A green light on the RFID indicates the scanner read the card.\u00a0 To avoid striking the driver\u2019s side mirror against the scanner, it appears Rodriguez stopped his truck too far away to reach the RFID from inside of the cab.\u00a0 Investigators believe Rodriguez unbuckled his seat belt and opened the driver\u2019s side door while pressing the clutch pedal with his right foot.\u00a0 Investigators believe Rodriguez leaned out of the truck with the truck in gear and his right foot slipped off the clutch, causing the truck to move forward.\u00a0 The sudden forward motion threw Rodriguez from the truck, and the truck\u2019s rear wheels ran over him.Angela Worrell, scale house attendant, heard a loud noise, looked through the scale house window and saw a truck on the side of the road near the RFID.\u00a0 Worrell went to the scale house door and saw someone under the belly dump portion of the truck.\u00a0 Worrell called for help on a hand-held radio and then travelled to the accident scene.\u00a0 Bryan Payne, customer truck driver, was sitting in his truck on the scales and saw Worrell running to Rodriquez\u2019s truck.\u00a0 Payne exited his truck and noticed the victim\u2019s truck was still running and in gear with no one in the cab.\u00a0 Payne put Rodriguez\u2019s truck gear in the \u201cpark\u201d position.\u00a0 David Parks, loader operator, heard Worrell\u2019s radio transmission and travelled to the scene.\u00a0 According to Parks\u2019s interview, Rodriguez had no pulse. \u00a0Parks began cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but Rodriquez did not respond.\u00a0 Robert Jones, dredge operator, arrived to relieve Parks with chest compressions while Parks prepared the emergency defibrillator.\u00a0 Liberty County Emergency Medical Services and the sheriff\u2019s department arrived at the accident scene at 8:58 a.m., and county responders attended the victim.\u00a0 Cody Parrish, Liberty County justice of the peace, pronounced Rodriguez dead at the scene.\u00a0 The cause of death was later determined to be \u201cblunt force injuries.\u201d\u00a0INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT\nJohn Worrell, plant manager, called the Department of Labor National Contact Center (DOLNCC) at 8:40 a.m. on April 12, 2018, and notified MSHA of the accident.\u00a0 DOLNCC notified William O\u2019dell, assistant district manager in MSHA\u2019s South Central District.\u00a0 MSHA issued an order under provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to ensure the safety of the miners, and the agency started the investigation.\u00a0MSHA's accident investigation team travelled to the mine, conducted a physical examination of the accident, conducted eighteen interviews with mine employees and customer truck drivers, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident.\u00a0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, miners, customer truck drivers, and owners of the truck involved in the accident.\u00a0DISCUSSION\nLocation of the AccidentThe accident occurred at the customer RFID, which is located on the road adjacent to the scale house, on the south side of the primary sand plant.\u00a0 The victim stopped the truck as it faced north on relatively dry, level and stable sand.Weather The weather service reported the weather at the time of the accident as clear, with calm winds and a temperature of 52 degrees Fahrenheit. Investigators did not consider weather to be a factor in the accident.Truck/Trailer Information The accident involved a 2007 Freightliner tractor with a belly dump semi-trailer.\u00a0 The tractor and trailer combination is commonly used on public highways in this region.Training and ExperienceManuel G. Rodriguez had 20 years of experience driving an over-the-road tractor trailer truck combination.\u00a0 For the last two years, Rodriguez picked up material at this mine site and transported it to end users.\u00a0 Trinity Materials provided driving policy and procedure training to customer truck drivers, and the training included traffic controls at the mine site and personal safety.\u00a0 Trinity Materials required customer truck drivers to report to the office/scale house or point of contact prior to starting work.Apex Express RFID Card ReaderRFID cards are used to identify trucks when entering or leaving the site. The software allows the mine operator to track the sale of materials.\u00a0ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS\nInvestigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified a root cause.Root Cause:\u00a0 The accident occurred because the victim did not properly secure the truck by setting the park brake and taking the vehicle out of gear before opening the door and leaning out of the cab.\u00a0Corrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator has discontinued the use of the RFID system and in the future will be using handheld and CB radios for communications with customer truck drivers. Site specific training now includes instructions to visitors advising them to set park brakes and place equipment in the park position prior to leaving the operator\u2019s cab.\u00a0CONCLUSION\nWhile attempting to scan a customer card on the operator\u2019s RFID, Manuel G. Rodriguez fell from the cab of his truck and the rear wheels ran over him.\u00a0 The accident occurred because the victim did not properly secure the truck from movement.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Approved: ______________________________\u00a0\u00a0 Date: _______________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Michael A.

national average of 3.66 for mines of this type.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On Tuesday, March 27, 2018, Anthony Boggs, Mine Foreman, gave Grubbs; Travis Saylor, Mine Examiner; and Josh Fuller, Section Foreman, their work assignments on the Section 004 MMU.\u00a0 The miners were working the third shift that started at 10:30 p.m.\u00a0 One of Grubb\u2019s duties was to replace the bad conveyor belt splice on the No. 7 conveyor belt.At 10:00 p.m., Saylor began to conduct a pre-shift examination of mine seals, located about 1,050 feet away from the main portal.\u00a0 This examination is required to be completed before other third shift miners are allowed to enter the mine.\u00a0 After completing this examination, Saylor returned to the surface area of the main portal.At approximately 10:30 p.m., Fuller and seven section maintenance crew members \u2013 Keaton Dillman, Scoop Operator; Gary Kirby, Roof Bolter; James Brown, Scoop Operator; Brent Raleigh, Roof Bolter; Donnie Burton, Continuous Mining Machine Operator; and Johnny Ray and Richard Baker, Electricians \u2013 traveled to the section in a personnel carrier.\u00a0 They arrived at the section at about 11:45 p.m. and began their assigned tasks.\u00a0 Tim Combs, Electrician, arrived at the section at 1:00 a.m.Grubbs and James Belt, Scoop Operator/Outby General Laborer, who was assigned to work with Grubbs to replace the bad conveyor belt splice on the No. 7 conveyor belt, waited on the mine surface for a personnel carrier to take them into the mine.\u00a0 At 12:28 a.m., a carrier became available and they entered the mine.\u00a0 On their way to the No. 7 conveyor belt, they stopped at the No. 1 conveyor belt to check previous splices and the No. 2 conveyor belt to gather splicing tools and materials.At 11:43 p.m., Saylor reentered the mine to conduct on-shift examinations of all mine conveyor belts.\u00a0 His plan was to start with the No. 1 conveyor belt and work his way to the No. 12 conveyor belt.\u00a0 All conveyor belts were running at this time.\u00a0 He stopped at the No. 7 conveyor belt head drive at crosscut 128 to take his lunch break. \u00a0Grubbs and Belt arrived while Saylor was eating lunch.\u00a0 While Saylor and Grubbs talked, Belt adjusted the take-up at the No. 7 conveyor belt head drive to prepare for the conveyor belt splice.Grubbs and Belt then traveled inby to crosscut 142 of the No. 7 conveyor belt entry to replace the bad conveyor belt splice.\u00a0 Belt stopped the conveyor belt switch by using a belt switch located at crosscut 141 and positioned the splice at approximately 38 feet away from the center of crosscut 142.\u00a0 Grubbs and Belt worked together to secure the conveyor belt clamps on both ends of the splice.\u00a0 Once the conveyor belt clamps were secured, Grubbs and Belt used two chain ratchets in conjunction with the conveyor belt clamps to pull slack in the conveyor belt.\u00a0 They then removed the splice by cutting between the clamps.\u00a0 Belt planned to install new \u00a0splicing materials to the outby end of the conveyor belt, and Grubbs would then do the same to the inby end.Belt completed the outby end of the conveyor belt splice.\u00a0 Grubbs knelt on the bottom conveyor belt to start installing the inby side of the conveyor belt splice.\u00a0 Belt was handing tools and supplies to Grubbs across the beltline.Meanwhile, Saylor finished his lunch at the No. 7 conveyor belt head drive and traveled inby along the conveyor belt entry to continue his examination.\u00a0 At crosscut 135, the clearance between the conveyor belt and the rib narrowed.\u00a0 Saylor\u2019s personnel carrier got stuck on the outby corner of the block of coal, causing the rear wheel to lose contact with the mine floor.\u00a0 Saylor placed a bottom roller hanger and rocks under the wheels to regain traction.\u00a0 When he maneuvered to regain traction, the personnel carrier pulled apart the conveyor belt switch wires where a splice had been made to connect the wires to the remote cable.\u00a0 Saylor decided to repair the switch wires and remote cable by splicing the matching colors of the wires and remote cable together.\u00a0 This inadvertently started the No. 7 conveyor belt at about 2:15 a.m.As the conveyor belt began to move, Grubbs became entangled in one of the loose ends of a ratchet chain used as part of the clamping process and was dragged over the top troughing rollers.\u00a0 Belt saw Grubbs being pulled by the belt and immediately crossed under the conveyor belt, jumped onto the personnel carrier, and headed toward the head drive to disconnect power to the No. 7 conveyor belt.Still at crosscut 135, Saylor heard a noise, which he surmised was from a bad conveyor belt splice. \u00a0The noise became louder and sounded more like the conveyor belt was broken and was contacting the troughing rollers.\u00a0 He saw reflective material on the conveyor belt and realized that something was wrong. \u00a0He instinctively flipped the conveyor belt switch in the opposite direction, but the conveyor belt did not immediately stop.\u00a0 Saylor then pulled apart the conveyor belt switch wires he had just spliced.\u00a0 The portion of the conveyor belt where Grubbs was located coasted to a stop at crosscut 135.\u00a0 The belt had traveled a total of about 585 feet (see Appendix B) with Grubbs on it.\u00a0Saylor observed that Grubbs was seriously injured, but was conscious and talking. \u00a0Saylor ran into the adjacent roadway and used his cap light to signal for help.\u00a0 Belt saw Saylor in the roadway and continued to crosscut 135 where Grubbs was located. \u00a0He remained with Grubbs while Saylor drove to the nearest mine phone located approximately 630 feet away.\u00a0 At about 2:20 a.m., Saylor called Dallas Halcomb, Dispatcher, and directed him to contact emergency services and notify appropriate federal and state officials of the accident.\u00a0 Saylor also asked Halcomb to ask all miners on the section to come to the accident scene and bring first aid supplies.\u00a0 Saylor traveled back to assist Belt in freeing Grubbs.Halcomb contacted local emergency services for an ambulance, and at 2:27 a.m. called the Department of Labor National Contact Center (Contact Center) to report the accident. \u00a0He also called Mike Dempsey, Mine Superintendent.Anthony Boggs, Mine Foreman, entered the mine at 1:32 a.m., arriving on the section at 2:26 a.m.\u00a0 Soon after arriving, he learned about the accident from Halcomb.\u00a0 Boggs then told Fuller, who was also an emergency medical technician, about the accident and ordered some of the crew to gather first aid supplies and travel to the accident site.\u00a0 At 2:30 a.m., Boggs and Fuller, as well as crew members Dillman, Kirby, Brown, Combs, and Raleigh, traveled to the accident site.\u00a0 Three other miners, Burton, Ray, and Baker, remained on the section.While waiting for help to arrive, Saylor and Belt continued their efforts to free Grubbs from the conveyor belt and ratchet chains.\u00a0 Belt took measures to control his bleeding, while Saylor traveled to the power center and disconnected the plug for the No. 7 conveyor belt drive and take-up.\u00a0 He also began clearing all supplies out of his personnel carrier so Grubbs could be transported out of the mine.\u00a0 During this time, Grubbs remained conscious and was talking.At about 2:50 a.m., Boggs, Fuller and the other crew members from the section arrived at the accident scene.\u00a0 Fuller conducted a medical assessment of Grubbs, while the miners worked together to remove Grubbs from the conveyor belt structure and ratchet chain.\u00a0 By this time, Grubbs had stopped talking but still had a pulse and was breathing. \u00a0The miners placed Grubbs on a backboard and onto a personnel carrier to be transported to the surface.\u00a0 Kirby drove the personnel carrier, while Fuller and Brown continued to treat Grubbs\u2019 injuries. \u00a0Belt was also with Grubbs, stabilizing his spine.\u00a0 Boggs, Saylor, Dillman, Combs, and Raleigh followed in separate personnel carriers.At about 3:05 a.m., Grubbs stopped breathing.\u00a0 Fuller checked for a pulse but found none and immediately began cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), which he continued until they reached the surface at approximately 3:15 a.m.\u00a0 Grubbs was placed in the waiting ambulance by members of the TranStar Emergency Medical Service (EMS).Moments later, an EMS crew member notified the surrounding miners that Grubbs did not survive.\u00a0 EMS personnel contacted their dispatcher to request the coroner to travel to the mine.\u00a0 Philip Bianchi, Harlan County Coroner, arrived at the mine at approximately 4:20 a.m.\u00a0 Bianchi recorded 3:17 a.m. as the time of death.", "INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT": "After receiving Halcomb\u2019s call that a miner had been injured in a conveyor belt accident, the Contact Center contacted Russel Weekly, Birmingham Field Office (FO) Supervisor. \u00a0Weekly notified Marvin Hoskins, Hazard FO Supervisor, of the accident.\u00a0 Hoskins sent James Daniels, Hazard FO Coal Mine Inspector (CMI), to the mine to issue a 103(k) order.\u00a0 Daniels issued the order at 4:00 a.m.Hoskins contacted Samuel R. Creasy, Acting District Manager, and Creasy assigned Jack E. Harris, Barbourville FO CMI, as the lead accident investigator.\u00a0 Creasy also directed Sean G. Davenport, Electrical Inspector, to assist in the investigation and Kevin D. Bruner, Sr., Barbourville FO Supervisor, to act as the family liaison.\u00a0 Creasy, Harris, Davenport, and Bruner traveled separately to the mine to begin the accident investigation.\u00a0 Harris arrived at 6:15 a.m. and the others arrived shortly afterward.\u00a0 Accident investigators from the Kentucky Division of Mine Safety (KDMS) were at the mine and participated in the investigation.After being briefed by Daniels, investigators from MSHA and KDMS jointly conducted informal interviews of the miners.\u00a0 Creasy, Harris, Davenport, and Bruner then traveled underground to the accident scene with representatives of the mine operator and KDMS investigators.\u00a0 They took \u00a0photographs and pertinent measurements.Deborah B. Combs, Educational Field and Small Mine Service\u2019s Training Specialist, traveled to the mine to review training records and the company\u2019s training plan on March 28, 2018.MSHA conducted formal interviews on March 30, 2018, at the MSHA Harlan FO. \u00a0See Appendix A for a list of those that were interviewed.", "DISCUSSION": "Mine Operator MaintenanceThe mine operator conducted mine maintenance on the third shift, beginning at 10:30 p.m. and ending at 6:00 a.m.\u00a0 This work included splicing and aligning conveyor belts, changing defective conveyor belt rollers, moving/servicing mining equipment, and other non-production activities.\u00a0A three-person crew is usually assigned to do outby conveyor belt maintenance, including conveyor belt splicing.\u00a0 On the date of the accident, the crew consisted of only Grubbs and Belt because the third member of the crew was absent.Underground Conveyor BeltsAll underground outby mine conveyor belts were 48-inches wide.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, there were 28,140 feet of conveyor belt and 12 conveyor belt drives.\u00a0 The No. 7 conveyor belt drive, where the accident occurred, was manufactured by AMS.\u00a0 The belt drive had 480-volt dual 200 horsepower motors, and a starter box manufactured by Trey K.\u00a0 Investigators determined that the conveyor belt speed was 610 feet per minute.\u00a0 After investigators turned a conveyor belt switch to the \u201coff\u201d\u2019 position, it took about 8 seconds for the conveyor belt drive to stop rotating.\u00a0 During this timeframe, the conveyor belt traveled about 42 feet.Conveyor Belt Splicing MethodConveyor belt splices were made in the following manner at this mine, after power was removed:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1) conveyor belt clamps were secured, about 10 feet apart, to the conveyor belt and then were joined together with chain ratchets near each edge of the conveyor belt; (2) the ratchets were tightened to pull slack in the conveyor belt, and then the bad conveyor belt splice was cut out between the clamps; (3) on each cut end of the conveyor belt, a mechanical splice was affixed to join the conveyor belt back together; (4) the ratchets were then released at the same time, putting tension on the conveyor belt; and (5) the process is complete once the ratchets and clamps are removed.The belt splicing materials used at the accident site included conveyor belt clamps, manufactured by Flexco (60-inch belt clamp bar set), and chain ratchets, manufactured by Harrington (3-ton sets; one had a 15 foot chain and the other a 20 foot chain).Lock Out and Tag Out ProcedureThe investigators determined that, in preparation for the conveyor belt splicing work, the belt switch was turned to the \u201coff\u201d position to stop the conveyor belt. \u00a0Grubbs and Belt did not open, lock out, and suitably tag the visual disconnect for the cable that supplied electrical power to the conveyor belt drive, which was located about 1,350 feet away \u2013 or a 10-minute ride in a personnel carrier.\u00a0 Had they done so, no other miner would have been able to re-energize the conveyor belt drive while repairs were performed.In his interview, Belt stated that most of the time before starting to splice a conveyor belt, a crew member would lock and tag-out the electrical power to the conveyor belt drive.\u00a0 He said that on the day of the accident, the lock out and tag out procedure was not performed because the third member of the crew was not present.\u00a0 Belt remembered that Grubbs did have a padlock on his mining belt to lock out the power.\u00a0Belt Switch Electrical WiringBy using on/off switches, a miner could stop and then restart the No. 7 conveyor belt, located several hundred feet from the electrical controls at the belt drive.\u00a0 These on/off switches, or belt switches, installed approximately every 500 feet along the No. 7 conveyor belt, were inby the No. 7 conveyor belt drive.\u00a0 The belt switches were electrically connected or spliced into a cable (No. 16 AWG, type S/O) with black, white, and green insulated wires.\u00a0 This cable is called a remote cable.The belt switches were spliced into the remote cable by separating either the white or black insulated wire.\u00a0 Each switch was connected so that it was between the two ends that were made when the black or white wire was separated.\u00a0 See the \u201cTYPICAL WIRING\u201d drawing in Appendix D.\u00a0 The Appendix shows that the wires of the switch, which are black and white, are not the same wires in the remote cable.\u00a0 The black and white wires of the switch are spliced into the black wire of the remote cable.\u00a0 The conveyor belt would run only when all belt switches were closed as shown.\u00a0 A belt switch was closed when it was in the \u201con\u201d position.\u00a0 The electrical power to the belt drive would be deenergized when one of the belt switches was moved to the \u201coff\u201d position because this would open the switch.\u00a0 The green wire was used for grounding purposes only.Saylor attempted to repair the damaged splice at crosscut 135 by connecting white wire to white wire and black wire to black wire.\u00a0 See the \u201cWIRING AFTER SPLICE REPAIR AT TIME OF ACCIDENT\u201d drawing in Appendix D. \u00a0This placed the belt switch in parallel with the No. 7 conveyor belt switches.\u00a0 Since the switch was in the closed or \u201con\u201d position, all of the inby belt switches were electrically bypassed and the No. 7 conveyor belt started.Training and ExperienceGrubbs received his latest annual refresher training on February 24, 2018.\u00a0 He had a total of 8 years mining experience of which 1 year, 17 weeks, and 5 days were at this mine.\u00a0 Investigators found no deficiencies in the training Grubbs received.Saylor had not been trained to perform repairs on wiring related to the damaged remote cable and belt switch wires.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The operator violated 30 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 75.512 and 48.7 because it did not train Saylor to perform repairs on electrical circuits", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \u00a0Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions which were implemented to prevent recurrence.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator performed repair and maintenance work on a conveyor belt, and did not properly lock and tag-out to ensure the electrical power was off while the work was being performed.\u00a0 The operator was splicing the No. 7 conveyor belt using only the belt switch to stop the conveyor belt.\u00a0 The mine operator did not have appropriate lock and tag-out policies and procedures.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator submitted a written action plan, which was reviewed and acknowledged by MSHA.\u00a0 On April 4, 2018, the operator adopted the action plan as company policy and put it in the training plan.\u00a0 The policy contains the following provisions:Electrical or mechanical repairs or maintenance that can result in injuries to miners due to the movement of conveyor belt shall not be performed until the following steps are taken to prevent inadvertent or unexpected motion of the conveyor belt:The person performing the work shall lock and tag the visible disconnect.\nThe tag will state the date and the name of the person performing repairs or maintenance.\nThe key to the lock shall be kept by the person performing repairs or maintenance.\nOnly the person performing the repairs or maintenance shall remove the lock after repairs or maintenance is completed.\nThe mine operator shall insure that no miner is in harm\u2019s way before starting the conveyor belt or belts.\nThe mine operator trained all employees on the new policy and procedures.Root Cause:\u00a0 The operator performed an improper repair of the remote cable and belt switch wires, which had been damaged during the on-shift examination.\u00a0 The repair caused the belt to start.\u00a0 The mine examiner had not been trained to repair the electrical circuit.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The electrical circuit was repaired by a miner who was qualified to perform this repair.\u00a0 The mine operator retrained all miners that repairs and maintenance on any electrical circuit must be performed by a qualified electrician.", "CONCLUSION": "On Wednesday, March 28, 2018, at approximately 2:15 a.m., Hubert Grubbs Jr., a 29-year-old Belt Foreman with 8 years of mining experience, was fatally injured when a conveyor belt on which he was working started unexpectedly. \u00a0He became entangled in the conveyor belt clamp ratchet chain and was fatally injured when the conveyor belt started.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, Grubbs and a coworker were splicing a conveyor belt.The accident occurred because the operator allowed employees to engage in repair and maintenance work on a conveyor belt without implementing proper lock-out and tag-out procedures to ensure the electrical power was off.\u00a0 The conveyor belt started because a mine examiner improperly repaired a remote cable and belt switch wires, which he had damaged during his examination.\u00a0 The mine examiner had not been trained to repair this electrical

Safety ManagerScotty Kent.................................................. Shift Mine ManagerThe Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) began a regular (EO1) safety and health inspection on January 2, 2017.\u00a0 This inspection had not been completed at the time of the accident.\u00a0 The previous regular safety and health inspection was completed on December 31, 2017.\u00a0 The non-fatal days lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for the Oaktown Fuels Mine No. 1 in 2017 was 2.06, compared to the National NFDL rate of 3.48 for mines of this type.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On Friday, March 16, 2018, at about 6:00 a.m., Williams reported for work on the day shift at the south portal of the mine.\u00a0 He attended a short meeting with Greg Hunt, Shift Maintenance Foreman, who assigned him to assist Unit No. 4 mechanics with coal hauler battery repairs. \u00a0The outby mechanics normally work in pairs to conduct maintenance and repair work on the unit and outby equipment throughout the mine.\u00a0 This day, however, they were split up so they could cover a larger area of the mine.\u00a0 Mine tracking system records indicate that Williams entered the mine via the elevator at 6:35 a.m.\u00a0 He then drove a 2-person Alpha diesel personnel carrier, company number KWT 36, along the travelway/secondary escapeway toward Unit No. 4.\u00a0Williams arrived on Unit No. 4 at 7:08 a.m. and helped mechanics Joshua Roberts, Doug Lauderdale and Ryan Nickless repair damaged batteries. \u00a0After completing the work on the batteries at about 11:38 a.m., Williams asked the group if they needed help with anything else.\u00a0 When they replied \u201cNo,\u201d at 11:39 a.m., Williams left Unit No. 4, and drove the diesel personnel carrier along the same travelway after leaving Unit No. 4.\u00a0 He did not tell the miners where he was going.\u00a0 The mine tracking system showed Williams traveled approximately 20,000 feet in the personnel carrier along the travelway, and at about 11:50 a.m. struck the right coal rib between crosscuts 135 and 136 of the M5 travelway.\u00a0 The diesel personnel carrier rolled onto its left side and Williams was partially ejected.\u00a0 He was trapped between the personnel carrier\u2019s canopy and the mine floor.\u00a0 There were no witnesses to the accident.A carbon monoxide (CO) sensor located between crosscuts 137 and 138 on the M5 conveyor belt measured 5 ppm of CO and went into alert status at 12:00 p.m.\u00a0 Miranda Lewlyn, Mine Dispatcher, looked on the tracking system and noted that Williams was located near this sensor.\u00a0 She sent him a text message asking if there was diesel equipment parked in the area to see if that was the source of the CO.\u00a0 The tracking system computer showed that he did not read this message.\u00a0 Investigators determined that Williams read text messages sent before the accident, indicating that the accident occurred before Lewlyn sent this message.Clayton Wise, Mine Examiner, was driving a personnel carrier while conducting a preshift examination of the travelways for the oncoming shift.\u00a0 At crosscut 30 of the M6 travelway, he encountered light smoke and smelled diesel exhaust.\u00a0 Wise attempted to find the source of smoke, and, as he traveled, the smoke cleared.\u00a0 He could see lights in the travelway ahead of him, but could not identify them.\u00a0 Wise arrived at the accident scene at 12:27 p.m. and found the personnel carrier lying on its side.\u00a0 He immediately ran to the vehicle to see if someone was injured.\u00a0 Wise found Williams trapped under the personnel carrier with the canopy on his chest.\u00a0Wise checked for vital signs but could not find a pulse.\u00a0 He then attempted to lift the personnel carrier off of Williams by hand but was unable to do so.\u00a0 At about 12:29 p.m., Wise notified dispatch of the accident and requested assistance.\u00a0 Lewlyn texted Scotty Kent, Shift Mine Manager, and L. Kenny Chaney, \u201cCall Dispatch ASAP.\u201d\u00a0 They contacted Lewlyn and she provided information about the accident.\u00a0 They proceeded to the accident scene in Kent\u2019s personnel carrier.\u00a0 While on their way, they encountered Hunt and asked him to go to Unit No. 1, and bring the Unit No. 1 ambulance to the accident scene.\u00a0 Lewlyn contacted James Todd, Unit No. 2 Mechanic, at 12:46 p.m., to tell him to take the Unit No. 2 ambulance to the accident scene.\u00a0 She also contacted Dowell and relayed information about the accident to him.\u00a0 At 12:47 p.m., Dowell called 911 to request the assistance of emergency personnel.Kent and Chaney arrived at the scene at 12:51 p.m.\u00a0 They determined that a forklift would be needed to lift the personnel carrier off Williams.\u00a0 They traveled to crosscut 1 on the M6 travelway to get a diesel forklift.\u00a0 Chaney dropped Kent off at this location and returned to the accident scene.Hunt and Todd arrived at the accident scene at approximately 12:56 p.m. with the ambulances.\u00a0 Chaney and Wise gathered wood blocks to support the personnel carrier once it was lifted off Williams.\u00a0 At 1:00 p.m., Kent returned to the accident scene with the forklift, which lifted the personnel carrier.\u00a0 Due to the extent of Willams\u2019 injuries, CPR was not started.\u00a0 Williams was placed in a basket/backboard and then into the Unit No. 2 ambulance.\u00a0 Todd and Kent transported him to the elevator. \u00a0Chaney and Kent accompanied Williams to the surface, arriving at 1:23 p.m.\u00a0 The Knox County EMS ambulance was waiting on the surface.\u00a0 Williams was placed in the ambulance and held at the mine until Brian Hagen, Knox County Coroner, arrived, pronouncing him dead at 2:30 p.m.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "Dowell called the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center at 12:46 p.m. on March 16, 2018, to report the accident.\u00a0 At 12:56 p.m., the DOL Contact Center notified Mary Jo Bishop, Assistant District Manager \u2013 Enforcement, that the accident occurred.\u00a0 Bishop immediately contacted Oaktown Fuels Mine No. 1 management to inform them of their obligation to preserve any evidence pertaining to the accident.\u00a0 Bishop contacted George Heacock, Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, to inform him of the accident.\u00a0 Heacock assigned Keith Duncan and Bobby Smith, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspectors, to investigate the accident.\u00a0 Smith arrived at the mine and issued a 103(k) order at 1:40 p.m.Duncan, Heacock, and Bishop arrived and began taking written statements and holding informal interviews.\u00a0 At approximately 5:45 p.m., the MSHA investigation team, along with Indiana Bureau of Mines\u2019 inspectors, and representatives from Sunrise Coal, traveled underground to the accident site for the initial on-scene investigation.\u00a0 See Appendix A for a list of persons participating in the investigation.An autopsy was performed on March 17, 2018, at Good Samaritan Hospital.\u00a0 The cause of death was attributed to closed chest and abdominal injuries, as a result of the victim being trapped under the personnel carrier.\u00a0 Also, the autopsy revealed no preexisting medical conditions or substances that could have contributed to the accident or cause of death.On March 19, 2018, Denzil Hughes, MSHA Supervisory Training Specialist, reviewed training records and found that Williams\u2019 training was up-to-date. \u00a0Formal interviews were conducted on March 21, 2018, at the MSHA District 8 Office in Vincennes, Indiana.\u00a0 See Appendix A for a list of persons interviewed.On March 26, 2018, Ron Medina, Mechanical Engineer, and Gary Rethage, Mechanical Engineer, both with MSHA Technical Support, collaborated with investigators to examine the personnel carrier involved in the accident.", "DISCUSSION": "Accident SceneThe accident occurred on the M5 travelway at crosscuts 135 and 136 in entry No. 4.\u00a0 This is a main travelway and secondary escapeway for the mine.\u00a0 The entry was approximately 7 feet high and 18 feet wide.\u00a0 The mine floor was compacted with no abnormalities or deformities. \u00a0When investigators arrived at the accident scene, they found the personnel carrier on its left side.\u00a0 It had been raised above the mine floor with two sets of 6\u201d x 6\u201d wood crib blocks under the canopy.\u00a0 Tire tracks showed the path the personnel carrier took to the point of impact.\u00a0 See Appendix B for a drawing of the accident scene.Investigators observed hydraulic oil and diesel fuel on the mine floor that spilled from the tanks in the rear of the personnel carrier.\u00a0 The right coal rib that the personnel carrier struck had sheets of wire mesh bolted to the coal rib and was well rock dusted, except for the point of impact twenty-one inches above the mine floor.\u00a0 The impact left a hole in the wire mesh that was 2 feet wide and 1\u00bd feet long.\u00a0 The right front bumper of the personnel carrier had been pushed into the right front tire which prevented investigators from being able to move the tire.The personnel carrier\u2019s front tire tread was compared to the tire track leading to the point of impact and found to be a match.\u00a0 The steering wheel and the windshield of the personnel carrier had no visible damage.\u00a0 No physical evidence found at the accident scene established why the diesel personnel carrier struck the coal rib.Company No. KWT 36 diesel-powered personnel carrierThe personnel carrier, serial number 3561, is a rear-wheel drive.\u00a0 It was manufactured by Alpha Services and is an Alpha Model A3-9-63-BZ.\u00a0 It is powered by a 63 horsepower (@ 2500 rpm) Mitsubishi engine.\u00a0 The MSHA approval No. is 07-ENA030001.\u00a0 It is equipped with a GM 350 automatic transmission and the rear axle was connected to the transmission with a drive shaft.\u00a0 The personnel carrier was equipped with 215/75R15 tires on both the front and rear axles.Examination & Evaluation of the diesel-powered personnel carrierThe GM 350 transmission was manufactured by General Motors with 3-speeds and was installed in passenger vehicles.\u00a0 The transmission gear ratios are 2.52:1 in first, 1.52:1 in second, and 1.00:1 in third. \u00a0The company that purchased this personnel carrier from Alpha Services requested an e-clip to be installed that prevented the transmission from going into 3rd gear.\u00a0 This e-clip limited the top speed of this personnel carrier to about 19.4 mph.The transmission installed on the personnel carrier was removed and examined.\u00a0 Unlike the Alpha design, it did not have the e-clip to prevent shifting into third gear.\u00a0 This allowed the vehicle to be shifted into third gear and travel approximately 10 mph faster (29.5 mph) than the original Alpha Services design.\u00a0 Since the personnel carrier was purchased by the previous mine operator, investigators could not determine who changed the transmission.\u00a0 Investigators were not able to determine the speed of the personnel carrier at the time of the accident.Although automotive-type power train components were used in the construction of this vehicle, the vehicle width is narrower than ordinarily found in passenger vehicle applications.\u00a0 Also, mine-duty suspension is utilized as opposed to a passenger vehicle suspension.\u00a0 The safety checklist provided by Alpha Services with each vehicle covers numerous operating and safety features including the following statement:HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS:\u00a0 As with all underground equipment, this vehicle does not handle like an ordinary vehicle.\u00a0 Failure to operate this vehicle correctly could cause loss of control of the vehicle, which could result in a serious accident.The mine-duty suspension and the narrower wheel track increased the potential for tilting or overturning the vehicle.\u00a0 However, investigators determined that the manner in which the vehicle struck the rib was the primary factor as to why the vehicle overturned.The brake system was also inspected. \u00a0The personnel carrier was equipped with a foot pedal controlled, dual circuit service brake system with disc brakes at all four wheels.\u00a0 There was no power assist.The personnel carrier was also equipped with a spring-applied, hydraulic-release driveline parking brake, with release pressure provided by an engine driven hydraulic pump.\u00a0 A hand-operated pump was also provided to allow release of the parking brake for towing.\u00a0 After the vehicle hit the rib and came to rest on its left side, fluid leaked out from the hydraulic tank for the parking brake. To allow the service brakes to be tested, hydraulic fluid was added so the parking brake could be released.The vehicle could not be operated under its own power because the engine was damaged in the accident.\u00a0 A motor mount was broken and the engine moved forward causing radiator and cooling fan damage. \u00a0The front and rear axles were intact and the vehicle could be propelled with assistance.\u00a0 The front right tire was freed by cutting a section of the bumper and lower fender to allow the tire to turn freely so that braking tests could be performed.The service brake system was not damaged in the accident.\u00a0 Both chambers of the dual service brake master cylinder reservoir, as found, were \u00bd to \u00be full which was adequate to allow service brake operation.\u00a0 No brake fluid was added to the master cylinder.The service brakes were tested in a surface shop area.\u00a0 Dynamic stopping tests from a speed of approximately 5 mph showed that the service brakes were adequate and could achieve a 0.25 g stop as measured with a Tapley Brake Test Meter.\u00a0 This is equivalent to the braking capability needed to hold the personnel carrier on a 26% grade.\u00a0 The tires slid during the stopping test so the measured braking force was limited by the available coefficient of friction of the crushed limestone test surface.\u00a0 The vehicle was carrying no materials at the time of the accident and was tested empty.All four tires were removed and the service brake hardware was inspected.\u00a0 The brake rotors were all thicker than the minimum disc thickness of 23 mm (0.906 inches) specified by the manufacturer.\u00a0 The steering axle brake linings were 0.29 inches thick on the left side and 0.31 inches thick on the right side.\u00a0 The drive axle brake linings were 0.25 inches thick on the left side and 0.22 inches on the right.\u00a0 These lining thicknesses were within the manufacturer\u2019s specifications.\u00a0 All the brake linings and rotors were dry and clean and not contaminated with oil or grease.In addition to the service brake testing, the parking brake, when applied, demonstrated the ability to slide the rear tires on a dry, smooth concrete shop floor.\u00a0 Additionally, the throttle linkage operated freely and returned to low idle upon release.The personnel carrier was equipped with coil-spring/shock absorber suspension on both axles.\u00a0 It was also equipped with an automotive-type power steering system.\u00a0 All the steering linkage was intact.\u00a0 The steering wheel could be turned fully in each direction when the engine was off.The vehicle had two forward facing headlights and one forward facing rib light angled to the right to illuminate the right rib.\u00a0 It was also equipped with a reverse light and a tail light.\u00a0 All the lighting systems functioned when tested. \u00a0The inside of the operator\u2019s cab and windshield were not damaged.The personnel carrier did not have seat belts at the time of the accident.\u00a0 Alpha Services did not manufacture this personnel carrier model with seat belts.\u00a0 Seat belts were provided as an option if requested by the customer.To meet the requirements of the initial purchaser, Alpha Services originally equipped the personnel carrier with clevises.\u00a0 A previous operator installed a safety chain, between the clevises, across the opening of the operator\u2019s compartment.\u00a0 Investigators found that the clevises and safety chain had been removed from the personnel carrier, however, they were unable to determine who removed them.SummaryThe service brake system, the steering system, the throttle linkage, and the lights were evaluated and no defects were found.Training and ExperienceDenzil Hughes, MSHA Supervisory Training Specialist, reviewed training records.\u00a0 Hughes determined that the training received by Williams, who had 16 years and 8 months total mining experience, was in compliance with 30 CFR Part 48.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the investigation and the operator\u2019s implemented corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident:1. \u00a0Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not assure that equipment operators maintain full control of the equipment while it was in motion.Corrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator retrained all miners on its existing safe operating program for diesel powered equipment.\u00a0 For personnel carriers equipped with three or four gears, the mine operator removed the ability for those transmissions to shift into third or fourth gear, in order to reduce the maximum traveling speed of the carriers.\u00a0 For personnel carriers equipped with only two gears, the mine operator utilized a mechanism to reduce maximum speed2.\u00a0 Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not provide safety features to prevent persons in outby personnel carriers from being ejected.Corrective Actions:\u00a0 The mine operator installed doors on personnel carriers.\u00a0 On

Bird, Night Shift Foreman and Fork Loader Operator, stated he arrived at the mine and met Hartley at the substation.\u00a0 Hartley was sitting in his truck and said the mining machine had lost power and he had lost cell phone service.\u00a0 Bird allowed Hartley to use his cell phone booster.\u00a0 When Hartley connected his phone to the booster he received a call from K. Owens informing him of the accident and instructing him to go to the mining machine.Hartley locked the power out at the substation and followed Bird to the mining machine.\u00a0 Upon arrival, Hartley helped Cassell and Harvey with CPR. \u00a0The 911 telephone recordings indicate receiving a call at 5:40 p.m. from an unidentified individual and at 5:46 p.m. from Hartley, reporting the accident.\u00a0 Bird stated he spoke with K. Owens on the telephone, gave him the ambulance telephone number, and went to the entrance of the mine to escort the ambulance to the mining machine.The Jan-Care Ambulance Service reports indicate that two ambulances arrived on mine property at 7:00 p.m. Emergency medical technicians found the victim to be non-responsive.\u00a0 Due to the extended time of CPR treatment (1 \u00bd to 2 hours) and the lack of response, CPR was discontinued per orders of Dr. Michael S. Johnson of Regional Command at Raleigh General Hospital. \u00a0The time of death was recorded as 7:04 p.m.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On February 21, 2018, at 9:23 p.m., Bruce Vance, Superintendent of Pocahontas Coal Company\u2019s Pocahontas Highwall Mine notified Jeff Branham and Aaron Cline, MSHA Coal Mine Inspectors, of the accident.\u00a0 The mine operator did not notify the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center to report the accident immediately, at once, without delay, and within 15 minutes once an injury occurred to an individual at the mine which caused death.\u00a0 As a result, MSHA issued a noncontributory citation for a violation of 30 CFR\u00a7 50.10(a).\u00a0 Although Hartley stated he called Federal officials when the accident occurred at 5:15 p.m.; he did not produce records of these calls and MSHA has no record of any calls being made before 9:23 p.m.At 9:33 p.m., Cline notified Nicholas Christian, MSHA Pineville Field Office Supervisor, of the accident.\u00a0 Christian notified Larry E. Bailey, Assistant District Manager (Technical); Clark Blackburn, Assistant District Manager (Enforcement); and Rex A. Hampton, Electrical Specialist. \u00a0Bailey notified Brian Dotson, District Manager.At midnight, Cline, Hampton, Christian, and Bailey arrived at the mine site and issued a 103(k) order to William D. Taylor, Superintendent of Operations.\u00a0 This 103(k) order was issued to preserve the accident scene and to prevent the destruction of any evidence that would assist in determining the cause or causes of the accident.\u00a0 Cline and Hampton conducted informal interviews with miners and obtained their written statements.\u00a0 MSHA investigators reviewed examination and training records before traveling to the accident scene with Taylor and investigators from the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST).\u00a0 The accident scene was secured, examined, and photographed.On February 22, 2018, at 9:00 a.m., Hampton, along with Charles E. Justice, Electrical Specialist; Jason Hess, Roof Control Supervisor; Brian Dotson, District Manager; and Tracy Calloway, Staff Assistant, arrived at the mine and met with WVOMHST investigators and company officials to continue investigating the accident.\u00a0 A non-contributory citation was issued for damaged areas on the mining machine trailing cable, which needed to be repaired before electrical testing could be conducted.On February 23, 2018, Hampton, Justice, and Hess conducted tests of the mining machine and substation.\u00a0 Testing of the substation included resistance measurements of the ground fields, as well as ground fault simulations to test the relay.\u00a0 Additionally, the mining machine transformer compartment back-up ground fault and the emergency stop switches were tested.\u00a0 All components were found to be in proper operating condition and no hazards or violations were observed that would have contributed to the accident.On February 26, 2018, MSHA and WVOMHST jointly conducted formal interviews at the National Mine Health and Safety Academy in Beaver, WV.\u00a0 The persons who participated in the investigation and who were interviewed are listed in Appendix A.On February 28, 2018, Bobbie Pauley, Educational Field and Small Mine Services (EFSMS), reviewed the mine operator\u2019s training records.", "DISCUSSION": "Accident Scene\nThe accident occurred in the transformer compartment located on the rear of the mining machine. \u00a0The victim was found lying on the floor of the compartment with the upper portion of his body positioned behind three high voltage transformers.\u00a0 An access panel adjacent to the transformer bank had been removed to gain entry into the compartment.\u00a0 This provided a 12 inch wide opening between the transformer bank and the incoming 7,200 VAC cable connections/load break switch (see Appendix B).Transformer Compartment\nThe transformer compartment measures 124 inches long, 53 inches wide, and 72 inches high and contains a three phase high voltage transformer bank, which transforms the incoming 7,200 VAC to 995 VAC and 480 VAC for the motors used to operate the highwall mining machine system.\u00a0 The compartment also contains another 480 VAC transformer, ventilating fans, high voltage lightning arrestors, and ground fault/ground monitor components for the 995 VAC and 480 VAC circuitry, along with a manually operated high voltage load break switch.\u00a0 The load break switch is a gang-operated (one action opens or closes three connections, one for each phase, at the same time) visual disconnect switch; it was found in the open position.\u00a0 When in the open position, the switch provides visual evidence that the circuitry in the transformer compartment is deenergized, except the line side of the switch, which remains energized with 7,200 VAC. \u00a0The victim came in contact with one phase of the energized portion of the switch, which caused him to experience 4,160 VAC phase-to-ground. \u00a0The grounding resistor, at the substation, was 261.3 ohms and the grounding circuit from the transformer compartment to the substation was 1.98 ohms. \u00a0The maximum possible ground fault current was 15.8 amperes.Testing and Examination\nThe mine operator\u2019s records indicate that a pre-shift examination and two on-shift examinations are conducted during each shift.\u00a0 The pre-shift and the on-shift examination records did not show any hazards or violations for the day of the accident.The last monthly electrical examination of the mining machine, including ground faulting all breakers, was conducted by K. Owens on January 6, 2018.\u00a0 The substation was last examined and tested on January 20, 2018.\u00a0 No hazards or violations were reported in the examination record.Training and Experience\nWhitlock had 21 years of total mining experience, approximately eleven of which were in highwall mining.\u00a0 He began working at the SHM52 Highwall Miner on June 12, 2017, as the forklift loader operator.\u00a0 Additionally, he operated all equipment as needed, including the mining machine.MSHA\u2019s EFSMS determined that Whitlock was up-to-date in his experienced miner training, which he received on June 12, 2017, as well as in his task training for the forklift loader, front-end loader, and the mining machine, which he received on June 13, 2017.\u00a0Whitlock also received an electrical certification from the State of West Virginia on June 15, 2007, for a Class 26 low, medium, and high voltage classification, however, his certification expired December 31, 2016. \u00a0Therefore, Whitlock was not certified by the State of West Virginia as an electrician at the time of the accident. \u00a0Also, Whitlock was not qualified by MSHA to perform electrical work at the time of the accident because he had not certified to the District Manager that he had completed an electrical retraining program.\u00a0 MSHA Regulations, Title 30 CFR, Part 77.103(g), states:An individual qualified in accordance with this section shall, in order to retain qualification, certify annually to the District Manager, that he has satisfactorily completed a coal mine electrical retraining program approved by the Secretary.Electrical Troubleshooting and Electrical WorkText messages on Whitlock\u2019s personal cell phone indicate K. Owens provided advice on troubleshooting and electrical repair being done approximately 15 minutes before the accident. \u00a0Cassell and Harvey assisted Whitlock in making a repair to the trailing cable prior to the accident, and Harvey also stated he had observed Whitlock working on electrical control systems on other days.Hand tools and repair materials (i.e. electrical tape, pliers, screwdrivers, plastic zip ties, and a Fluke\u00ae multimeter) were found lying on the floor and on top of the back-up ground fault system access panel inside the onboard transformer compartment (see Appendix B). \u00a0The meter was turned off but had the test leads deployed. \u00a0One of the back-up ground fault transformers had a broken mounting bracket and was hanging by the wiring. \u00a0Investigators could not determine if this condition was present before the accident or was caused by the accident.Whitlock did not personally lock and tag out the trailing cable at the substation that supplies 7,200 VAC to the mining machine. \u00a0In response to Whitlock\u2019s request, Hartley traveled to the high voltage substation and disconnected the power to the trailing cable to allow Whitlock to perform repairs. \u00a0Hartley stated that he opened the visual disconnect for the trailing cable and used a flashlight to confirm all three blades of the switch were open. \u00a0He then sent a text to Whitlock\u2019s personal cell phone confirming the power was disconnected. \u00a0He waited at the substation and, when Whitlock texted him to turn the power back on, he reenergized the trailing cable. \u00a0Whitlock sent a text message instructing him to remain at the substation.Title 30 CFR \u00a7 77.501 requires that electrical work only be performed by a qualified person or by a person \u201ctrained to perform electrical work and to maintain electrical work under the direct supervision of a qualified person.\u201d\u00a0 In addition, the regulation provides that disconnecting devices must be locked and tagged, and the only persons who are permitted to do this are those doing the work.\u00a0 Lastly, the lock and tag can only be removed by the person who installed them. \u00a0If that person is unavailable, the mine operator or his agent can authorize persons to remove them. \u00a0K. Owens and Hartley were both aware that the victim was no longer certified to do electrical troubleshooting and/or electrical work, but they directed, discussed, and allowed him to do electrical troubleshooting and electrical work.\u00a0 The victim had been performing electrical troubleshooting and electrical work prior to this accident when he was no longer certified to do so.\u00a0 Bundy and K. Owens told investigators that Whitlock was not certified to do electrical troubleshooting and/or electrical work.\u00a0 Also, Whitlock was not on the mine operator\u2019s list of certified and qualified persons required by 30 CFR \u00a7 77.106.In addition, Hartley knew that Whitlock had not personally locked and tagged the 7,200 VAC circuit before the victim performed electrical work on that circuit.\u00a0 Hartley had first-hand knowledge of this because, as indicated by his testimony and text messages, he deenergized the 7,200 VAC electrical circuit for Whitlock. \u00a0Hartley also knew that Whitlock had not personally removed his lock and tag prior to the 7,200 VAC circuit being reenergized, because Hartley removed the lock and tag and reenergized the circuit for him.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 A root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the investigation and the operator\u2019s implemented corrective actions to prevent a reoccurrence of this type of accident.Root Cause: \u00a0The mine operator did not perform test and repair work on electrical equipment and circuitry in a safe manner.\u00a0 The mine operator did not use proper lock out/tag out procedures.Corrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator developed and implemented an action plan to prevent similar occurrences. \u00a0This plan includes controls to ensure:Only qualified personnel perform electrical work;\nMiners receive additional training on electrical testing and repair;\nThe installation of safety features on electrical equipment. \u00a0The safety features include lid switches wired into the ground monitor circuit, a grounding bar on the load break switch for the three phases of the high voltage transformers, and an additional external visible vacuum disconnect, which will also interrupt the ground monitor circuit causing the substation to remove power on the trailing cable; and\nProper lock /tag out procedures.\nThe mine operator incorporated the provisions of the action plan into the training and ground control plans for this mine. \u00a0All miners were trained in these new company policies.", "CONCLUSION": "On Wednesday, February 21, 2018, at approximately 5:15 p.m., James A. Whitlock, a 38-year old Highwall Mining Machine Operator with approximately 21 years of total mining experience, was electrocuted when he came into contact with an energized connection of a 7,200 VAC electrical circuit.\u00a0 He was found inside the onboard high voltage transformer compartment that supplies power to the mining machine.\u00a0 He had entered the compartment to troubleshoot and/or perform electrical work on the circuit.The accident occurred because the operator did not ensure the safe operation, testing, and repair of electrical equipment and circuitry, including use of proper lock out/tag out procedures.\u00a0 Mine management was aware that Whitlock\u2019s electrician certification had expired, and therefore, he was precluded from performing electrical work by State and Federal regulations.\u00a0 However, mine management advised, directed, and assisted him in performing electrical work at the mine.Approved By:\u00a0\u00a0__________________________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ________________Brian M.

"On Monday, February 5, 2018, Leonard Griffith started his shift at 11:00 p.m.\u00a0 He \u00a0was assigned to perform routine maintenance on the continuous mining machine on the left side of the section.\u00a0 Griffith performed this task before and regularly worked in 3-Section.\u00a0 He rode with other miners in a diesel-powered personnel carrier to 3-Section, arriving at 11:56 p.m.\u00a0 Griffith walked to the tool car and then to the continuous mining machine located in the No. 1 entry. \u00a0Earl Moats, Section Foreman, was conducting his initial examination of the section and briefly spoke to Griffith as he passed by the continuous mining machine at approximately 12:10 a.m.Jason Harris, Dale Tenney, and Richard Chambers, Electricians, also regularly worked on 3-Section. \u00a0Harris and Tenney were also assigned to repair a broken conveyor chain on the continuous mining machine on the right side of the section.\u00a0 Chambers initially helped Harris and Tenney \u00a0find crib blocks to support the cutting head, before he went to help Griffith.Chambers walked toward the left side of the section to help Griffith but was redirected by John Payne, Contractor Crew Leader, to repair a scoop.\u00a0 Chambers contacted Frank Mullenax, Outby Electrician, to assist him in troubleshooting the scoop. \u00a0At approximately 1:30 a.m., Mullenax arrived at the scoop.The mine-wide tracking system shows that between 12:00 a.m. and 1:15 a.m., Griffith made several trips to the tool car and back to the continuous mining machine. \u00a0\u00a0Harris briefly spoke to Griffith at approximately 1:10 a.m.\u00a0 After that, no one had contact with Griffith.\u00a0 At approximately 3:45 a.m., Ben Poling, Maintenance Foreman/Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), and Harvey Glotfelty, Assistant Maintenance Superintendent, were walking across the section and discovered Griffith under the rib.Poling and Glotfelty initially tried to move the large piece of rib on top of Griffith, without success.\u00a0 Poling then went to find help, and Glotfelty stayed with Griffith, removing smaller pieces of the rib that had fallen on him. \u00a0Poling found \u00a0Mullenax and Chambers and directed them to go to the accident scene.\u00a0 Poling continued across the section and contacted Moats who notified Anthony Moran, Dispatcher.\u00a0 Moran called 911 at 3:53 a.m.Mullenax and Chambers arrived at the scene and helped Glotfelty remove the large piece of rib from Griffith (see Appendix A).\u00a0 They moved him away from the unstable rib to the rear of the continuous mining machine, a safe location.\u00a0 Poling and Glotfelty checked Griffith\u2019s vital signs; no pulse was detected. \u00a0They placed him on a backboard and carried him to a 4-person

Center notified Steve Stankus, Bridgeport Field Office Supervisor, who contacted mine officials and notified them of their responsibility to preserve the accident scene.\u00a0 Mike Stark, Staff Assistant, assigned Michael Fasouletos, Coal Mine Safety and Health Specialist, Roof Control, and Ronald Postalwait, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, to investigate the accident.\u00a0 Postalwait arrived at the mine at approximately 6:45 a.m.\u00a0 He issued a \u00a0103(k) order to prevent the destruction of any evidence which would assist in investigating the cause or causes of the accident and to assure the safety of all persons at this operation.\u00a0The accident investigation was conducted in conjunction with the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST) and Wolf Run Mining LLC. \u00a0The team conducted preliminary interviews with persons having knowledge of the facts and circumstances concerning the accident before going underground.The investigation team traveled to 3-Section, took photographs and measurements at the accident site (see Appendix B), and developed a sketch of the area where Griffith was found (see Appendix C).On February 8, 2018, Fasouletos travelled to the location of the accident with Mike Gauna, Mining Engineer, and Ryan Stephan, Mechanical Engineer, both from MSHA Technical Support.\u00a0 They evaluated the accident site and rib conditions.On February 13, 2018, the investigation team conducted formal interviews at the WVOMHST Westover Office.\u00a0 A list of persons who were interviewed and who participated in the accident investigation is in Appendix D.", "DISCUSSION": "Accident Site\nThe accident took place in the No. 1 entry just outby the No. 16 crosscut on 3-Section. \u00a0The entry was mined uphill at a 15 percent grade from the No. 15 crosscut to follow a change in the orientation of the coal seam.\u00a0 The original mine entry at the accident site was approximately 7 feet high by 18 feet wide. \u00a0The average width at the accident site after the rib roll occurred was 18.9 feet.\u00a0 The depth of cover was approximately 700 feet with no overmining or undermining in the vicinity.The fallen rib measured approximately 18 feet long by 7 feet high and up to 14 inches thick.\u00a0 The fallen rib material had a fragmented texture with slabs and blocks of varying sizes.\u00a0 The large portion of the rib removed from on top of Griffith was 36 to 42 inches long by 28 inches high and up to 14 inches thick.The rib roll occurred because of geologic features that were difficult to see.\u00a0 These features became apparent during the investigation.\u00a0 The rib was weakened by the interaction of coal cleats, inconsistent rock partings scattered within the seam, and barely perceptible small discontinuous slickenside structures, along with the normal pillar surface yielding after an area has been mined.Roof Control Plan\nThe operator\u2019s approved roof control plan required rib bolt installation in the conveyor belt entry where heights are greater than 72 inches.\u00a0 This fatality occurred in the No. 1 entry, not the conveyor belt entry.\u00a0 Additionally, all pillar corners are required to be rib bolted with \u00be-inch-diameter, 4-foot-long fully- grouted fixtures with suitable bearing plates.\u00a0 There were three to four rib bolts installed within five feet of each pillar corner on 3-Section and the conveyor belt entry was rib bolted.\u00a0 Investigators found that the mine operator had complied with the approved roof control plan at the scene of the accident.Examinations\nA review of the pre-shift and on-shift records for examinations made prior to the accident indicate mine examiners did not report any adverse rib conditions.\u00a0 Moats also stated he did not observe adverse rib conditions when he traveled between the left side of the continuous mining machine and the solid coal rib during his initial examination.\u00a0 Interviews with miners and mine management revealed it was common practice for persons to identify hazardous rib conditions and scale ribs throughout the active mining sections.\u00a0Training Records\nWilliam Roberts, MSHA Training Specialist, reviewed the training records for Griffith.\u00a0 Griffith had been employed at this mine since January 5, 2015, and his last annual refresher training was conducted on January 6, 2018. \u00a0Griffith had received his required task training; however, the documentation was incomplete.\u00a0 MSHA issued eight non-contributory citations for inadequate documentation of task training.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 A root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the investigation and the operator\u2019s implemented corrective action to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident.Root Cause: \u00a0The rib support system used at the mine was not adequate for the geologic conditions at the location of the accident.Corrective Action: The mine operator revised the roof control plan to require the installation of rib bolts in all entries on development.", "CONCLUSION": "On Tuesday, February 6, 2018, Leonard Griffith, a 52-year-old electrician with over\n13 years of mining experience, was fatally injured as a result of a rib roll.\u00a0 On the day of the accident, he was assigned to perform routine maintenance on a continuous mining machine.\u00a0 He was discovered at approximately 3:45 a.m., pinned under a large section of rib adjacent to the continuous mining machine in the place where he had been working.\u00a0 There were no witnesses to the accident.The fatal accident was a result of the coal ribs not being effectively controlled in the work area.\u00a0 The rib support system used at this mine was not adequate for the geologic conditions.\u00a0Signed

When either of these two controls is used, both the left and right side brakes apply and release together.\u00a0 Due to the extensive damage the bulldozer received during the accident, investigators were unable to conduct a brake function test.Maintenance RecordsThe Caterpillar D-9T was inspected by WVOMHST on December 18, 2017, and it issued five violations for the following conditions: 1) portable fire extinguisher was discharged; 2) lower windshield wiper on left side was bent; 3) four lights were not working; 4) the left boarding step was missing; and 5) the left handrail was bent.Investigators discovered that the D-9T bulldozer was out of service during the day-shift of December 28, 2017, because of a ruptured hydraulic hose. \u00a0The hydraulic hoses were replaced and the machine was put back in service on the evening shift.\u00a0 All of the defects where repaired, and the state inspector noted on December 28, 2017, that the conditions giving rise to the violations had been abated.Push PracticesDotson stated in his formal interview that before the accident, Thurman Watts was establishing a roadway into the previously blasted material to allow the loader and rock trucks access into the pit. \u00a0He was pushing material into the push path of the D-11 bulldozer, and then Dotson would push the material over the highwall. \u00a0Evidence gathered at the accident site and interviews reveal that at the time of the accident, both bulldozers were operating perpendicular to the highwall, pushing the material out and over the highwall.Statements gathered during interviews revealed that bulldozer operators were instructed by the company foreman to leave one blade of material on top of the highwall and push that material over with the next blade of material.\u00a0 This was called the two blade technique but this technique was not included in the ground control plan or any other written company policy or procedure.\u00a0 The equipment operators interviewed stated this was discussed regularly in safety meetings.\u00a0 Investigators could not determine if the victim was using the two blade technique at the time of the accident.When ground conditions are irregular, pushed material can be continuously deposited in the push path of the bulldozer and/or at the edge of the highwall.\u00a0 The bulldozer can then travel on top of this material or spoil where this unconsolidated spoil can create unstable conditions near the highwall.Investigators determined that the ground conditions where the victim was working were irregular.\u00a0 The bulldozer operated by Thurman Watts traveled onto an area of unstable spoil that had deposited on the top of the highwall.\u00a0 Because of this, the bulldozer was not being operated a safe distance from the edge.\u00a0 The spoil slipped down the highwall face under the bulldozer, causing it to go over the highwall.\u00a0Ground Control PlanThe ground control plan was acknowledged on August 14, 2008; a revision to the ground control plan was received on December 14, 2017, and acknowledged on January 4, 2018. \u00a0This update added a highwall mining machine to the ground control plan. There were no safety precautions in the updated ground control plan that addressed bulldozers pushing material over highwalls.\u00a0 The mine operator was in compliance with the ground control plan at the time of the accident.\u00a0 Since the \u201ctwo blade\u201d technique was discussed with miners, a noncontributory citation was issued for a violation of \u00a7 77.1000 because the technique was not listed in the ground control plan.Weather ConditionsWeather was not a factor in the accident.\u00a0 It was clear, with cold temperature, no fog or precipitation at time of accident.\u00a0 The snow shown in the accident photos fell after the accident had occurred.ExaminationsThe pre-shift and on-shift examinations conducted on December 28, 2017, by Tyrone Watts indicated there were no hazards observed for the highwalls or working pits.The pre-shift examination conducted by Calhoun indicated there were no hazards observed for the highwalls or working pits.\u00a0 Calhoun had not yet completed his on-shift examination at the time the accident.The pre-operational examination conducted on the Caterpillar D-9T bulldozer on December 28, 2017, revealed no safety defects.\u00a0 The examinations conducted on December 26, 2017, indicated a manifold leak found on the evening shift, and the day shift exam indicated a right jack light out.\u00a0 Those defects were corrected prior to the accident.Training and ExperienceThurman Watts received his miner certification on July 11, 2007, and his surface mine foreman card on May 26, 2010. \u00a0He received experienced miner training on December 6, 2017, and Calhoun conducted this training. \u00a0According to Calhoun, Thurman Watts was current with his annual refresher training.\u00a0 Calhoun also informed investigators that his experienced miner training consisted of discussions of health and safety aspects of the job, hazards that may be encountered on the job, tasks he would be assigned to perform, a tour of the mine property, communications, and first aid kit locations.Task training was conducted by Calhoun on December 6, 2017, on both the Caterpillar D-9T and the Caterpillar D-11. At the training, Calhoun asked Thurman Watts about his past experience, and was told he had been operating bulldozers for several years at other surface mines. \u00a0Calhoun observed Thurman Watts conducting a pre-operational check and operating the machines.\u00a0 Calhoun also observed Thurman Watts using the two blade technique in the Winifrede Ryder pit.\u00a0 Additionally, Calhoun discussed the two blade technique with Watts and Dotson during prior shifts at this mine.\u00a0 Investigators found that the training was completed in accordance with the requirements of 30 CFR Part 48.As previously stated, the mine operator regularly discussed the two-blade technique in safety meetings.\u00a0 The victim would have attended these safety meetings.\u00a0 Also, Dotson stated that the victim worked in this area of the mine along with him for several shifts.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \u00a0A root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the investigation and the operator\u2019s implemented corrective action to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident:Root Cause:\u00a0 The policies and procedures used by the mine operator did not ensure that safe working conditions were provided for the employees at all times. \u00a0The ground conditions were irregular and caused the bulldozer to travel onto an area of unstable spoil that had deposited on the top of the highwall.\u00a0 Because of this, the bulldozer was not being operated a safe distance from the edge.\u00a0 The spoil slipped down the highwall face under the bulldozer, causing it to go over the highwall.\u00a0Corrective Action: \u00a0The mine operator developed a procedure and added it as a revision to its ground control plan to prevent a similar occurrence of this accident. \u00a0The ground control plan was revised to require that equipment used to push material over elevated highwalls employ the \u201ctwo blade\u201d method of pushing (one blade of material will be left at the edge and pushed over with the following blade of material).Additionally, the company added a procedure to address irregular ground conditions and/or highwalls.\u00a0 The mine operator will conduct a pre-shift examination and an on-shift examination every four hours.\u00a0 The examination will include observations and evaluations of the ground conditions and highwall edge. \u00a0Any hazardous condition, such as a highwall overhang, broken highwall edge, or unconsolidated material, that could fail and cause equipment to travel over the highwall, will be reported. \u00a0All hazardous areas found will be dangered off to prevent exposure to the hazard.\u00a0 No bulldozers will be allowed to push material in those areas until the hazards are eliminated.All bulldozer operators were trained in the revised ground control plan.\u00a0 The plan also requires training to be provided to new employees concerning the revised ground control plan and hazards associated with operating equipment while pushing materials over the edge of highwalls.", "CONCLUSION": "On Friday, December 29, 2017, at approximately 12:57 a.m., Thurman Watts, a 34-year-old bulldozer operator with 10 years of mining experience, was fatally injured when the Caterpillar D-9T bulldozer he was operating traveled over a highwall.\u00a0 The bulldozer dropped approximately 100 feet and continued down the spoil bank, coming to rest approximately 400 feet from the top of the highwall. At the time of the accident, Thurman Watts was removing overburden from a coal seam.The fatal accident occurred because safe work practices were not followed.\u00a0 The ground conditions where the victim was working were irregular.\u00a0 The bulldozer operated by Thurman Watts traveled onto an area of unstable spoil on the top of the highwall.\u00a0 Because of this, the bulldozer was not being operated a safe distance from the edge.\u00a0 The spoil slipped down the highwall face under the bulldozer, causing it to go over the highwall.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Approved by:\u00a0_____________________________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 _____________________Scott Mandeville\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 DateDistrict Manager\u00a0", "ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS": "A section 103(k) order no. 9118501 was issued on December 29, 2017, to Black Jewell, LLC.\nA fatal accident occurred at this operation on December 29, 2017, at 12:57 a.m., when a miner went over a highwall in a Caterpillar D-9 bulldozer.This 103k order is issued to assure the safety of all persons at this operation and to preserve any evidence to aid in the investigation.

"DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On October 23, 2017, James Adkins started his shift at 3:50 a.m. by checking in with Randy Stover, Mine Dispatcher. \u00a0Adkins had a short conversation with Stover before collecting his multi-gas detector and radio and going to work.\u00a0 As a mine examiner/belt man, he performed maintenance and cleaning on his assigned conveyor belts and addressed any hazardous conditions recorded in the mine examination books.\u00a0 Between 4:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m., he would have conducted examinations to determine airflow direction, methane and oxygen quantities, and the presence of any hazardous conditions, as well as any violations of mandatory standards. \u00a0He then would have recorded the results in the examination book located in the mine office.The mine tracking system shows that at 4:10 a.m., Adkins recorded the date, time, and his initials (DTIs) at the date board located at the No. 1 belt drive outside the mine belt portal.\u00a0 He then entered the mine and traveled along the conveyor belt, recording his DTIs at successive date boards. \u00a0At 4:26 a.m., his final DTIs were recorded at the off-side of the No. 1 belt across from the No. 2 belt junction point. \u00a0His DTIs were not recorded on the next date board, which was directly across the belt on the walkway side (see Appendix B).At about the same time, Gary Hastings and Joseph Varette, Owl Shift Examiners and Belt Men, were checking for bad belt splices at the No. 5A belt drive. \u00a0They called to ask Stover, the dispatcher, to turn on the No. 1 to No. 5A belts and run them from outside. \u00a0Stover warned miners by radio, calling \u201cbelts coming on\u201d four times before starting the belts. \u00a0The computer system shows that the No. 1 beltline started at 4:28:23 a.m., about two minutes after Adkins left his final DTIs.At 6:03 a.m., the overland belt transfer system was started up and coal was loaded onto the belt system from the belt stacker tube stock pile by a bulldozer.\u00a0 After 6:30 a.m., Jesse Smith, Owl Shift Mine Examiner, noticed that the personnel carrier driven by Adkins was parked outby the No. 2 belt head along the No. 1 beltline.\u00a0 Smith walked over to the beltline and called for Adkins.\u00a0 When he received no answer, he called Stout to ask where Adkins was located.\u00a0 Stout stated that the tracking system showed Adkins was on the surface.\u00a0When Smith recorded the results of his examination in the record book, he noticed that Adkins had not filled out his examination record.\u00a0 Shortly before 7:00 a.m., Smith asked at the examiner\u2019s office if anyone had seen Adkins.\u00a0 No one had, so Smith informed Thomas Hess, General Mine Forman, and together they started to look outside and then underground for Adkins.\u00a0 Smith found the hard hat belonging to Adkins on the mine floor at the belt airlock at No. 3 break. \u00a0He ran outside and called on the radio to shut all the mine belts off. \u00a0At 7:04:27 a.m., David Stout, Mine Dispatcher for the day shift, shut down the beltlines.Smith proceeded to check the feeder area at the belt stacker tube, where the No. 1 conveyor belt ended. \u00a0He found the cap light worn by Adkins on the ground beside the transfer belt. \u00a0Smith then traveled along the transfer conveyor belt to the Horse Creek No. 12 transfer point located across from the Allen Powellton Mine, looking for signs of Adkins.At about 7:09 a.m., Stout notified the Marfork Preparation Plant, Brushy Eagle Mine, Coon Cedar Grove Mine, Slip Ridge Cedar Grove Mine, and the Allen Powellton Mine to shut down their belts and to start looking for a missing miner.\u00a0 He also called the Whitesville Ambulance service at 7:22 a.m., and an ambulance arrived at the mine at 8:15 a.m.Miners from the underground Horse Creek Eagle Mine, Slip Ridge Cedar Grove Mine, Coon Cedar Grove Mine and the Marfork Preparation Plant traveled all of the conveyor belts and associated belt transfers looking for signs of the missing mine examiner.\u00a0 Adkins was found at 10:44 a.m. as excavators dug coal out from around the No. 3 raw coal stacker tube at the Marfork Preparation Plant.\u00a0 His location indicated that he had been transported 7.2 miles from the No. 1 conveyor belt to the plant.\u00a0Adkins was recovered by company Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), Rob Asbury, Dave Green, Adam Sipes, Kelton Cozart, Brian Jarrell, and Shannon Dickens, and taken to a Whitesville Fire and Emergency Medical Services ambulance. \u00a0At 11:00 a.m., the ambulance left the property and transported Adkins to the fire department, where he was pronounced dead by State of West Virginia Medical Examiner, Teddy Yeager.", "INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT": "On October 23, 2017, at 7:12 a.m., Stout, Mine Dispatcher, called the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center to report the accident. \u00a0At 7:32 a.m., the DOL Contact Center notified Donald Phillips, Conference and Litigation Representative, who informed Lincoln Selfe, Assistant District Manager.\u00a0 Selfe contacted Delbert Harper, Mine Superintendent, to inform him of the operator\u2019s obligation to preserve the accident scene.\u00a0 Selfe assigned Larry Hedrick and John Stone, Jr., Coal Mine Safety & Health Inspectors (Electrical)/Accident Investigators, to investigate the accident.\u00a0 Hedrick and Stone traveled to the mine and Hedrick issued a 103(k) order to protect miners and to prevent the destruction of any evidence.The accident investigation was conducted in conjunction with the West Virginia Office of Miner\u2019s Health, Safety, and Training (WVOMHST), mine management, and employees at the mine.\u00a0 Investigators obtained statements from persons having knowledge of the facts and circumstances concerning the accident, retrieved information from the mine\u2019s tracking and communications system, and photographed, sketched, and surveyed the accident scene.On October 27, 2017, MSHA and WVOMHST jointly conducted formal interviews at the office of the WVOMHST office in Oak Hill, WV. \u00a0Persons who participated in the investigation are listed in Appendix C.\u00a0", "DISCUSSION": "Adkins Work ScheduleEleven weeks prior to the accident, Adkins assisted the midnight shift with pre-shift examinations.\u00a0 He started his shift about 4:00 a.m. and conducted examinations of the belts, track, and electrical installations along the No. 1, 2, and 3 belt conveyors for the on-coming day shift. \u00a0This was in addition to his normal mine examiner duties on the day shift.Accident SiteThere were no witnesses to the accident.\u00a0 However, the mine tracking system, the sequence of date board signatures, and other physical evidence indicated to the investigators that the following happened:Adkins parked his personnel carrier at the No. 9 crosscut on the No. 1 conveyor belt and traveled on foot to conduct the rest of his examinations. \u00a0He traveled along the No. 1 conveyor belt from the No. 9 crosscut to the No. 11 crosscut, where he placed his DTI on the date board and checked the two power centers.\u00a0 He then used the crossunder at surveyor spad 6658 and walked behind the guard at the No. 2 belt drive and take-up unit, where he examined the offside of the No. 2 belt drive (see Appendix B).After Adkins placed his DTI on the offside date board, he attempted to cross the No. 1 conveyor belt at the No. 1 conveyor belt tailpiece rather than returning to the crossunder, which was 95 feet away. As he attempted to cross, he fell onto the No. 1 belt at approximately the same time that the conveyor belt was started up. Adkins was then transported on the No. 1 conveyor belt out of the mine.Investigators examined the accident area and tested the No. 1 belt drive and belts, as well as the belt start and stop switches and belt drive at the No. 2 belt transfer. \u00a0The investigators determined that the belt controls were working properly.Remote Belt Start ProcedureWhen the accident occurred, all miners located near the outby belts, including Adkins, had two-way radios.\u00a0 Before starting the No. 1 through No. 5A belts at about 4:30 a.m., Stover, the dispatcher, used the outby radio channel to inform miners that the belts were getting ready to start.\u00a0 In his interview, Stover said that no outby miner responded before he started the belts, and he did not expect anyone to do so unless they noticed a hazard.Mine Examination PracticesThe belt examiners at the mine utilized three-wheeled, battery-operated personnel carriers to conduct the majority of the conveyor belt examinations. \u00a0They travelled along the wide side of the conveyor belt where possible and examined the areas around belt heads on foot. \u00a0They examined both sides of the belt at transfer points and recorded their DTIs at all locations. \u00a0In order to cross the belts, examiners were supposed to use crossunders located at the rear of the belt drives or crossovers available at the outby end of the belt junction points. \u00a0Mine Tracking SystemThe mine uses an MSHA approved tracking system manufactured by Pyott Boone Electronics (PBE) Group.\u00a0 Miners wear or carry tracking devices in pouches so their locations can be tracked.\u00a0 The devices transmit a signal, and receivers throughout the mine receive the signal and provide the miner\u2019s location to a system computer.\u00a0 The computer retains a log of the information from each receiver for a period of two weeks.The tracking system log shows that Adkins was at the No. 2 belt transfer at 4:29 a.m.\u00a0 At 4:30 a.m., Adkins\u2019 location was picked up by a receiver on the surface.\u00a0 This tracking indicates that Adkins attempted to cross the conveyor belt just outby the No. 2 belt rock box, fell onto the conveyor, and was carried outside. \u00a0Adkins\u2019 device signal was tracked from the No. 9 belt drive between the Slip Ridge Cedar Grove mine and the Coon Cedar Groove mine on the conveyor belt system, to the No. 8 belt drive and the No. 7 belt drive in the Coon Cedar Grove Mine, where the signal was lost. \u00a0This indicates that the conveyor system carried Adkins to the surface when that operation started at 6:03 a.m. and through the series of underground mines to the processing plant, 7.2 miles away.\u00a0 The tracking device was not recovered.No. 2 Belt Transfer and No. 1 BeltThe No. 2 belt transfer, near where Adkins fell, was constructed with four-foot by eight-foot sheets of metal plating welded together to form a steel chute with angled deflector walls.\u00a0 This steel chute, called a \u201crock box,\u201d funneled mined material onto the No. 1 conveyor belt to minimize spillage. \u00a0At this location, there were 37 \u00bd inches of clearance between the belt and the roof.Investigators found smudges and chalk marks on the roof bolt plates above the belt directly in front of the rock box.\u00a0 This indicated that the plates had been used as handholds while the examiners crossed the belt. \u00a0The tracks indicated that the examiners stepped up on a water line lying beside the belt structure, stood on the belt structure, reached over to the roof bolt plates, and stepped across the conveyor belt onto the opposite belt structure and the ground. \u00a0This crossing was apparently used as a shortcut instead of the nearest crossunder, which was 95 feet away (see Appendix B).The belt was suspended from the roof by chains spaced every ten feet for the entire length of the belt. \u00a0The clearance between the roof and the belt was as small as twenty inches, making it extremely difficult for a miner to exit the fast-moving belt after falling.The No. 2 belt transfer was well illuminated so that mine examiners could see the area.\u00a0 Start and stop controls were present at the portal, behind the take-up unit and at the nine and 12 breaks.\u00a0 The start and stop controls functioned properly and could be accessed from both sides of the conveyor belt.Experience and TrainingAdkins began his employment at the Horse Creek Mine in February of 2016, as a mine examiner and belt man.\u00a0 A review of Adkins\u2019 training records showed he received experienced miner training on February 29, 2016, annual refresher training in March of 2016 and 2017, and certified person training on April 29, 2017.\u00a0 Adkins received his underground mine foreman certification from the State of West Virginia on March 25, 2011.\u00a0 He was certified as an emergency medical technician (EMT) on December 28, 2016.\u00a0 Adkins\u2019 training was up to date and in compliance with Part 48 of the CFR.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 A root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.\u00a0Listed below is the root cause identified during the investigation and the operator\u2019s implemented corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident:1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Root Cause: \u00a0Proper safety procedures were not followed while performing a conveyor belt examination.Corrective Action: The mine operator installed belt crossovers at all belt transfer points. \u00a0These crossovers are located at the belt tailpieces and prevent the use of belt tailpieces as a means to cross the belts.\u00a0 All crossovers, mid-belt crossovers, and crossunders were evaluated and modified, relocated, added or removed as appropriate.\u00a0 All miners were trained to use these suitable belt crossing facilities.Also, the mine operator installed a visual and audible pre-start alarm at each underground tailpiece, which alarms 10 seconds before the startup of the belt, as well as lights along the No. 1 conveyor belt and pull cord plugs at each remote belt switch along the conveyor belt. \u00a0These plugs are hung across the conveyor belt so that a person can reach them to stop the belt.\u00a0", "CONCLUSION": "On October 23, 2017, at approximately 4:29 a.m., James R. Adkins, a 48-year-old mine examiner with 18 years of mining experience fell onto a moving conveyor belt and received fatal injuries.\u00a0 Adkins was attempting to cross the conveyor belt at the tailpiece in order to complete his examination of the belt, when he fell.\u00a0 He had been assigned to conduct a pre-shift examination of the No. 1, 2, and 3 conveyor belts, electrical boxes and track entry of the Horse Creek Eagle mine for the day shift.The accident occurred because the operator did not follow proper safety procedures.Approved by:\u00a0\u00a0--------------------------------------------------------\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ------------------------------David S.

Chesney, a 20-year old plant operator, was fatally injured on September 5, 2017, while working near an operating belt conveyor.\u00a0 The victim was found beneath the hopper entangled in the tail pulley of the short feed conveyor.The accident occurred because the mine operator did not: (1) have a guard secured in place prior to operating the conveyor; (2) provide appropriate task training to the victim so he understood the hazards associated with the work being performed; and (3) conduct adequate workplace examinations to identify hazards so appropriate corrective actions could be taken.\u2003", "GENERAL INFORMATION": "Emery Pit, a surface construction sand and gravel mine owned and operated by G S Materials Inc., is located in Candor, Montgomery County, North Carolina.\u00a0 The principal operating official is Ronnie G. Kirkpatrick Sr., President.\u00a0 The mine regularly operates one 10-hour shift per day, five days per week.\u00a0 The mine typically operates a partial shift on Saturday and frequently operates on Sunday as well.\u00a0 Total employment is 17 persons.Excavators extract material from the pit and load it into haul trucks for transport to two processing locations, the CDE and Kolberg plants.\u00a0 Machinery washes and screens the material and then conveys it into stockpiles.\u00a0 The operator sells the finished products for use in a variety of construction industries, including golf course development.\u00a0 The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on June 21, 2017.", "DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On September 5, 2017, Dillon P. Chesney (victim) reported to work at 7:00 a.m., his normal starting time.\u00a0 Mine manager Scott Kirkpatrick and mine superintendent Sammy Reagan talked with miners gathered in the parking lot about personnel issues and then discussed plans for the day.Because the CDE plant was scheduled to be shut down for maintenance, Reagan told Kirkpatrick to make certain someone started the water pumps so the Kolberg plant could operate.\u00a0 Chesney was assigned that task, which he completed by 9:30 a.m.\u00a0 He then arrived at the Kolberg plant shortly before 10:00 a.m.Michael Everett, floater, was operating a front-end loader in the Kolberg plant area, pushing up sand dumped by haul trucks from the pit into a stockpile.\u00a0 Everett planned to load the feed chute once Chesney arrived to start it.\u00a0 Around 10:00 a.m., Michael Bowden, a loader operator normally assigned to feed material, arrived to relieve Everett so he could load customer trucks by the CDE plant.Bowden and Chesney installed screws in the skirt rubber on the short feed conveyor beneath the feed hopper.\u00a0 Chesney told Bowden he was going to the CDE plant to help with repairs after he made sure everything was running properly at the Kolberg plant.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Chesney started the Kolberg plant from the control room, and Bowden dumped material in the feed hopper for approximately ten minutes until he was replaced by Gilbert Chavez, the loader operator normally assigned to the CDE plant.\u00a0 Bowden left the area at 10:30 a.m. to operate an excavator. \u00a0Bowden returned to the Kolberg plant at 11:17 a.m., and saw Chesney\u2019s pickup truck still parked by the plant.\u00a0 Chavez was still loading material in the feed hopper and the plant was producing material.\u00a0 Bowden started looking for Chesney and found him beneath the hopper entangled in the tail pulley of the short feed conveyor.\u00a0 Bowden called Kirkpatrick and was told to call Monica Bruce at the scale house.\u00a0 Bruce called 911 at 11:23 a.m.\u00a0 Kirkpatrick called Reagan at approximately 11:30 a.m. and told him Chesney \u201cwas in trouble\u201d.\u00a0 The first EMS responders arrived at 11:39 a.m. and medical examiner Andy Sanders pronounced Chesney dead at 11:41 a.m.The medical examiner attributed the cause of death to multiple blunt force traumas to head and torso.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "Monica Bruce, Scale House Operator, called the Department of Labor\u2019s National Contact Center (DOLNCC) at 11:53 a.m. on September 5, 2017.\u00a0 The DOLNCC contacted Michael Evans, Safety Specialist, Southeastern District, and MSHA immediately began an investigation.MSHA initially issued an order pursuant to Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act), as amended.\u00a0 The agency subsequently modified the order to a Section 103(k) order upon arrival of an Authorized Representative.MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, and reviewed training and work procedures relevant to the accident. \u00a0MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of North Carolina Department of Labor and mine management.\u00a0 There were no eye witnesses to the accident.", "DISCUSSION": "LocationThe accident occurred beneath the Kolberg plant feed hopper at the tail section of the short feed conveyor.Investigators found the tail pulley guard on the floor underneath the conveyor, approximately 6 feet in front of the tail pulley.\u00a0 Someone had removed both the tail pulley and head pulley guards.\u00a0 Investigators learned the guarding had been removed to replace the belt and rollers six days prior to the accident and that the operator used the conveyor for production for three days without replacing the guarding.\u00a0 The tail pulley guard was equipped with slots cut out on the back so belt tracking adjustments could be performed with the guard secured in place and therefore there was no reason to remove the guard to make an adjustment.\u00a0Investigators found a light weight, portable, aluminum work platform below and slightly behind the victim; tipped over backwards with the standing surface facing the opposite direction of the conveyor. \u00a0The platform was 39\u00bd inches long and 12 inches wide, and, when upright, measured 20 inches tall.\u00a0 Investigators noted that Chesney appeared to have been standing on the platform when the accident occurred, based upon the height of the conveyor from the ground.\u00a0 Investigators believe Chesney was working by the right side of the conveyor in front of the tail pulley.\u00a0 When EMS arrived, they found his feet suspended above the floor approximately 6 inches, and observed a crescent wrench on the floor beneath the conveyor; the tool was bent to the curvature of the drum.The right side pillow block bearing that supports the shaft to the frame rail was completely removed and the left side was loosened from the frame.\u00a0 The conveyor belt was slack but intact and not separated.\u00a0 EMS responders had to disconnect the pulley shaft from the right side and shift it off of the frame rail in order to extract the victim\u2019s body.ConveyorThe investigation team was unable to determine the manufacturer of the short feed conveyor. \u00a0The feed conveyor is powered by a Baldor Reliance 230/460 volt, 15 HP, 1765 RPM motor and uses 460-volt, 3-phase power and a variable speed control to maintain optimal flow of material from the hopper.\u00a0WeatherThe weather condition around the time of the accident was partly cloudy with a temperature of 79 degrees Fahrenheit and light winds. \u00a0Investigators did not consider weather to be a factor in the accident.Training and ExperienceDillon P. Chesney had 23 weeks of mining experience at this operation with no prior mining experience. \u00a0A representative from MSHA\u2019s Educational Field and Small Mine Services conducted an in-depth review of the mine operator\u2019s training records and Part 46 Training Plan.\u00a0 The victim did not receive task training for performing maintenance or repairs, and investigators found no documentation indicating he received training as a plant operator.\u00a0 The victim received only task training as a laborer and mobile equipment operator.\u00a0 The Part 46 Training Plan did not include procedures or training methods for performing maintenance and repairs and plant operation.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "Investigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified the following root causes:Root Cause:\u00a0 Management did not have a guard secured in place prior to operating the conveyor\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 Management revised the Training Plan and incorporated policies with respect to the use of guarding, and provided miners with appropriate training.\u00a0 Additional guarding was also installed.Root Cause:\u00a0 Management did not provide appropriate task training to the victim so he understood the hazards associated with the work being performed.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 Management provided miners with task training in proper workplace examinations, conveyor safety, conveyor guarding, plant operator guidelines, and locking and tagging out requirements and procedures.Root Cause:\u00a0 Management did not conduct adequate workplace examinations to identify hazards so appropriate corrective actions could be taken.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 Management introduced comprehensive workplace examination policies related to identifying hazardous conditions and provided training to the miners.", "CONCLUSION": "Dillon P. Chesney died after becoming entangled in the unguarded tail pulley of a belt conveyor.\u00a0 The accident occurred because the mine operator did not make sure that guarding was in place prior to placing the belt conveyor into operation; and did not have a competent person conduct adequate workplace examinations and correct hazards.", "ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS": "Issued to G S Materials Inc.Order

Mosley, District Manager", "OVERVIEW": "On Friday August 25, 2017, at approximately 12:08 p.m., Owen Jones, a 51-year-old mine examiner with over 27 years of mining experience fell onto a moving conveyor belt and received fatal injuries.\u00a0 Jones was attempting to cross the conveyor belt to complete his examination of the belt when he fell.The fatal accident occurred because the crossover provided by the operator was \u00a0not suitable for Jones and other miners to use as a means to cross over the belt when it was moving.\u00a0 In addition, the operator had not installed a guard to prevent Jones from crossing over the conveyor belt in an unsafe manner.\u00a0", "GENERAL INFORMATION": "\u00a0The Pleasant Hill Mine, an underground mine in the Sewell coal seam, is located near Mill Creek in Randolph County, West Virginia. \u00a0It is operated by the Carter Roag Coal Company.\u00a0 The mine employs 192 persons, 156 underground.\u00a0 The mine operates two production shifts and one maintenance shift five days a week.\u00a0 The mine produces 1,968 tons of raw coal daily from two continuous mining machine sections. \u00a0A conveyor system transports coal from the sections to the surface through one of the six drift openings. \u00a0An elevator is used to transport miners in and out of the mine.\u00a0 The mine is ventilated with a blowing fan. \u00a0The mine liberates over 1.2 million cubic feet of methane in a 24-hour period and is on a five day spot inspection schedule in accordance with Section 103(i) of the Mine Act.The principal officers at this mine at the time of this accident were:Chris Couch\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 Mine ManagerFred Watson\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u00a0 General Mine ForemanBrad Summerfield\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u00a0 Production SuperintendentCurtis Bailey\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u00a0 Production SuperintendentKelvin Napier\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u00a0 Safety ManagerAt the time of the accident, a regular (E01) safety and health inspection was in progress.\u00a0 The previous E01 inspection was completed on June 28, 2017.\u00a0 The non-fatal days lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for the Pleasant Hill Mine for 2016 was 3.36 compared to the national NFDL rate of 3.24 for mines of this type.\u00a0", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "\u00a0On Friday, August 25, 2017, Owen Jones started his shift at 6:30 a.m. \u00a0He traveled in a battery-powered mantrip to Zone 2, his usual work area, to clean, perform maintenance, and correct problems on the conveyor belts.\u00a0 Jones then traveled to Zone 1 to conduct examinations.\u00a0 Jones did not typically work in that area but was assigned to it that day by Mine Foreman Fred Watson because the regular Zone 1 examiner was absent.\u00a0Jones wrote the first date, time, and initials (DTI) on a date board at 11:30 a.m. at the No. 3 belt transfer.\u00a0 \u00a0He then proceeded to examine Zone 1, by driving the mantrip along the No. 2 conveyor belt.\u00a0 The belt is installed so\u00a0 the distance on one side to the coal rib is wider than the other side (wide side).\u00a0 Jones drove on the wide side and parked so he could examine the No. 2 transfer .\u00a0 He placed his DTI on the wide side date board at 11:58 a.m.\u00a0 A date board present on the other side (tight side) of the transfer did not have any DTI from him that day.There were no witnesses to the accident.\u00a0 However, the mine tracking system and other evidence gathered during the investigation indicate that Jones fell onto the moving conveyor belt as he attempted to cross the belt while it was moving.\u00a0 A wooden crossover structure was located 10 feet away. There was no \u00a0evidence to indicate that miners were using it.James Yoakum, Outside Yard Man, was checking the conveyor belt for spillage shortly after 2:00 p.m. when he discovered Jones on the ground under the canopy at the pit mouth (see Appendix A).\u00a0 Yoakum yelled for Jonathan Sexton and Matthew Ison, Contract Utility Miners working in the yard, to help. \u00a0Sexton traveled to Jones and was unable to detect a pulse.\u00a0 Yoakum went to the mine phone and called Thomas Lindsay, Dispatcher, to tell him he needed help because a man was down. \u00a0Lindsay called Roger Debar, Warehouse Manager, who called 911 at 2:12 p.m.\u00a0Several individuals, including emergency medical technicians (EMT), immediately responded to the accident. \u00a0The EMTs confirmed Jones had no pulse and determined no first aid would be performed due to the extent of his injuries.\u00a0 Couch and Bailey, who had also traveled to the scene, placed Jones on a back board.The Randolph County Emergency Squad arrived on the scene at 2:42 p.m.\u00a0 Dr. Hundley at the WVU Medical Command, pronounced Jones dead at 2:51 p.m\u00a0 after he consulted with the squad,. \u00a0The squad then transported Jones via ambulance to the Davis Medical Center in Elkins, West Virginia.\u00a0", "INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT": "\u00a0The Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center was notified of the accident on August 25, 2017, at 2:19 p.m.\u00a0 The DOL Contact Center notified Michael Stark, Staff Assistant in the Morgantown District Office who then notified the mine operator of its obligation to preserve the accident scene and that an investigator was traveling to the mine.\u00a0 Stark assigned Joedy Gutta, Coal Mine Safety & Health Specialist - Impoundments, and Tyler Peddicord, Coal Mine Safety & Health Specialist \u2013 Ventilation, to investigate the accident.\u00a0 Steven Stankus, Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, traveled to the site and verbally issued a 103(k) order upon arrival.The accident investigation was conducted in conjunction with the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST) and the Carter Roag Coal Company. \u00a0Before going underground, the team conducted preliminary interviews with persons having knowledge of the facts and circumstances concerning the accident.Investigators took photographs of the equipment and accident site (see Appendix B).\u00a0 A survey crew developed sketches of the pit mouth area where Jones was found and of the No. 2 belt transfer area (see Appendix C).MSHA and WVOMHST conducted formal interviews on August 29, 2017, at the MSHA District 3 Bridgeport Field Office.\u00a0 A list of persons interviewed and participating in the accident investigation is in appendix D.\u00a0", "DISCUSSION": "\u00a0Accident SiteThe accident site was identified by the parked mantrip Jones had been operating, the mine tracking system, and the physical evidence present at the No. 2 belt transfer point.WVOMHST conducted tests for stray electrical currents in the area.\u00a0 None were identified. \u00a0The conveyor belt start and stop switches provided at the No. 2 belt transfer were also tested and found to function properly.Mine Examination PracticesThe belt examiners utilize three-wheeled battery-operated mantrips to conduct the majority of the conveyor belt line examinations.\u00a0 They travel along the wide side of the conveyor belt.\u00a0 Crossovers are provided at locations where it is necessary to cross over the conveyor belt and examine the tight side of the belt.\u00a0 It is a mine practice for the examiners to examine both sides of the belt at transfer points and record their DTI at those locations.Mine Tracking SystemThe mine utilizes an MSHA approved tracking system manufactured by Matrix Design Group, LLC.\u00a0 The system utilizes transmitters called \u201ctags\u201d attached to miners\u2019 hard hats, and these \u201ctags\u201d transmit an electromagnetic signal approximately every two seconds.\u00a0 Antennae throughout the mine receive the signal and communicate the location of the tag (and the miner) to a system computer.\u00a0 The system makes a log of miners\u2019 locations.The tracking system log shows Jones was at No. 2 belt transfer point in Zone 1 at 11:54 a.m.\u00a0 At 11:57 a.m, he was located at No. 32 block on No. 1 conveyor belt, a distance of approximately 1,625 feet.\u00a0 At 11:59 a.m., he was located at No. 2 block. \u00a0This information is consistent with the speed of the conveyor belt and also indicates the accident occurred at the No. 2 transfer point.\u00a0 The system log shows that his tracker was outside the mine in the yard at 12:06 p.m.The investigation team examined the tracking system due to the time discrepancies on the date board and the times logged in the system for Jones\u2019 locations.\u00a0 The tracking system clock was found to be approximately 14 minutes behind eastern daylight time.No. 2 Belt TransferThe No. 2 belt transfer was constructed with flat steel covers over both sides of the conveyor belt (see photos in Appendix B). \u00a0The covers are approximately 32 inches above the mine floor. \u00a0The opening between the covers, where the conveyor belt is exposed, measures 29 inches. \u00a0Steel skirt boards extend vertically four and a half inches above both covers along the opening.\u00a0 The average clearance between the flat covers and the mine roof is 58 inches.\u00a0 Mined material leaves the No. 2 conveyor belt at a belt discharge roller located inside a steel chute with angled deflector walls.\u00a0 This steel chute, called a \u201crock box,\u201d funnels the material onto the No. 1 conveyor belt.Footprints were detected in the rock dust on the flat covers at the No. 2 transfer point.\u00a0 Handprints were found on the angled deflector on the tight side of the rock box. \u00a0Vertical streaking marks were in the dust on the inside and outside of this angled deflector measuring 25 inches in length. \u00a0The evidence indicates Jones was utilizing the outby side of the No. 2 transfer to cross over the moving No. 1 conveyor belt to travel to the tight side of the conveyor belt. \u00a0Investigators believe the streaking marks were made by Jones as he fell onto the conveyor belt.CrossoverThe crossover located 10 feet from where Jones fell onto the belt was constructed approximately 6 months before the fatal accident.\u00a0 The vertical support members were six inch by six inch timbers wedged to the mine roof.\u00a0 The floor and sides were one inch thick boards. \u00a0The crossover was 27 inches wide and 74 inches across the conveyor belt.\u00a0 The floor boards were an average of 46.5 inches above the mine floor, leaving only 34 inches to 37 inches of clearance to the mine roof.The dimensions of the crossover made it difficult to use. \u00a0A miner would not have enough width to turn on top of the crossover and climb down feet first. \u00a0Evidence gathered by investigators showed that it was not being used by miners, including mine examiners.\u00a0 Thick rock dust was evenly deposited and undisturbed on the crossover.\u00a0 If miners had used the crossover, the rock dust would have been disturbed.The distance from the coal on the conveyor belt to the bottom of the crossover was approximately six inches. \u00a0Investigators identified locations along the No. 1 conveyor belt where Jones contacted the crossover and mine roof while he was on the conveyor belt.\u00a0 Jones was found lying face down under the canopy at the pit mouth.\u00a0 A hold down roller installed near this location may have expelled Jones from the conveyor belt.Previous SafeguardOn May 25, 2010, an inspector attempted to use a crossover to cross the No. 1 belt while the belt was moving.\u00a0 A portion of the crossover broke and created an opening that a person could fall through.\u00a0 The inspector issued a notice to provide a safeguard requiring suitable crossing facilities in the mine where it is necessary for miners to cross moving conveyor belts.General Machine InformationThe conveyor belt involved in the accident is a Firewall II manufactured by Cobra America. \u00a0The No. 1 conveyor belt line is 60 blocks long. \u00a0It exits the mine from the number four pit mouth entry and dumps onto the outside stacker belt. \u00a0The conveyor belt is 48 inches wide.\u00a0 The No. 1 conveyor belt structure hangs from the mine roof with metal chains from the pit mouth to the 33 block. \u00a0The conveyor belt structure is on the mine floor from the 33 block to the 57 block. \u00a0Conveyor belt start and stop switches are located every 1,000 feet along the conveyor belts and at the No. 2 belt transfer.Training RecordsWilliam K. Roberts, MSHA Training Specialist, reviewed the training records.\u00a0 Jones had been employed at this mine since March 20, 2016. \u00a0He had 27 years of mining experience and his last annual refresher training was conducted on February 16, 2017. \u00a0He had also received task training on various tasks and the training was up to date.\u00a0 Five non-contributory training citations were issued for violations of 30 CFR 48.9 (a) because the training forms were not completed properly.\u00a0\u00a0", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "\u00a0MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 Root causes was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root causes identified during the investigation and the operator\u2019s implemented corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident.Root Cause: \u00a0The mine operator did not provide an adequate crossover outby the No. 2 belt drive for miners to safely cross the moving No. 1 conveyor belt.\nCorrective Action: The mine operator removed the crossover and constructed an adequate crossover for miners to use (see Appendix F).Root Cause: \u00a0The configuration of the drive on the outby side of the rock box was not constructed to prevent a miner from using it as means to cross the moving conveyor belt.\nCorrective Action: \u00a0The mine operator installed guards at certain belt transfer locations to prevent miners from using them as a means to cross a moving conveyor belt.\u00a0\u00a0", "CONCLUSION": "\u00a0On August 25, 2017, while conducting an examination of the No. 1 conveyor belt, the victim attempted to cross in an unsafe location, fell onto the moving belt and received fatal injuries as the belt transported him out of the mine.\u00a0The fatal accident occurred because the operator did not provide an adequate crossover for Jones and other miners to use as a means to cross over the belt.\u00a0 In addition, the operator had not installed a guard to prevent Jones from utilizing the transfer point as a means to cross the conveyor belt.\u00a0Signed

Four crew members saw Stevens at the filter location or spoke with him during their lunch break.\u00a0 Peterson was the last to see Stevens prior to the accident.\u00a0 He spoke to Stevens sometime between 9:30 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., while Stevens was going for a drink of water.At 1:20 a.m., August 3, 2017, Peterson traveled to where Stevens was working to tell him the shift had ended.\u00a0 Peterson discovered the water box attached to the filter had fallen on Stevens, pinning him underneath.\u00a0 Stevens did not respond when Peterson touched his legs. Peterson went to the 3rd floor and at 1:28 a.m. made an emergency radio call to Dennis Tripplet, AMS Operator and Security Guard, to inform him of the accident.\u00a0 Tripplet called 911 and notified the miners in the shower room to go help at the accident scene.\u00a0Peterson along with Richard Morgan, Prep Plant Operator and Emergency Medical Technician, and Brandon Chandler, Preparation Plant Operator, arrived and examined Stevens.\u00a0 Morgan did not detect a pulse and discovered that Stevens was cool to the touch.\u00a0 Peterson, Morgan, and Chandler used come-alongs and chains to lift the water box off of Stevens.\u00a0 Derick Atwood, Haul Truck Operator, and Chandler brought a stretcher and placed Stevens onto it. \u00a0They took Stevens to the first floor to wait for the ambulance.\u00a0 At 2:30 a.m., the Rangely District Hospital Ambulance arrived and examined Stevens.\u00a0 The ambulance crew contacted the county coroner.\u00a0 Roy Kinney, Rio Blanco County Coroner arrived and pronounced Stevens dead at 3:23 a.m. on August 3, 2017.", "INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT": "On August 3, 2017, at 1:38 a.m., Tripplet called the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center and reported a serious accident.\u00a0 The Contact Center notified Matthew Lemons, District 9 Coal Mine Safety and Health Roof Control Supervisor, of the accident at 1:53 a.m.\u00a0 Lemons notified Peter Saint, District 9 Coal Mine Safety and Health Electrical Supervisor.Saint verbally issued a 103(j) order to Tripplet at 4:20 a.m. \u00a0Tripplet notified Tony Gabossi, Shift Foreman, of the order and the accident scene was secured.Saint and Rufus Taylor, District 9 Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, arrived at the mine at 6:35 a.m.\u00a0 Upon arrival Taylor modified the 103(j) order to a 103(k) order to ensure the safety of all persons at the site, including those involved in the accident investigation.\u00a0 Saint and Taylor initiated the accident investigation by taking photographs and measurements of the scene and investigating the physical evidence of the accident.\u00a0 Deserado personnel who were present at the accident scene were interviewed.\u00a0Tain Curtis, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Roof Control Specialist/Accident Investigator, was notified of the accident on August 3, 2017 at 3:34 a.m.\u00a0 Curtis arrived at the mine at 8:30 a.m.\u00a0 James Preece, MSHA Assistant District Manager, was also notified of the accident and arrived at the mine at approximately 8:30 a.m.\u00a0 Curtis and Preece continued the investigation of the accident scene and took digital photographs, relevant measurements, and sketches of the scene.On August 3, 2017, Fred Sanchez, Supervisory Educational Field and Small Mine Services Training Specialist, traveled to the mine and conducted a thorough review of training and examination records.Investigators completed the investigation of the scene of the accident on August 3, 2017. \u00a0The investigation was conducted in conjunction with Deserado company representatives and United Mine Workers of America representatives.\u00a0 MSHA conducted formal interviews on August 7 and 14, 2017 at the mine. \u00a0The list of persons participating and those interviewed are listed in Appendix A.", "DISCUSSION": "\u00a0DismantlingThe Deserado Mine had begun a major overhaul of its preparation plant.\u00a0 Prior to the dismantling project, the water box, which is associated with the rotary filter system, supplied water and coal slurry to the coal filter.\u00a0 During this project, Stevens had been directed to dismantle the filter in the inactive section of the preparation plant.\u00a0 Because he was an experienced miner, mine management allowed Stevens to decide how he would dismantle the filter and structure, and he worked alone.On the day of the accident, Stevens was planning to continue dismantling the filter.\u00a0 He had previously removed the filter assembly but the water box still needed to be dismantled.\u00a0 He used a plasma cutter to cut the metal water box into smaller manageable pieces, and then lowered them from the 3rd floor to the 2nd floor. \u00a0Stevens had made cuts along the trough underneath the filter housing to allow the water box to separate.\u00a0 He left 1-inch wide strips of metal on both ends in an apparent attempt to hold the water box in place as it was being dismantled.\u00a0 The east end of the water box was attached to the filter tub. \u00a0Stevens had made a cut in this area to separate the water box from the filter tub.\u00a0 After the cuts were made, the box was only supported on the east end by a 1-inch wide strip of metal that tapered down to \u00be inches wide. \u00a0\u00a0The accident occurred when the water box shifted and fell on top of Stevens (see Appendix B).\u00a0 Adequate blocking material had not been installed to support the water box.Investigators determined from the location of Stevens\u2019 body that he had positioned himself under the water box.\u00a0 The east end of the water box fell approximately 29 inches, pinning Stevens\u2019 upper body to the floor.\u00a0 The mine\u2019s engineering department estimated that the water box weighed about 1,400 pounds.Securely Blocking Against MotionWhen performing work under machinery or equipment that has been raised, the machinery or equipment is required to be securely blocked against motion.\u00a0 Instead of properly blocking the water box against motion prior to beginning to take it apart, Stevens depended on the 1-inch wide strip of metal he cut on the east end and the 3-inch wide strip on the west end to support the water box.ExaminationsBecause the work area where the accident occurred is located in the surface area of an underground mine, on-shift examinations were not required and were not conducted.Training and ExperienceStevens started his employment at the Deserado mining operation on February 28, 2011.\u00a0 He had six years and 20 weeks experience at the mine and had been in his current position as a surface mechanic for two years and 23 weeks.\u00a0 Stevens had 12 years 40 weeks of total mining experience.Training records reviewed indicated that Stevens\u2019 training was up-to-date, and in accordance with 30 CFR \u00a7 Part 48. \u00a0He was task trained for blocking against motion on May 5, 2017.\u00a0 He was also task trained on cutting and welding on April 14, 2012, and had site-specific training on the mine operators\u2019 Safe Operating Guidelines on May 24, 2017, which also addressed blocking against motion.\u00a0 He received annual refresher training on March 20, 2017.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 A root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the investigation and the operator\u2019s implemented corrective actions to prevent a reoccurrence of this type of accident.\u00a0Root Cause:\u00a0 Mine management did not ensure that machinery or materials being worked on were securely blocked against motion prior to work being performed.\u00a0 The water box was cut loose from the trough and was not secured against motion.\u00a0 The metal strip that was left to hold the water box in place on the east end was not sufficient.\u00a0 This support allowed the water box to shift and fall on the victim\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 Mine management developed a plan for the remaining dismantling of the preparation plant trough and trained all employees to ensure safe completion of the project.\u00a0 Management will continue to review plans with miners to ensure blocking against motion of all material and equipment in future projects.", "CONCLUSION": "\u00a0On Thursday, August 3, 2017, at approximately 1:30 a.m., Jason Stevens, a 32-year-old surface mechanic with 12 years of mining experience, received fatal injuries while he was dismantling a water box.\u00a0 The water box fell and struck Stevens and pinned him to the floor of the preparation plant.The accident occurred because the mine operator did not ensure that the water box being dismantled was securely blocked against motion during the dismantling process. \u00a0\u00a0Signed By:______________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0

The principal operating official is Tom Phillips, General Manager. The mine operates multiple shifts, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Total employment is 662 persons.\nCopper ore is drilled and blasted in the open pit and transported by haul truck to a primary crusher. Crushed ore is transported to the mill by belt conveyor. The ore is then milled, concentrated, and smelted into copper plates. The finished product is sold to commercial industries.\nThe Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection of this operation on May 18, 2017.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On July 27, 2017, Gabriel Benitez (victim) began work at 7:00 p.m. Brian\nSamuelson, Shifter, assigned Benitez cable handler duties for this shift. After conducting a pre-operational inspection of the F-550 cable handler (pickup) truck, Benitez went to work.At 8:20 p.m., Benitez drove the F-550 cable handler truck to the 3450 dump site, passing Erik Lopez, Equipment Operator, who was operating a rubber-tired dozer. Benitez parked his truck at the north end of the dump site, next to a wind row of material used to delineate the western boundary of the dump site. The cab of Benitez\u2019s truck was facing south and the truck\u2019s operating lights and strobe light had been turned off. Personal cell phone records indicate that Benitez had been using his cellphone while he was at the dump site.At 8:33 p.m., Johnny Tynes, Heavy Truck Operator, entered the 3450 dump site in a Komatsu 930E-4, 320-ton haul truck, company number 316. Lopez directed Tynes to begin dumping further north (Figure 1). After dumping his load, Tynes began leaving the dump site. Nick Gomez, Heavy Truck Operator, entered the3450 dump site in a Komatsu 930E-1, 320-ton haul truck, company number 390.Tynes made a large arcing turn in leaving the dump site to allow more room for Gomez\u2019s haul truck.Prior to Haul Truck 390 entering the dump, Justin Benefield, Heavy Truck Operator, entered the dump site in a Komatsu 930E-4, 320-ton haul truck, company number 321. Benefield was not involved in the accident and did not witness the accident.As the two haul trucks approached each other, Tynes felt the haul truck rock back and forth as though it had hit something. After the two haul trucks passed each other, Tynes made a U-turn to see what he had contacted to determine if\nLopez would need to clean the area with the rubber-tired dozer (Figure 2).\u00a0 Tynes saw he had contacted the victim\u2019s truck and called a mayday over the two-way radio.\u00a0 Lopez and Gomez proceeded to the scene.\u00a0 Mine officials immediately called emergency medical services. \u00a0At 8:57 pm, Metro Fire and Rescue arrived, followed shortly by Metro EMS to begin extrication.\u00a0 The Pima County Sheriff pronounced Benitez dead at the scene at 10:34 pm. \u00a0The cause of death was blunt force trauma.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "Bjorn Meyer, Mine Manager, called the Department of Labor\u2019s National Contact Center (DOLNCC) at 9:28 p.m. MST on July 27, 2017, to notify MSHA of the accident. \u00a0The DOLNCC notified Pete Del Duca, Staff Assistant for MSHA\u2019s Rocky Mountain District Office, and MSHA started an investigation the same night.\u00a0 MSHA issued an order under the provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act to ensure the safety of the miners.MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team traveled to the mine site, made a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed miners and reviewed conditions and work procedures relevant to the accident.\u00a0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, the State of Arizona Mine Inspector\u2019s Office, miners and their representatives.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred on the 3450 dump site.\u00a0 The trucks were on the west side of the dump, progressively dumping from the north end to the south end.\u00a0 Immediately prior to the accident, the dumping location had been repositioned to the north end of the dump to restart the dumping cycle.\u00a0Pickup TruckThe investigation showed the pickup truck involved in the accident was a 2012, Ford F-550 4X2 standard cab truck.\u00a0 The truck was completely destroyed in the accident.\u00a0 An information download of the truck\u2019s black box revealed no useful information.\u00a0 Investigators determined the truck was equipped with a flashing beacon light and reflective flag attached to an antenna that was approximately twelve feet above the ground.Investigators found the vehicle light switch in the off position.\u00a0 Witness statements indicated the beacon strobe light and the vehicle lights were not on at the time of the accident.\u00a0Haul TruckThe investigation revealed the haul truck involved in the accident was a 2012, Komatsu 930E-4E rigid frame rear dump truck with an alternating current electric-drive system. \u00a0Investigators noted the truck was equipped with a Komatsu, SSDA16V160, diesel engine, and all lights and other safety equipment were functional.Dumpsite IlluminationInvestigators found one light plant at the 3450 dump site, but it was positioned facing the previous dump location.\u00a0 The operator did not reposition the light when the dump site moved to the north, and the victim\u2019s location at the 3450 dump site was not illuminated at the time of the accident.\u00a0 Additionally, investigators observed only three of the four lights of the light plant were operational.Haul Truck Operator View TestsInvestigators conducted a re-creation of the accident with haul trucks 316 and 390 at approximately the same time of day the accident occurred. \u00a0Shifter Brian Samuelson placed the dump site light plant mast in its original position (the light had been repositioned during recovery operations), and observers noted truck 316 had a blind spot of approximately 30 feet directly in front of it.\u00a0 The re-creation provided evidence that the victim\u2019s truck was not easily visible while exiting the dump.Weather\nInvestigators noted the weather at the time of the accident was cloudy with light rain and a temperature of approximately 79\u00ba F.\u00a0 Visibility played a role in the accident.Traffic ControlInvestigators reviewed the operator\u2019s procedures for traffic control, right-of-way, and direction of movement.\u00a0 The operator had no procedures to address light duty trucks on dump sites.\u00a0 According to interviews and on-site observations, the dump site is one of the few areas of the mine where cell phone coverage is available.\u00a0 Cell phone records indicate that Benitez had been using his cell phone while he was at the dump site.\u00a0 In addition, interviews indicated that persons regularly used the dump site during the night shift for various unknown reasons that were not work-related.", "TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE": "Gabriel Benitez, victim, had five years and fifteen weeks of mining experience all at this mine. \u00a0He received training in accordance with 30 CFR Part 48.\nJohnny Tynes, Heavy Truck Driver, had two months, two weeks and four days of mining experience all at this mine as a heavy truck operator. \u00a0He

"ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "Investigators performed a root cause analysis and identified the following root causes:Root Cause: Management had not established traffic control policies and procedures to control the movement of light duty vehicles in the dump areas.\u00a0 Management failed to ensure that light duty vehicles were only in the area to conduct work related activities.Corrective Action: Management established new procedures in the mine's \u201cPit Driving Training\u201d policy titled \u201cApproaching and Leaving an Active Dump\u201d.\u00a0 The new policy designates how light duty vehicles, service trucks and support utility trucks will interact with active dump areas.\u00a0 Management trained all miners regarding these new policies and procedures.Root Cause: Management had not established a procedure to ensure dump sites are properly illuminated to safely light the active dumping areas.Corrective Action: Management established a \u201cMine Supervisor Developmental Training Plan\u201d, which addresses lighting and dump areas.\u00a0 Supervisors will visit dump sites to determine if the illumination is adequate and to ensure changes are made in lighting, if necessary, as the dump area changes during the shift.", "CONCLUSION": "Gabriel Antonio Benitez was fatally injured when a Komatsu 930E-4 haul truck ran over his parked, F-550 pickup truck. \u00a0The victim was parked within the designated traffic pattern for the haul trucks, outside of the illumination of the singular light plant.\u00a0 The accident occurred because the operator did not have policies, procedures, and controls to ensure the adequate illumination of dump site areas and did not manage light duty vehicle traffic in active dump areas. \u00a0"}},

47 refuse bank area of the mine.\u00a0 He worked alone, operating a CAT D9L bulldozer to push material down the bank to a screening area pad where an excavator could load it into a screen at a later date.\u00a0 Seth Huey, Foreman, also started his shift at 6:00 a.m., by conducting his job site examination. \u00a0Huey drove through the bottom of the Oak Hill P \u2013 47 operation to the screening area pad, observed no hazards, and drove away from the area.\u00a0 At approximately 9:30 a.m., Huey drove to the Oak Hill P \u2013 47 to meet Oxenrider on the road at the top of the refuse bank to give him further instructions. \u00a0Huey sent Oxenrider a text message while he was on his way, but did not get a reply. \u00a0Huey arrived at the top of the refuse bank, got out of his truck and stood on a berm, but he did not see Oxenrider\u2019s bulldozer. \u00a0Huey also called Oxenrider on his cellular telephone and did not get an answer. \u00a0Huey drove back down to the screening area pad, assuming that Oxenrider was on the pad getting fuel.Huey arrived at the screening area pad and found the bulldozer, which was positioned blade first into the ground, at the bottom of the refuse bank. \u00a0He ran toward the bulldozer and noticed that the engine was running at low idle and the door was open. \u00a0Oxenrider was not in the bulldozer cab, and Huey saw him lying on the ground near the edge of the bank. \u00a0Huey approached Oxenrider and observed that he had received fatal injuries.Huey immediately called Frank Derrick, General Manager, and told him to come right away because the bulldozer was over the bank and Oxenrider was lying on the ground.\u00a0 Huey then called Riccardo Muntone, Vice President of Safety and Compliance. \u00a0Derrick arrived at the bottom of the refuse bank. \u00a0He called 911 at 9:42 a.m. and then traveled to the entrance gate and waited for emergency assistance to arrive.\u00a0Schuylkill Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at the accident scene at 10:09 a.m. \u00a0A front end loader was used to open a road for the EMS to travel to the scene in an all-terrain vehicle (ATV). \u00a0After EMS evaluated Oxenrider, Andrew Szczyglak, Schuylkill County Deputy Coroner, arrived and pronounced Oxenrider dead at the scene at 11:05 a.m.\u00a0", "\u00a0": "", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "\u00a0Muntone called the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center at 10:03 a.m. A noncontributory citation was issued to the mine operator for a violation of 30 CFR \u00a7 50.10 because the mine operator did not contact MSHA immediately, at once, without delay, and within 15 minutes.On July 25, 2017, at 10:15 a.m., Randall Caramellino, MSHA District 2 Staff Assistant, was notified of the fatal accident by the DOL Contact Center.\u00a0 Caramellino informed Patrick Boylan, Frackville Field Office Supervisor.\u00a0 Boylan dispatched Stephen Kowalick, Coal Mine Inspector (CMI) and Joseph Draugelis, CMI and Accident Investigator, to the mine.\u00a0 Upon his arrival at 10:35 a.m., Draugelis issued a 103(k) order to ensure the safety of all persons on site and to prevent the destruction of evidence that would aid in investigating the cause or causes of the accident.\u00a0 Kowalick arrived at the same time as Draugelis, and Boylan arrived shortly after.Kowalick, Draugelis, and Boylan took photographs and gathered preliminary information. \u00a0They also conducted initial interviews with the Reading Anthracite company management personnel who were present at the accident scene (see Appendix A).The accident investigation was conducted jointly with the Anthracite and Industrial Minerals Mine Safety Division of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).\u00a0 United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) representatives and Reading Anthracite company management participated in the investigation.\u00a0 A list of the persons who participated in the investigation is in Appendix A.\u00a0Formal interviews were conducted by MSHA and DEP on July 26 and 31 and August 2, 10, and 16, 2017 at the Frackville Field Office.\u00a0 All persons interviewed were involved in mining activity at the Oak Hill P \u2013 47 Operation or had operated or maintained the bulldozer involved in the accident.The investigators obtained the service history of the bulldozer from the time it was rebuilt in 2004 by Fabco Equipment Inc., until the air conditioner was serviced by a company mechanic on July 20, 2017.Onsite testing and evaluation of the bulldozer was conducted by MSHA Technical Support on July 28 and 29, and on August 3 and 4, 2017.\u00a0 Technical representatives and a mechanic from Cleveland Brothers Equipment Co. Inc. were present during the testing.\u00a0 Evidence obtained from the bulldozer was removed and itemized through the MSHA chain of custody forms.\u00a0", "DISCUSSION": "\u00a0", "Accident Location": "The accident occurred on the refuse bank approximately 400 yards from the mine entrance gate.\u00a0 The bulldozer was used to push material along a path that was sloped to various degrees ranging from 17 to 20 degrees.\u00a0 As the bulldozer pushed the refuse material, berms of material were created on both sides of the machine to various heights.\u00a0 The berms ranged in height from 18 to 31 inches on one side of the bulldozer, and 36 to 60 inches on the other side.Because the manufacturer\u2019s parking procedure was not followed, the bulldozer moved downhill after the victim exited the bulldozer.\u00a0 After the bulldozer hit the victim, it travelled over the edge of the refuse pile and went down a 44 degree slope.\u00a0 It traveled to the toe of the slope, and was found in the \u201claid\u201d position (see Appendix C).\u00a0 Because the blade dug in deeper than the 44 degree slope, the machine was actually at a 55 degree slope when it was found by investigators.", "General Machine Information": "The bulldozer involved in the fatal accident is a 1984 Caterpillar D9L track type tractor, serial number 14Y02387. \u00a0It is equipped with a 9S bulldozer blade, a Caterpillar 3412 diesel engine with a power rating of 460 horsepower, and a power shift transmission with three speeds in both forward and reverse direction. \u00a0The bulldozer uses an elevated type drive sprocket arrangement and weighs approximately 115,000 pounds, which includes the blade. \u00a0The engine hour meter showed 26,281.1 hours of use.", "Maintenance and Service Records": "According to maintenance and service history records, the bulldozer was rebuilt by Fabco Equipment Inc., a Caterpillar dealer for the State of Wisconsin. \u00a0The bulldozer\u00a0was purchased by Reading Anthracite in December 2016. \u00a0Investigators reviewed service, maintenance, and pre-operational check records provided by the mine operator, and they did not indicate any problems with the parking or service brake systems.", "Testing and Evaluation": "Investigators determined that the only damage the bulldozer sustained during the accident was to the right side of the windshield. The transmission was in the neutral position and the parking brake lever was in the released position. \u00a0The bulldozer was able to start and operate without any repairs for the purpose of testing.", "Function Test": "Function testing revealed the following:The governor control lever and the decelerator foot pedal linkages were intact and moved throughout their range without binding or sticking.\nFrom powershift transmission testing, the transmission selector lever and hydraulic control valve moved throughout first and second gear positions without sticking or binding. \u00a0A metal plate installed across the opening of the shifting guide for the transmission selector lever prevented 3rd gear from being selected in forward or reverse.\nThe blade control has four positions: \u00a0float, lower, hold, and raise. \u00a0The blade control was found in the float detent position. \u00a0Since, distinct hand effort is required to push the control lever from hold to the detent float position; investigators determined the victim must have put the blade control in the float position before he exited the bulldozer.\n", "Braking System Design": "The service and parking brake systems consist of spring-applied, hydraulically- released, enclosed wet disc brakes in both track drives.\u00a0 The service brake is activated by a foot pedal which varies the brake pressure to the wet disc brakes. \u00a0The parking brake is activated by a hand control lever. \u00a0The parking brake lever linkage has an overcenter spring.\u00a0 This spring pulls the lever to apply or release the parking brake.\u00a0 If the operator wants to fully apply the parking brake, he will move the lever down.\u00a0 When the lever moves past the overcenter position, the overcenter spring will pull the lever the remaining distance to fully apply the parking brake.Conversely, if the operator wants to fully release the parking brake, he will move the lever up.\u00a0 When the lever moves past the overcenter position, the overcenter spring will pull the lever the remaining distance to fully release the parking brake.The parking brake control lever is designed so that it partially obstructs the exit door of the bulldozer when the parking brake is in the released position. \u00a0This serves as a visual reminder to the operator to remain in the cab of the bulldozer until the parking brake is fully engaged.\u00a0 In the released position, the parking brake lever is parallel with the cab floor and approximately 15 \u00be inches above the cab floor and approximately 5 \u00be inches from the dash panel (see Appendix B, Picture 1).The foot pedal service brake and parking brake lever controls activate a common single linkage on the steering and brake valve. \u00a0The same brakes are applied within the track drives regardless of which controls are used. \u00a0They are automatically applied when the engine is shut down due to hydraulic release pressure to the brakes.", "Service and Parking Brake Controls, and Performance Test": "When the service brake foot pedal was tested, it functioned and moved throughout its range without sticking or binding.\u00a0 Investigators determined, however, that the pedal linkage was out of adjustment based on the specifications of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).The parking brake lever was found in the released position after the accident. \u00a0The parking brake lever and linkage were still functional but testing revealed problems with the operation of the lever:The parking brake had a \u201cstay point\u201d range where the lever was on the applied side of the parking brake linkage overcenter spring, but was not being pulled into the fully applied position by the overcenter spring.\u00a0 The parking brake would be applied, but the lever would not be snapped completely into position.\nLow hand force was all that was needed to pull the parking brake lever through the \u201cstay point\u201d toward the released position.\u00a0\nThe parking brake control lever would move towards the released position if the following sequence occurred:\u00a0 The foot pedal was fully applied.\u00a0 Next, the parking brake was applied.\u00a0 Lastly, the foot brake was released. \u00a0This movement was able to move the parking brake lever to the released position if the lever was not set past the \u201cstay point\u201d when applied. \u00a0This sequence could be expected when the bulldozer is stopped by an operator on a steep grade (see Appendix B, Picture 2).\u00a0 If an operator stops on a grade by pushing the foot pedal and then engages the parking brake lever to the \u201cstay point,\u201d the parking brake lever could release when he takes his foot off the foot pedal.\n", "Manufacturer\u2019s Parking Procedure": "The victim was not trained on the manufacturer\u2019s parking procedure in the operator\u2019s manual.\u00a0 The general parking procedure outlined in the operation and maintenance manual is as follows:Park on a level surface. \u00a0If necessary to park on a grade, block the machine.\nApply the service brake to stop the machine.\nShift the transmission control to neutral.\nEngage the parking brake.\nLower all implements to the ground and apply slight down pressure.\nStop the engine.\nTurn the start switch to the OFF position.\nTurn the disconnect switch key to the OFF position and remove the key.\nIn this instance, the victim had not parked the bulldozer on a level surface.\u00a0 He applied the service brake to stop the machine and he shifted into neutral.\u00a0 He may or may not have engaged, or partially engaged the parking brake. \u00a0The victim put the bulldozer blade in the float position but did not apply slight down pressure.\u00a0 There were no rippers (long claw-like device on the back of the bulldozer) on the bulldozer.\u00a0 The victim also did not stop the engine, turn the start switch to the OFF position, or turn the disconnect switch key to the OFF position.", "Technical Support Findings": "MSHA Technical Support determined that the problems with the operation of the parking brake assembly were due to an incorrect overcenter spring installed in the assembly.\u00a0 This spring provided considerably less spring force than the OEM overcenter spring and made it easier for the parking brake lever to move to the released position. \u00a0The lever force test demonstrated that replacing the incorrect overcenter spring raised the hand force requirements from approximately 1 pound of force to approximately 6 pounds of force. \u00a0Photographs taken of the bulldozer, before it was purchased, and when it was transferred to the equipment dealer, indicate that the general condition of the parking brake lever linkage existed prior to the mine operator purchasing the bulldozer. \u00a0The lack of a positive spring and linkage action to firmly hold the parking brake control lever in the applied position could have contributed to the accident had the victim engaged or attempted to engage the parking brake and it did not hold (see Appendix B, Pictures 3 and 4).", "Ground Control Plan": "The mine operator\u2019s ground control plan was established by the mine operator and filed with MSHA on April 13, 2016, over a year before the Oak Hill P-47 operation became active and producing.\u00a0 The Oak Hill P \u2013 47 refuse bank area began operation on July 13, 2017, 12 days before the accident.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, the mine operator had not developed another ground control plan which included provisions to address the hazards associated with mining on a refuse bank.The plan should have included the following provisions to insure safe mining conditions:Maintaining a substantial pile of refuse material at the end of a bulldozer push path to prevent the bulldozer from pushing over the edge of the push path. \u00a0This pile of refuse material is created when the bulldozer pushing the material leaves one to two bulldozer blades of material at the end of the push.\nMaintaining the edge of the bulldozer push path at a reduced grade to prevent a condition where a bulldozer could travel over the edge of a push path.\n", "Training and Experience": "MSHA conducted a thorough review of Reading Anthracite Company\u2019s training records.\u00a0 The victim had seven years and nine months of total mining experience as an equipment operator.\u00a0 He received his first eight hours of new miner training on November 9, 2015, and completed the required twenty four hours of training on November 12, 2015, at West Spring Energy LLC. \u00a0Task training records verify that he received training on D10, D9R, and D9T bulldozers, 16G grader, 375 excavator, HM400 articulated truck, and various haul trucks. \u00a0The last record of annual refresher training he received was at West Spring Energy LLC on February 2, 2017.On July 13, 2017, the victim started at Reading Anthracite Company\u2019s New St. Nicholas Breaker (Oak Hill P - 47 Operation).\u00a0 He received hazard training specific to the mine site and task training on the bulldozer on the same day he started working alone on the refuse bank clearing trees.Since the victim was a new employee but an experienced miner, the operator was required to give him experienced miner training.\u00a0 While he received experienced miner training, it was inadequate.\u00a0 The victim was not trained on the specific mining conditions or on the mine\u2019s ground control plan, as specifically outlined in the operator\u2019s training plan approved by MSHA on November 13, 2013.While the victim did receive task training on the bulldozer, the training was not conducted according to the operator\u2019s approved training plan, which required using the bulldozer\u2019s operator\u2019s manual issued by the manufacturer.\u00a0 This manual was not used when the victim was task trained because the mine operator did not have a copy. \u00a0In addition, investigators learned that the parking procedures for parking on a grade were not discussed or performed during task training. \u00a0Greg Sterling, Maintenance Superintendent, provided the victim with the task training on the bulldozer.\u00a0 However, he did not review the CAT D9L operator\u2019s manual with the victim and had never operated the machine.Non-contributory citations were issued for violations of 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 48.27(a)(1), 30 C.F.R. \u00a7 48.29(a), and 30 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a048.27(d) due to training deficiencies.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are root causes identified during the investigation and the operator\u2019s implemented corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident:Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not provide adequate task training to the victim.\u00a0 The operator\u2019s approved training plan required training on the provisions in the bulldozer\u2019s operating manual but the operator did not have a copy of the manual.\u00a0 In addition, investigators learned that the parking procedures for parking on a grade were not discussed and performed during task training.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator adequately trained equipment operators on the safety aspects and safe operating procedures of their machines, according to the operating manuals and approved training plan.\u00a0 The task training included supervised practice during nonproduction or supervised operation during production.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not develop a suitable ground control plan.\u00a0 The ground control plan did not address the hazards associated with mining a refuse bank.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator has developed a ground control plan to address the hazards associated with mining on a refuse bank.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not provide adequate experienced miner training, as outlined in its approved training plan.\u00a0 The training plan requires training on the ground control plan, which was inadequate at the time of the accident\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator trained all equipment operators on the provisions of the ground control plan that were added after the fatal accident.\u00a0", "CONCLUSION": "\u00a0On Tuesday, July 25, 2017, a 28-year-old equipment operator with seven years and nine months of total mining experience was fatally injured while operating a Caterpillar D9L bulldozer on a refuse bank.\u00a0 The accident occurred when the victim, who was working alone, was run over by the bulldozer.\u00a0 Investigators believe that shortly before the accident he exited the bulldozer onto the slope of the refuse bank and into the bulldozer\u2019s push path near the edge of the refuse bank.Because the manufacturer\u2019s parking procedure was not followed, the bulldozer moved downhill after the victim exited the bulldozer.\u00a0 When the bulldozer hit him, he was positioned between the track and blade.\u00a0 The bulldozer did not stop, but traveled over the edge of the refuse pile and came to rest at the bottom of the embankment. \u00a0There were no witnesses to the accident.The fatal accident occurred because the manufacturer\u2019s braking procedure was not followed.\u00a0 Also, the mine operator did not adequately task train the victim in accordance with the approved training plan, which included training on the safe operating procedures outlined in the bulldozer\u2019s operators manual for parking the bulldozer on a grade.\u00a0 In addition, the mine operator did not maintain the bulldozer in a safe operating condition with regard to the braking system.\u00a0Approved By:_________________________\u00a0

Kantala IV, ledge man, age 36, was fatally injured on July 20, 2017, while performing secondary breakage operations on a block of granite.\u00a0 A large piece of granite broke loose and knocked Kantala off a ledge to the mine floor approximately 10 feet below. The large piece of granite hit the ledge and broke into three pieces. One of the pieces, weighing an estimated six tons, fell on Kantala.The accident occurred because the mine operator: (1) did not block material during secondary breakage operations to prevent movement; (2) did not make sure miners were using fall protection; and (3) did not conduct an adequate workplace examination \u2013by not identifying a prominent geological anomaly in the granite and not promptly initiating appropriate action to correct such condition.", "GENERAL INFORMATION": "The Blue Sky Quarry #2 is a surface granite mining operation located in Carlton, Oglethorpe County, Georgia.\u00a0 The mine operation\u2019s manager is Randy Rice.\u00a0 The mine operates five days per week with one eight-hour shift per day, and employs nine people.The granite is drilled and diamond sawed into large blocks and then sized using a drill/wedge procedure.\u00a0 This procedure consists of drilling 3/4-inch holes approximately 12-16 inches apart in the rock face with a small jackhammer drill (plug drill), then driving 3/4-inch wedges that are 5 inches long into the holes.\u00a0 A hammer is used to drive the wedges in until the rock fractures.\u00a0 This creates a block about 5 feet tall by 5 feet deep and approximately 5-8 feet long.\u00a0 The block of rock is then transported to an on-site saw shop and further sized for shipping, primarily to the northeastern part of the United States, for use as curbing material.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on May 2, 2017.", "DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT": "Matthew W. Kantala IV, a ledge man at Blue Sky Quarry #2, reported to work on July 20, 2017, at his normal starting time of 6:00 a.m.\u00a0 At approximately 6:15 a.m., Arturo Metorio, operator/foreman, instructed Kantala on which ledge to work. \u00a0Metorio proceeded with operating a front-end loader in another area of the mine while Kantala proceeded to the working area where the accident occurred.Approximately 20 minutes later, Metorio saw Kantala going to the office area.\u00a0 Kantala told Metorio he was going to retrieve the small plug drill.\u00a0 Approximately 20 minutes after speaking with the victim, Metorio observed Kantala walking to another area of the mine and returning with a larger jackhammer. Metorio did not speak with Kantala at that point.\u00a0 The larger jackhammer is primarily used to break the shale cap rock overlying the granite and is not typically used in the secondary breakage process.\u00a0Approximately 20 minutes later, Metorio observed another miner, Gumercindo Hernandez, running toward him.\u00a0 Hernandez told Metorio he heard a loud crack and a slide in the area Kantala was working and went to see what had happened.\u00a0 Hernandez told Metorio that he saw Kantala lying on the mine floor with a large rock on top of him.Metorio went to the area at the northeast corner of the pit and saw Kantala lying on the mine floor under a large granite rock.\u00a0 Metorio got the attention of Tracy Harris, drill operator, who is trained in first-aid, to come to the site.\u00a0 Harris checked for a pulse and did not find one.\u00a0 Harris stayed with Kantala until emergency medical services (EMS) arrived.\u00a0 An employee called EMS at approximately 10:15 a.m., and emergency services arrived on site at approximately 10:28 a.m.\u00a0 Workers recovered the victim\u2019s body at approximately 1:35 p.m.\u00a0 The cause of death was attributed to crushing injuries.\u00a0", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "Randy Rice, Manager, called the Department of Labor\u2019s National Contact Center (DOLNCC) at 10:53 a.m. on July 20, 2017.\u00a0 The DOLNCC contacted Mike Evans, Safety Specialist, Southeastern District.\u00a0 Upon arrival at the mine site, an investigator issued an order pursuant to Section 103(k) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977, as amended.MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, reviewed training documentation, and examined work procedures relevant to the accident.\u00a0 Mine management assisted in the investigation.", "DISCUSSION": "WeatherWeather was not a factor.\u00a0 The skies were clear with no rain, and there was a high temperature of approximately 95 degrees Fahrenheit on the day of the accident.\u00a0Training and Work ExperienceThe victim was an experienced miner (ledge man) who performed this work at this mine for 1 year, 35 weeks.\u00a0 He previously worked at other mining operations performing similar duties.\u00a0 A representative of MSHA\u2019s Educational Field and Small Mine Services conducted an in-depth review of the victim\u2019s training records.\u00a0 MSHA determined that training records were in compliance with training requirements.Elberton GraniteThis intrusion of granite is referred to as Elberton Granite in this geographical area. The Elberton Granite has an approximate size of 35 miles long and 6 miles wide.\u00a0 The entire area is not solid granite, but there are individual deposits, or \u201cbodies\u201d of granite, within the area.\u00a0 Granite is plentiful on the surface in the area around Blue Sky Quarry #2.Work Procedures\u00a0Investigators determined that Kantala was on a ledge in front of the large piece of granite breaking it into smaller blocks.\u00a0 He drilled a 1-1/4-inch diameter hole and used an 8-inch wedge to perform the secondary breakage instead of using the normal method for secondary breakage described above.AnomalyA prominent anomaly is present in the rock formation.\u00a0 This anomaly is an interface between two bands of granite that likely formed at different times and/or cooled at different rates, and creates a plane of weakness within the granite.\u00a0 The anomaly typically allows for breakage in the horizontal plane.\u00a0 Mine management was aware of this anomaly, but did not identify it during workplace examinations so that corrective actions could be taken.A large section of granite sloughed off at the anomaly because it was not blocked to prevent movement which would endanger persons in the work area.\u00a0 This section of granite was approximately 18-20 feet long and 5 feet thick. While standing on some stacked rock that had been placed on the work bench, the victim was driving wedges into a block of granite in an attempt to break it loose. A piece of granite weighing six tons fell and pushed the victim from the work bench onto the mine floor, approximately 10 feet below. \u00a0The victim was wearing a fall protection harness, but it was not secured to an anchor and therefore was not protective.\u00a0", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "Investigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified the following root causes:Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not block material to prevent movement during secondary breakage operations.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator purchased new equipment and trained miners in a newly developed plan with procedures for different methods of secondary breakage.\u00a0 This plan addresses and requires the prevention of movement of material.\u00a0Root Cause: The mine operator did not assure that miners used fall protection where there was a danger of falling.\nCorrective Action: The mine operator purchased new equipment and trained miners in a newly developed plan with procedures for different methods of secondary breakage.\u00a0 This plan addresses and requires the use of fall protection.\u00a0Root Cause: The mine operator did not conduct adequate workplace examinations.\nCorrective Action: The mine operator trained miners in a newly developed plan with procedures for different methods of secondary breakage.\u00a0 This plan addresses workplace examinations and actions to be taken to address any hazardous conditions found.", "CONCLUSION": "Matthew W. Kantala IV was fatally injured while performing secondary breakage operations when a large section of granite rock fell, knocked him to the mine floor, and a portion of the granite fell on top of him.\u00a0 The accident occurred because the mine operator did not: (1) block material during secondary breakage operations to prevent movement; (2) make sure miners were using fall protection; and (3) conduct adequate workplace examinations \u2013the operator failed to identify a prominent geological anomaly in the granite and failed to take prompt, appropriate action to correct such condition.", "ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS": "Issued to Blue Sky Quarries Inc. (Mine Operator) Order No. 8905136 -- issued July 20, 2017, pursuant to Section 103(k) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977:A fatal accident occurred at this mining operation on July 20, 2017, when a miner was working on the SE corner of the East Quarry. A large block of dimensional stone [granite] came loose, slid toward the miner, forcing him off the ledge and fell on top of the miner at the bottom of the quarry. This order is issued to assure the safety of all persons at this operation. It prohibits all activity at the SE corner of the East Pit area until MSHA has determined that it is safe to resume normal operations in the area.

Monday, June 19, 2017, Shepherd started his shift at 3:00 p.m. as part of the evening crew.\u00a0 After a safety meeting, Willie Edwards, Evening Shift Foreman, gave out work assignments. \u00a0At about 3:08 p.m., Locomotive Operators Darrell Silas and Derrick Allen entered the mine and traveled to the No. 6 locomotive and the No. 12 locomotive. \u00a0After they conducted a pre-operational check, Silas and Allen drove the locomotives to the bottom of the service shaft and coupled four rail cars already loaded with supplies.\u00a0The No. 6 locomotive, operated by Allen, was in the lead, followed by the four supply cars and the No. 12 trailing locomotive, operated by Silas.\u00a0 At about 3:45 p.m., Shepherd entered the mine via the service hoist and met Allen and Silas at the bottom of the service shaft.\u00a0 Shepherd asked if he could ride as a passenger in one of the locomotives to the Main North 4 track, where he intended to begin his examination route along the belt entry.\u00a0 Investigators learned from interviews that it was common practice for examiners to ride with a locomotive crew or other vehicles traveling in and/or out of the mine on the track.At approximately 5:40 p.m., the train with Shepherd aboard departed on the Main North 3 track and headed inby. \u00a0Shepherd was riding in the passenger seat of the No. 12 trailing locomotive with Silas.\u00a0 The motor crew delivered the first flat car, containing oil and shearer bits, to the 17 East section.\u00a0 Leaving 17 East, the train stopped at the track switch at the mouth of the section (crosscut No. 44).\u00a0 Shepherd disembarked from the trailing locomotive in order to throw the track switch.\u00a0 He then changed his location on the train, boarding the lead locomotive and sat in the passenger seat.\u00a0 The train left the switch location and continued inby on the Main North 3 track.At approximately 6:25 p.m., the train reached the top of the grade on the Main North 3 track and turned east onto the East Main track, which has a descending grade in the direction of travel. \u00a0At crosscut No. 2, Allen signaled Silas to shift from first to second gear, and he did so.\u00a0 The No. 6 lead locomotive has 4 transmission speeds and the No. 12 trailing locomotive has 3 transmission speeds.\u00a0 When Silas felt the lead locomotive pulling him, he shifted into third gear.At crosscut No. 5, Silas decided that the train had gained too much speed, and he shifted back to second gear. \u00a0He locked his track sanders into the \u2018continuous open\u2019 position, which should have deposited sand onto the tracks and slowed the train.\u00a0 About the same time, Allen noticed the track was wet and slick. \u00a0He too began applying sand to the track using his sanders.Near crosscut No. 8, Allen felt his locomotive lose all traction. \u00a0He continued working his sanders and down-shifted the locomotive, but the train was soon out of control. \u00a0The train continued for 1,225 feet and, at about crosscut No. 16, Shepherd was either thrown or jumped from the No. 6 locomotive. \u00a0Allen and Silas did not witness Shepherd leaving the locomotive.Traveling at an excessive speed, the train continued about 175 feet to the curve at crosscut No. 17, where the East Main track turns into the Main North 4 track, and it derailed. \u00a0The lead locomotive came to rest completely off the track and in a crosscut.\u00a0 The ballast car and the No. 12 trailing locomotive remained on the track (see Appendix B).\u00a0Daniel Nantz, General Inside Laborer, was working at the East Main belt tailpiece.\u00a0 He heard the train wreck and went to investigate.\u00a0 Nantz spotted Allen in the deck of the lead locomotive and asked if he was okay. \u00a0Allen responded he was fine and requested Nantz to check on Silas and Shepherd. \u00a0Nantz found Silas sitting in the deck of his locomotive, shaken but uninjured. \u00a0Silas asked Nantz if he knew where Shepherd was located.\u00a0 He answered, \u201cNo.\u201d \u00a0After a quick search, Nantz\u00a0found Shepherd in crosscut No. 16 next to an electrical distribution box.\u00a0 He was unconscious and lying on his back, with his feet pointing toward the track.Nantz elevated Shepherd\u2019s head and gave support to stabilize his neck.\u00a0 Allen arrived at the scene and used his hand-held radio to call for help.\u00a0 He contacted Edwards to inform him of the accident.\u00a0 At approximately 6:30 p.m. Edwards contacted Greg Cox, Communication System Operator, who was on the surface.\u00a0 He told Cox that Shepherd had a head injury and needed an ambulance or possibly a medical helicopter.Gary Jenkins, Evening Shift Assistant Mine Foreman, heard the call for help over the radio. \u00a0Jenkins and his crew were in close proximity to the accident scene, so he notified Edwards they would travel to the location to assist. \u00a0According to mine tracking system records, Jenkins and his crew, consisting of Brad Kelley, General Inside Laborer, David Barnett, Belt Repairman, and Stephen Poe, Belt Repairman, arrived at Shepherd\u2019s location at 6:33 p.m. \u00a0They observed that Shepherd\u2019s condition was serious.\u00a0 Jenkins radioed Edwards to get an ambulance and hold the hoist at the bottom of the service shaft.At 6:37 p.m., Jenkins and his crew placed Shepherd on a track-mounted bus and began traveling toward the shaft bottom.\u00a0 Shepherd remained unconscious.\u00a0 They placed Shepherd in a Stokes basket, carried him to the hoist, and arrived on the surface at 7:13 p.m.Shepherd was loaded into an ambulance operated by Concord Fire and Rescue and transported to the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital.\u00a0 He was pronounced dead by Dr. Andrew Papoy, M.D., at 8:50 p.m.", "INVESTIGATION OF ACCIDENT": "At the time of the accident, Keith Chaney, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, had completed his inspection activities for the day and was at the surface preparing to leave the mine property.\u00a0 He was notified of the accident at approximately 6:40 p.m., and at 7:30 p.m., he issued a 103(k) order to preserve the accident scene and prevent the destruction of any evidence that would assist in the investigation.\u00a0 Cox called the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center at 6:57 p.m. to report the accident.\u00a0 The Contact Center contacted Russel Weekly, Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector. \u00a0Weekly called Danny Crumpton, Assistant District Manager (Enforcement), and notified him of the accident. \u00a0Crumpton assigned Philip Ingram and Darryl Allen, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspectors, and Weekly to investigate the accident.\u00a0 Ingram, Darryl Allen, and Weekly traveled to the mine site and were briefed by Chaney on the circumstances of the accident.The investigators conducted preliminary interviews at the North Portal mine office with persons having knowledge of the accident. \u00a0At the accident site, they conducted a survey of the equipment and structures involved and took photographs.\u00a0 In addition to the MSHA investigation team, the State of Alabama Department of Industrial Relations Mining and Reclamation Division, the UMWA, and mine management personnel participated in the investigation (see Appendix A). \u00a0On June 21 and 22, 2017, MSHA investigators made additional visits to the accident scene to gather evidence.MSHA and the State of Alabama conducted formal interviews on June 21, 27 and 28, 2017, at the Oak Grove mine office (see Appendix A).", "DISCUSSION": "Mine TrackInvestigators inspected the mine track rails on the East Main track following the accident. \u00a0The rails were wet from condensation.\u00a0 They found an accumulation of water, which was approximately \u00bd to 1 inch over the ball of the track rail at crosscut No. 8 for a span of 10 feet. \u00a0At the derailment location, the track\u2019s left and right rails under the inby end of the (4) ballast car had shifted 4 inches and 3 inches, respectively.\u00a0 Investigators concluded that the damage to the rails occurred during the derailment.Oak Grove Resources, LLC conducted a vertical profile survey of the East Main track grade.\u00a0 It found the grade averaged approximately 2.8% along the track where the operators noted problems in controlling the speed of the train.\u00a0 The steepest length of the track is on a 6.74% grade for a distance of approximately 80 feet.\u00a0 The flattest area along the track has a grade of 0.56% (see Appendix B).Diesel Locomotives and Supply CarsThe front No. 6 locomotive was a Brookville Model BDC-20UP, serial number 7929, 20 ton, manufactured in 1996.\u00a0 The operator and passenger seat were inspected and no deficiencies were observed (see Appendix C).\u00a0 A seatbelt or other restraint was not required and was not installed in the locomotive.\u00a0 The weight is listed as 40,575 pounds and it is 19 feet long and 7 feet wide.The weights and dimensions of the supply cars were as follows:(1) Flat car with two pallets of oil and shearer bits was dropped off on 18 East Section and was not involved in the accident; therefore the weight of that car was not measured.(2) Flat car, loaded with two pallets of oil, monorail hangers, and belt clips, weighed 12,378 pounds and was 16 feet long and 7 feet wide.(3) Flat car, loaded with six pallets of solid cinder blocks, two doors, one pallet of block sealant and one pallet of roof bolt resin, weighed 29,304 pounds and was 16 feet long and 7 feet wide.(4) Ballast gravel car, loaded, weighed 32,667 pounds and was 18 feet long and 7 feet wide.\u00a0The No. 12 trailing locomotive was an Irwin Model DH25, serial number 08407, 25 ton. \u00a0It had been rebuilt.\u00a0 The rebuild included installing different axles and service and parking brake systems.\u00a0 The operator and passenger seats were inspected and no deficiencies were observed.\u00a0 The rebuilt model weighed about 56,000 pounds and was 23 feet 8 inches long and 7 feet 8 inches wide. \u00a0The total weight of the locomotives, the two loaded flat cars and the ballast gravel car was 170,924 pounds (85.46 tons).\u00a0 The total length of the train, including the couplers was 99 feet long.Train CouplersThe investigators inspected the couplers to determine if any critical dimensions were out-of-tolerance.\u00a0 While the coupler that connected the No. 12 trailing locomotive and the ballast gravel car was out-of-tolerance due to an inadequate lock thickness, it was still coupled after the accident.\u00a0 As a result, investigators concluded that its condition did not contribute to this accident.\u00a0 All of the other train couplers were within the tolerance range.\u00a0 MSHA issued a non-contributory citation to the operator for violation of 30 CFR \u00a7 75.1725(a) because the train coupler\u2019s lock thickness was out-of-tolerance range.GearingInvestigators found the transmission gear selection lever in the No. 6 lead locomotive in the neutral position. \u00a0Because the lead locomotive derailed, the position of the gear lever could have been changed by the impact force resulting from the accident.\u00a0 The transmission gear selection lever in the No. 12 trailing locomotive was found in 2nd gear.Silas stated that the gearing of the No. 6 and No. 12 locomotives was different.\u00a0 The No. 12 locomotive typically had to be in one gear higher than the No. 6 locomotive to best keep the speed of the locomotives the same.\u00a0 For example, the No. 12 locomotive would have to be in 3rd gear, and the No. 6 locomotive would have to be in 2nd gear for the locomotives to best travel at the same speed. \u00a0Although the different gearing would not have been enough to cause the train to derail, it would have complicated the process for the operators to uniformly control the speed of the train.BrakesBoth locomotives are provided with service and parking brakes, but the two supply flatcars and ballast car are not equipped with braking systems.\u00a0 Using Brookville\u2019s operation and service manual, investigators tested the No. 6 locomotive, which was in front.\u00a0 They found that the braking systems did not work to stop the locomotive and were defective.\u00a0 However, because the operators did not use the service and parking brake systems to control the speed of the train, their condition did not contribute to the accident.\u00a0 MSHA issued a non-contributory citation for the defective service and parking brakes, a violation of 30 CFR \u00a7 75.1909(b)(7).Investigators also tested the brake systems on the No. 12 trailing locomotive and found they held the machine stationary.\u00a0 However, the rebuild of the locomotive had significantly changed the design of the service and parking brake systems so that a single failure of one service brake valve and air chamber would cause the loss of all service braking capability.\u00a0 Because this design did not meet the requirements of 30 CFR\u00a775.1909(b)(6), MSHA issued the operator a non-contributory citation.Locomotive Track SandersEach locomotive is equipped with four sand reservoirs to deposit sand on the rails.\u00a0 Two are located on the front, one on each side and two on the rear (see Appendix D). \u00a0Track sanders are designed to apply sand to the rails only in the direction of travel.\u00a0 These sanders are referred to as the \u2018front\u2019 sanders.\u00a0 For both the lead No. 6 locomotive, and the rear No. 12 locomotive investigators found that the left front sanders were inoperative due to blockages in the reservoirs.\u00a0 MSHA could not determine when these sanders became inoperative.The two right front sanders on each locomotive were working as required.\u00a0 With only two of the front four sanders functioning as intended, there was insufficient frictional force between the locomotive\u2019s wheels and the track rails to help slow the speed of the supply train.Pre-Operational Examination and MaintenanceSilas and Allen stated they conducted the pre-operational check of both locomotives prior to use, and one sander on the No. 12 locomotive was found inoperative.\u00a0 The sander was repaired and they did not detect any other issues with either locomotive.\u00a0 Investigators reviewed the maintenance records for the two locomotives.\u00a0 The maintenance records indicated that all hazards listed had been corrected.CommunicationThe main method of communication between locomotive operators\u00a0was a portable radio system.\u00a0 However, it did not provide a clear means of communication.\u00a0 When the train was in motion, the noise level of the running locomotives and other noises from the mine environment prevented audible broadcasts through the radio system.\u00a0 As a result, the operators were not able to share important information that would have assisted them in maintaining a safe speed on wet rails on a descending track grade.\u00a0 This includes better coordination to address the challenges presented by different gear ratios to control the supply train\u2019s speed. In addition, the mine did not have standardized visual or audible signaling systems in place that would have alerted the operators to observe track conditions and maintain a safe speed.Previously Issued SafeguardsIn 1986 and 1987, MSHA issued three safeguards to the mine operator:Safeguard 2812277, issued on August 5, 1986, states, in part:\u00a0 \u201c. . . No person, other than the motorman and brakeman should ride on a locomotive unless authorized by the mine foreman, and then only when safe riding facilities are provided. . . .\u201dSafeguard 2811430, issued on November 20, 1986, states, in part: \u201c. . . all track mounted personnel carriers shall be provided with a well maintained fully operational sanding device.\u201d\u00a0 After this safeguard was issued, MSHA wrote over 200 citations because the mine operator violated the safety criteria in this safeguard.Safeguard 2809080, issued on August 10, 1987, states in part: \u201c. . . Water shall not accumulate over the rails in track haulage entry where track mounted personnel carriers and locomotives are required to travel.\u201d \u00a0After this safeguard was issued, MSHA wrote over 100 citations because the mine operator violated the safety criteria in this safeguard.The operator disregarded these safeguards, and they were not reflected in any of its policies and procedures.\u00a0 The victim was not authorized to ride on any locomotive, the sanding device was not well maintained or fully operational, and at the time of the accident, water had accumulated over the rails.TrainingShepherd began working at this mine September 26, 2016, as a preshift examiner.\u00a0 Shepherd received experienced miner training and locomotive operations\u2019 task training on September 27, 2016.\u00a0 No training deficiencies were found during the investigation.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the investigation and the operator\u2019s implemented corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence of this type of accident.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator\u2019s policies and procedures did not ensure compliance with two previously issued safeguards.\u00a0 One safeguard requires that no person other than a motorman and brakeman ride in a locomotive without the mine foreman\u2019s authorization.\u00a0 The victim was riding in the locomotive without authorization from a mine foreman.\u00a0 The other safeguard requires that all track mounted personnel carriers be provided with a well maintained, fully operational sanding device.\u00a0 The two locomotives, involved in the accident, each have four sanders (total of eight).\u00a0 The left front sander on each locomotive was not fully operational.\u00a0 Non-functioning locomotive sanders contributed to the inability of the locomotive operators to control the speed of the supply train.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator implemented a new policy/procedure requiring locomotive operators to conduct a thorough pre-operational check, make a written record of the checks, and correct noted deficiencies before any locomotive is put into operation. \u00a0Miners were trained on the new policy/procedure, as well as on the two safeguards, and the operator kept a roster of attendees.\u00a0 MSHA personnel monitored the training. \u00a0Additionally, MSHA issued a new safeguard limiting the reasons why a passenger may ride on a locomotive.\u00a0 The new safeguard also requires additional training for those passengers.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator\u2019s policies and procedures did not ensure compliance with a previously issued safeguard (2809080) and the operator did not have an effective procedure in place to ensure that supply trains could operate safely in the section of the track where the fatality occurred.\u00a0 The safeguard requires that water shall not accumulate over the rails in track haulage entries where track mounted personnel carriers and locomotives are required to travel.\u00a0 Wet track rails and other factors contributed to the inability of the locomotive operators to maintain the supply train at a safe speed.\u00a0 These factors included:\u00a0 a descending track grade; the differences in the locomotives\u2019 gear ratios; locomotive track sanders not being fully operational; and the lack of standardized uniform communication between locomotive operators.\u00a0 All of these played a role in the train going out of control, which contributed to the mine examiner\u2019s accident and fatal injuries.\u00a0\nCorrective Action: \u00a0The mine operator implemented several written provisions/policies as corrective actions. \u00a0Daily reporting of track conditions by preshift examiners will be communicated to locomotive operators.\u00a0 Water over the track will be corrected prior to track mounted personnel carriers and locomotives traveling in those hazards areas.\u00a0 The track conditions, hazards noted, and their corrective actions will be recorded in the pre-shift reports.\u00a0 Signs were placed along mine track grades to alert locomotive operators to observe track conditions and maintain a safe speed.\u00a0 A risk assessment system was developed to determine the total safe train weight for specific mine grades and rail conditions.\u00a0 A leading and trailing locomotive system will be used at all times and the gear ratio between the two locomotives will be compatible.\u00a0 An effective standardized communication system between locomotive operators of supply trains was developed, and training on these new policies and procedures was conducted, and a roster kept by the operator.\u00a0 This training was monitored by MSHA personnel.\u00a0", "CONCLUSION": "On Monday, June 19, 2017, at approximately 6:27 p.m. CDT, a 32-year-old mine examiner with 8 years and 9 months of experience received fatal injuries when he was thrown or jumped from the passenger seat of a runaway locomotive supply train.\u00a0 The supply train, consisting of a lead locomotive, three supply cars, and a trailing locomotive, was traveling on a descending grade when the operators lost control of it.\u00a0 There were no witnesses to the victim\u2019s exit from the locomotive, and investigators were unable to determine whether he was thrown or jumped.\u00a0 After the victim exited, the train continued for about 175 feet and derailed.\u00a0 The victim was not authorized to ride as a passenger on any locomotive at the time of the accident.The fatal accident occurred because the mine operator did not comply with previously issued safeguards that prohibited unauthorized personnel from riding in the locomotives.\u00a0 The operator also allowed other hazardous conditions to exist.\u00a0 Water had accumulated over the track rails, and the track sanding devices for the locomotives were not maintained and functional.\u00a0 The locomotive operators were not able to control the speed of the supply train due to the combination of the track grade, the non-functioning locomotive track sanders, and the wet (slick) rails.\u00a0___________________________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 _________________Samuel R.

In addition, the PDS on this CMM had been set up in a manner that deactivated the visual or audible warnings when the ESO function overrode the PDS.", "GENERAL INFORMATION": "The Gateway Eagle Mine is an underground mine operated by Rockwell Mining, LLC, a subsidiary of Blackhawk Mining, LLC.\u00a0 The mine is located in Wharton, Boone County, West Virginia.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, the mine employed 112 miners, with 109 working underground.\u00a0 The mine operates in the Eagle coal seam (bituminous) with an average mining height of 84 inches.\u00a0 Laboratory analysis of air samples indicated no methane liberation in a 24-hour period.\u00a0 The mine operates four mechanized mining units (MMUs) on two separate working sections utilizing the room and pillar method of mining.\u00a0 Coal is mined with two CMMs on each working section and transported from the working faces to the section loading points by shuttle cars.\u00a0 From there, a belt conveyor system moves the coal to the surface.\u00a0 Diesel-powered rubber-tired personnel carriers are used to transport miners and materials into and out of the mine.The principal officers for the mine at the time of the accident were:Rex Osborne\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.General Mine Manager\nLuke Stepp\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Superintendent\nSteve Gibson\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Mine Foreman\nJustin Ray\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..Safety RepresentativeA regular (E01) safety and health inspection was started on April 3, 2017, and had not been completed when the accident occurred. \u00a0The previous regular inspection was completed on March 23, 2017.\u00a0 The non-fatal days lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for the mine in 2016 was 12.16, compared to the national NFDL rate of 3.41 for mines of this type.", "DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On June 13, 2017, Rodney S. Osborne arrived at the mine at approximately 11:00 a.m., four hours prior to his regular shift. \u00a0He was assigned to clean lifeline reflectors in the secondary escapeway from the No. 6 belt head to the No. 7 belt head.\u00a0 The electronic tracking system shows that R. S. Osborne returned to the surface and met his regular production crew at 2:36 p.m.\u00a0 At 3:01 p.m., the crew began traveling to the 010-0/011-0 MMU No. 1 working section.They arrived on the section at 3:36 p.m. and were met by Christopher Adkins, Section Foreman, who conducted a safety talk before instructing the crew to conduct pre-operational checks on their equipment.\u00a0 Adkins conducted an on-shift examination of the working places and assigned R. S. Osborne to the left side cut cycle for the day. \u00a0R. S. Osborne began the mining cycle operating the Company No. 254 CMM in the Upper 2 Left room. He then mined coal in the Lower 2 Left room and in the No. 3 entry (see Appendix B).Shortly before the accident, R. S. Osborne loaded the last coal of the cut in the No. 3 entry into the shuttle car operated by Densil Blankenship, Shuttle Car Operator.\u00a0 Before delivering the coal to the belt feeder, Blankenship decided to assist R. S. Osborne in moving the CMM to the next cut.\u00a0 He trammed the shuttle car two crosscuts outby, got out of the shuttle car and started walking toward the CMM when he saw R. S. Osborne on the inby end.\u00a0 He called out to R. S. Osborne but received no response. \u00a0As he got closer, he saw that R. S. Osborne was pinned between the coal rib and the right side cutter head of the CMM.Blankenship ran to the No. 2 entry and informed Steven Elswick and Jerrad Terrall, Roof Bolters, of the accident.\u00a0 Elswick immediately traveled to R. S. Osborne and checked for a pulse.\u00a0 He did not detect any vital signs.\u00a0 Before going to the accident scene, Terrall used the mine phone to call outside and request medical assistance.\u00a0 Daniel Moore, Roof Bolter, who was at the No. 4 entry, heard someone yelling for help and went to the scene.Blankenship then traveled outby one crosscut and informed Adkins of the accident.\u00a0 Adkins proceeded to the accident scene, where Elswick asked him to locate David Havey, CMM Operator (right side), who was in the No. 4 entry.\u00a0 When Havey arrived, he took the remote control transmitter from R. S. Osborne and moved the CMM to the left to free R. S. Osborne.\u00a0 Elswick, Terrall, and Moore supported R. S. Osborne and lowered him onto a backboard that had been delivered, along with first aid supplies, by Mark Stepp, Right Side Shuttle Car Operator.\u00a0 The miners detected no vital signs and the victim\u2019s injuries were extensive.\u00a0 They placed him on a diesel mantrip, which transported him to the surface at approximately 9:22 p.m.At 8:47 p.m., James Lovejoy, Mine Dispatcher, called 911 to report the accident. \u00a0The Boone County Ambulance Authority (BCAA) paramedics arrived at the mine at 9:15 p.m., and received R. S. Osborne when he arrived at the surface.\u00a0 After observing R. S. Osborne\u2019s condition, the paramedics contacted Medbase and at 9:47 p.m. were instructed by Dr. Marie Nowak, the physician on duty, to declare R. S. Osborne dead.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On June 13, 2017, at 8:51 p.m. Frank Javins, Evening Shift Mine Foreman, notified the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center of the accident.\u00a0 At 9:00 p.m., the DOL Contact Center notified Joey Presley, Staff Assistant, MSHA Coal District 4.\u00a0 Presley then contacted Tracy Calloway, Staff Assistant, MSHA Coal District 12, because the mine was under the jurisdiction of District 12.Calloway immediately notified the following MSHA Coal District 12 personnel:Brian Dotson, District Manager\nLarry E. Bailey, Assistant District Manager (Technical)\nNicholas Christian, Pineville Field Office Supervisor\nMark Muncy, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Accident Investigator, and\nRex Hampton, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Electrical Specialist.\nAt 10:25 p.m., Muncy and Christian arrived at the mine site, and Muncy issued a 103(k) order to Rex Osborne, General Mine Manager, to preserve the accident scene and to prevent the destruction of any evidence that would assist in determining the cause of the accident.\u00a0 Muncy and Christian reviewed mine records and conducted informal interviews with miners.\u00a0 They obtained written statements from some miners. Hampton and Bailey arrived at approximately 10:45 p.m.\u00a0 Hampton assisted in conducting initial interviews. \u00a0Officials from the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST) and company officials participated in the investigation (see Appendix A).Bailey, Christian, Muncy, and Hampton, along with representatives of WVOMHST, the mine operator, and representatives of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) traveled underground to investigate the accident scene.\u00a0 Muncy, Hampton, and Christian took photographs, and Muncy and Hampton took measurements to compose a sketch of the scene (see Appendix B).\u00a0 Muncy asked Rex Osborne to contact CMM manufacturer Joy Global, Inc. and PDS manufacturer Matrix Design Group to have them download recorded data from the PDS installed on the No. 254 CMM.On June 14, 2017, Jonathan Cline, MSHA Roof Control Specialist/Civil Engineer, tested the PDSs on CMMs not involved in the accident.\u00a0 He performed static and dynamic testing of the PDS on the No. 262 CMM and the No. 253 CMM at different locations underground.\u00a0 Cline was unable to perform testing on the No. 252 CMM due to a maintenance issue. The PDS on the No. 253 and 262 CMMs operated correctly when tested.On June 15, 2017, representatives from Joy Global, Inc. and Matrix Design Group recovered the data from the PDS for all the CMMs. \u00a0Following further refinement, the recovered data for the No. 254 CMM was turned over to MSHA by the mine operator on June 23, 2017.Matt Wharry and Patrick Retzer, MSHA Technical Support Engineers, conducted static and dynamic testing of the No. 254 CMM on June 15, 2017.\u00a0 Muncy, Hampton, Dotson, and Calloway, along with representatives from the WVOMHST, the company and UMWA, observed the testing.MSHA and WVOMHST conducted formal interviews of miners on June 19, 2017, at the MSHA Coal District 4 Madison Field Office in Uneeda, WV, and on June 30, 2017 at the MSHA Coal District 12 Office in Pineville, WV.\u00a0On June 21, 2017, Bruce Linville, Educational Field and Small Mine Services (EFSMS) reviewed the mine operator\u2019s training records at the mine.\u00a0 As a result, MSHA issued two noncontributory citations for inadequate record keeping for violating 30 CFR 48.3(c)(3) and 48.9(a).", "DISCUSSION": "Accident SceneThe accident occurred on the left side (010-0 MMU) of the 010-0/011-0 MMU No.1 working section, in the No. 3 Entry, approximately 12.5 feet inby the last open crosscut, along the right rib.\u00a0 Entries Nos. 1, 2, and 3, and the associated crosscuts and rooms, made up MMU 010-0.\u00a0 All other entries and crosscuts were a part of MMU 011-0.\u00a0 The mine floor in the area was wet with a small ledge on the left side of the entry, which was not a factor in the accident.\u00a0 The CMM was trammed numerous times in this area during the investigation with no adverse effects.\u00a0 The width of the entry at the location of the accident measured approximately 19 feet wide by 8 feet high.\u00a0 After the victim was removed, the cutter head of the CMM was located 12.5 inches from the right coal rib (see Appendix C).Continuous Mining MachineThe No. 254 CMM was manufactured by Joy Global Inc., Serial Number JM5801, Model 14CM15. \u00a0The MSHA approval number is 2G-4159A-0.\u00a0 MSHA personnel conducted visual examinations and basic functional tests on this CMM, along with the remote control transmitter, including tram and hydraulic functions.\u00a0 These visual examinations and basic functional tests revealed no deficiencies.Proximity Detection SystemThe PDS is designed to prevent injury by activating audio and visual warnings when a miner approaches a CMM and stopping movement before contact is made.At the time of the accident, all CMMs in operation on the coal producing sections of the mine had a PDS.\u00a0 The No. 254 CMM had a Joy SmartZone Generation 2 PDS manufactured by Matrix Design Group. \u00a0It was installed by Joy Global Inc. during a rebuild before the CMM was placed into service at the mine on February 3, 2017.The PDS uses an electromagnetic field and a line of sight radio signal to allow communication between components that are permanently installed on the CMM and those worn by a miner. \u00a0When the miner wearable component (MWC) enters a certain area in the electromagnetic field, the machine-mounted components and MWC recognize the intrusion and relay the appropriate signal to the system.The PDS on the CMM is set up to identify warning and shutdown zones.\u00a0 If a miner enters the warning zone, a yellow light flashes at all four corners of the CMM and the MWC flashes a yellow light and sounds a slow beeping signal.\u00a0 If a miner enters the shutdown zone, a red light flashes at all four corners of the CMM and the MWC flashes a red light with a fast beeping signal, and the tram and conveyor boom swing functions of the CMM are disabled. \u00a0In addition, when electronic communication or MWC with CMM operator-association is lost, the PDS will disable the CMM tram and conveyor swing functions.The PDS and MWCs for the CMMs were examined by the investigation team, which found no physical damage or abnormalities that would affect the ability of the PDS to stop the machine before contacting a miner.\u00a0 Data retrieved from the PDS on the No. 254 CMM indicated that the victim\u2019s MWC was properly communicating with the PDS.\u00a0 Static measurements and dynamic tests of the PDS indicated the CMM would stop before contacting a miner (see Appendix D).Proximity Detection System OverrideThe emergency stop override (ESO) function is activated by a switch on the remote control transmitter used to operate the CMM.Under MSHA\u2019s proximity detection standard (Title 30 CFR \u00a7 75.1732), the only reason to override the PDS is to move a disabled CMM from an unsafe location for the purpose of repair.\u00a0 Additionally, \u00a7 75.1732(b)(4) of the rule requires an audible or visual warning signal to be activated when the PDS is being overridden.\u00a0However, the No. 254 CMM was configured so that when the override was engaged, the warning signals ceased functioning.\u00a0 When investigators used the ESO to override the PDS, they confirmed there was no audible or visual warning signal.\u00a0 Investigators learned that Joy Global Inc. had set up or commissioned the PDS to operate this way on the No. 254 CMM and the three other CMMs on the working sections in the mine.\u00a0 MSHA issued noncontributing citations for the other three CMMs because \u00a7 75.1732(b)(4) was violated.In order to determine the sequence of events before and during the accident the data from the No. 254 CMM was converted to accelerometer graphs and recorded playback of the computer simulation tool.\u00a0 Also, logs were made of MWC associations and the ESO activation times. \u00a0Investigators found that the victim activated the ESO six times in the 16 minutes he operated the No. 254 CMM before the accident.\u00a0 The victim was in the Red Zone three of those times.MSHA Technical Support investigators determined that the victim engaged the ESO for the last time at 8:43 p.m. EDT.\u00a0 For the next 14 seconds, the ESO remained engaged while the MWC moved along the right side of the machine and into the shutdown zone. The movement stopped near the right side of the cutter head.\u00a0 The data is consistent with the MWC being worn by the victim while he was walking along the right side of the CMM as described.For approximately seven more minutes, the CMM remained energized while the graphs and playback show no movement of the MWC.\u00a0 This indicated to investigators that the victim was struck at 8:43 p.m., and the MWC he was wearing did not move after he was struck.At 8:47 p.m., other MWCs started to appear around the No. 254 CMM, and limited movement of the victim\u2019s MWC began at 8:50 pm.\u00a0 At 9:02 p.m., the victim\u2019s MWC, accompanied by other MWCs, traveled outby the CMM and out of range.\u00a0 This information is consistent with facts gathered by investigators concerning the events that took place after the accident when miners gathered at the scene, recovered the victim, and transported him away from the working section.The data revealed that the ESO was used 87 times from the beginning of the shift until the time of the accident, totaling over 57 minutes during the shift.\u00a0 It was used approximately 1,000 times in the week prior to the accident, totaling 14 hours and 53 minutes.\u00a0 This data indicate the ESO was used frequently to override the PDS and was a common practice during regular production shifts.\u00a0In interviews, CMM operators Casey Harris, Stacey Harris, and William Daniels stated the ESO was being misused to save time while moving CMMs from one place to another, and mine management was aware of it.In contrast, Adkins; Steve Gibson, Mine Foreman; Charles Maynard, 2nd Shift Chief Electrician; George Jones, 3rd Shift Maintenance Foreman; and Delano Kirby, No. 1 Section Dayshift Foreman said they were not aware that the ESO was being used to override the PDS in nonemergency situations.InterferenceSources of interference were investigated and none contributed to the fatal accident.Testing and ExaminationThe mine operator\u2019s examination records indicate that a pre-shift examination is conducted three times per day on the 010-0/011-0 MMU\u2019s No.1 working section.\u00a0 The pre-shift and the on-shift examination records did not show any hazards or violations for the day of the accident.\u00a0 The last weekly examination of the No. 254 CMM was conducted on June 5, 2017, which indicated that a trailing cable splice had been repaired.\u00a0 No other hazards or violations were reported.Based on testimony of the CMM operators, only static testing of the PDS was being conducted prior to the operation of the CMMs on both working sections.\u00a0 Because no dynamic testing was being conducted prior to the accident, a noncontributory citation was issued for violating 30 CFR \u00a7 75.1732(c)(1)(i).Roof Control PlanThe mine\u2019s roof control plan, which was approved by MSHA on February 22, 2017, contains provisions for Red Zone protection.\u00a0 The following requirements for safe operating of the CMM are under the heading \u201cContinuous Miner Tramming:\u201d \u00a0When the continuous miner is being trammed anywhere in the mine, other than when cutting or loading coal, no person shall be allowed along either side of the CMM.\nDuring mining and place changing with the remote control miners: all persons shall be positioned in an area that will afford maximum protection to themselves and others from unsupported roof and moving equipment.\n\u200bDuring place changing, all persons involved in the move shall be positioned in an area outside the Red Zone of the continuous miner at all times while the miner is being trammed.\u00a0 If an operator\u2019s compartment is provided and a cab or canopy is required due to the mining height, then the continuous miner shall be trammed from the compartment.\nRed Zone Precautions: \u00a0Continuous Miner Tramming states:\u00a0 When tramming the CMM to the next place, other than when cutting or loading coal, no one will be located along either side of the CMM, and they will be in a safe location outby the boom and head.\u00a0 All personnel shall remain at least 4 feet outside the Red Zone in all directions.\nTraining and ExperienceR. S. Osborne had 9 years, 13 weeks, and 5 days total mining experience. He began working at the Gateway Eagle Mine on January 25, 2017.\u00a0 R. S. Osborne was assigned to operate the No. 254 CMM on March 10, 2017.\u00a0 R. S. Osborne received experienced miner training on January 26, 2017, and annual refresher training on April 1, 2017.The mine operator did not task train R. S. Osborne on the safety aspects and safe operating procedures of the CMM, which included PDS and the ESO, as required by 30 CFR \u00a748.7. \u00a0Proper task training would have included the procedures found in the Joy Mining Machinery Remote Operation manual:\u00a0Before starting this machine or operating any controls, make certain you have read the Machine Operation book, found in the Introduction unit of the manual, have been trained in the proper operation of this machine, and are thoroughly familiar with all controls. \u00a0Failure to do so could result in an accident causing serious injury or death to you or other personnel.The manual also contains a warning statement about the use of the ESO and notes that this statement \u201ccall(s) attention to potentially hazardous situations that could result in serious personal injury or death if not avoided. \u00a0Injury from these hazards is usually serious in nature, and a severe or fatal accident can occur if proper precautions are not followed.\u201d\u00a0 Specifically, the warning statement states:Only use the emergency stop override to tram the machine away from the obstruction that is pressing the EMERGENCY STOP switch. \u00a0Never use the override during normal operation. \u00a0Failure to comply with this warning may lead to an accident causing severe accident or death from attempting to stop the machine, in an emergency, with an overridden EMERGENCY STOP switch.The victim was using the ESO during normal operations when he was fatally injured.\u00a0 In witness interviews, C. Harris, S. Harris, and William Daniels stated the mine operator did not address the safety aspects and safe work procedures of using the ESO during their task training.The preamble to the final PDS rule issued in January, 2015 emphasizes that required task training must include training on overriding the PDS:Overriding the proximity detection system should only occur for the time necessary to move the machine to a safe location\u2026Mine operators must train machine operators, under existing new task training requirements, to relocate a machine to a safe location for repair.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the root causes identified during the investigation and the operator\u2019s implemented corrective actions to prevent a reoccurrence of this type of accident.1.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not enforce provisions set forth in the approved Roof Control Plan to prevent miners from working or traveling in the Red Zone of the CMM while it is being moved from place to place or repositioning between cuts.\u00a0 The safety provisions are designed to ensure that miners do not enter dangerous areas that present hazards, such as the Red Zone established around the CMM.Corrective Action:\u00a0 Management developed an action plan to increase Red Zone safety awareness, and upon approval by MSHA, implemented the plan.\u00a0 The provisions to the action plan include Red Zone training, proximity detection training, increased observations, and dynamic testing procedures.\u00a0 The action plan requires all miners to receive classroom and underground training regarding potential Red Zone hazards and the operation of the PDS on the CMMs. The action plan also requires a certified foreman to observe each CMM operator during place changes and record the results of the observations in a book on the surface.\u00a0 Additionally, the operator revised its roof control plan to include training, observations, and PDS testing to follow Joy Global Inc.\u2019s Smart Zone Proximity Systems User Guide when conducting static and dynamic testing.2.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator allowed a practice of using the ESO to override the PDS during movement of CMMs in nonemergency situations.Corrective Action:\u00a0 Management submitted an updated training plan to include proximity training to new miners and experienced miners, and to provide task training on the PDS to all miners working at the mine, which includes Joy Global, Inc.\u2019s recommended testing procedures.\u00a0 Management also implemented an emergency stop override policy, which states:Except in the case of an imminent danger to the health and safety of a miner, continuous miner operators SHALL NOT utilize the ESO or other equivalent override procedures for continuous miners at any time unless:\nThe continuous miner operator obtains verbal permission from Mine Management, such as Section Foremen or other appropriate mine management personnel; AND\nMine management must observe the continuous mining machine operator engage the ESO or other equivalent override procedures for continuous mining machines to ensure safe procedures.", "CONCLUSION": "The CMM operator was fatally injured when he was pinned between the cutter head of a remote controlled CMM and the coal rib.\u00a0 The accident occurred because the mine operator did not enforce the provisions in its approved roof control plan to prevent miners from working or traveling in the Red Zone of the CMM while moving from place to place or repositioning between cuts.\u00a0 In addition, the mine operator did not provide administrative controls and acceptable work practices to prevent the proximity detection system from being overridden during normal mining operations.The victim was using the emergency stop override at the time of the accident and had activated it 87 times for over 57 minutes during the shift.\u00a0 Furthermore, the PDS on this mining machine was set up or commissioned by Joy Global Inc. in a manner that deactivated the audible or visual warnings when the PDS was being overridden.Approved By:\u00a0__________________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ________________Brian M.

in the Red Zone.3.104(d)(1) Citation, No. 8068575, was issued to Rockwell Mining, LLC for a violation of 30 CFR \u00a7 75.1732(b).\u00a0On June 13, 2017, at approximately 8:43 p.m., a fatal accident occurred on the No. 1 working section, (010-0/011-0 MMU).\u00a0 A continuous mining machine operator was pinned between the mining machine\u2019s right side cutter head and the coal rib while moving the mining machine from the No. 3 entry into the last open crosscut. \u00a0The mine operator did not ensure that the emergency stop override on the No. 254 continuous mining machine, Serial #JM5801, was only used for purposes of relocating the machine from an unsafe location for repair.\u00a0 Instead, the emergency stop override was being used by the operator during the movement of the continuous mining machine from one location to another during the mining cycle.\u00a0 This action overrides the proximity detection system (PDS) and prevents the system from preventing tram and conveyor boom swing on the continuous mining machine while the operator is positioned in the shutdown zone.\u00a0 During the investigation, MSHA Technical Support personnel determined that the emergency stop override of the No. 254 continuous mining machine was used approximately 1,000 times in the week prior to the accident.\u00a0 Additionally, it was determined that the emergency stop override was used 87 times on June 13, 2017 between 3:50:00 PM and 8:43:56 PM.\u00a0 The total time the continuous mining machine operated in emergency stop override during this period was 57 minutes and 4 seconds.\u00a0 Based on the amount of times the emergency stop override was activated, mine management had reason to know the emergency stop override was being used for reasons other than relocating the continuous mining machine from an unsafe location for repair only.\u00a0 Therefore, the mine operator also had reason to know the audible or visual alarm did not activate when the proximity detection system (PDS) was being overridden by emergency stop override.During the fatal accident investigation, MSHA determined there was a practice of continuous mining machine operators tramming the CMM from place to place, while they were positioned in the PDS shutdown which is located in the Red Zone.4.104(d)(1) Order, No. 8068576 was issued to Rockwell Mining, LLC for a violation of 30 CFR

Lester used the No. 13 jeep to travel back to the locomotive.\u00a0 Rosser and T. Lester then got in the locomotive to travel to the elevator and out of the mine.At approximately 11:00 p.m., while Rosser was operating the locomotive along the 8 haulage extension track, the trolley pole came off the trolley wire near the No. 42 crosscut.\u00a0 While the locomotive was still in motion, Rosser rose from his seat to place the trolley pole back on the wire. \u00a0He sat back down just as the overhead clearance dropped abruptly from 15 feet to 53\u00bd inches. \u00a0A steel beam used as supplemental roof support knocked off Rosser\u2019s hard hat, and as he reached to grab it, his head hit an outby steel beam.\u00a0 Lester stated the locomotive came to a complete stop at the No. 39 crosscut and he noticed Rosser was unconscious.With his caplight, Lester signaled Dodson and Muncy who were riding in the No. 13 jeep on their way out of the mine.\u00a0 They stopped approximately 3 crosscuts in front of the locomotive.\u00a0 Lester then ran to Muncy and Dodson to inform them Rosser had hit his head and was unconscious.\u00a0 Lester, Dodson, and Muncy traveled back to No. 39 crosscut to see if Rosser had regained consciousness.\u00a0 They removed him from the locomotive and laid him on the mine floor.\u00a0 Muncy performed artificial respiration on Rosser while Dodson used ammonia inhalants; however, Rosser did not respond.As Muncy assessed Rosser\u2019s condition, T. Lester used a two-way radio to call the surface; he notified Jeff Davis, Dispatcher, that Rosser was hurt and unconscious.\u00a0 Davis immediately informed Lanny Cline, Evening Shift Foreman, of the accident. \u00a0At 11:09 p.m., he called 911 to request an ambulance.\u00a0 L. Cline also spoke with Lester on the two-way radio and was advised that Rosser was \u201cknocked out.\u201d \u00a0In his interview, L. Cline stated he heard Dodson say on the radio that Rosser had a faint pulse.\u00a0At about 11:13 p.m., L. Cline told Calvin Roark, Cody Thompson, and Terry McGinnis, Outby Utility Miners, who were \u00a0on the No. 36 mantrip and close to the accident area, to assist with Rosser.\u00a0 When these three miners arrived at the scene of the accident, they assisted Dodson, Muncy, and Lester in placing Rosser in the mantrip, which then proceeded to the elevator.\u00a0 L. Cline also asked Davis to contact G. Cline, Travis Grimmett, Mine Examiner, and James Mullins, Mine Examiner/ Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), and direct them to meet the No. 36 mantrip and assist with Rosser.\u00a0At approximately 11:30 p.m., Mullins, Grimmett, and G. Cline met the utility crew at the No. 134 crosscut.\u00a0 Grimmett and Mullins got on the mantrip and immediately began to perform CPR on Rosser.\u00a0 Thompson also stayed on the mantrip and held Rosser\u2019s head while the mantrip traveled toward the elevator.At 11:30 p.m., STAT Emergency Medical Service paramedics, Chad Cox and Samuel Brown, arrived at the mine.\u00a0 After they arrived on the surface with Rosser at about midnight, the paramedics placed him in the ambulance and continued to administer emergency treatment. \u00a0The ambulance left the mine at 12:25 a.m. on May 19, 2017, and arrived at Welch Community Hospital in Welch, West Virginia at 12:45 a.m.\u00a0 Rosser was pronounced dead by Dr. Anwar Abdeen at 12:50 a.m.\u00a0", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "\u00a0On May 18, 2017, at 11:28 p.m., Kenneth Nunn, Safety Specialist, called the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center to report a life threatening injury at the Pinnacle mine. \u00a0The Contact Center notified Kenneth Butcher, Logan Field Office Supervisor, at 11:38 p.m. who immediately called Tracy Calloway, Staff Assistant.\u00a0 Calloway notified Steven Campbell, Ventilation Specialist/Accident Investigator, of the accident. \u00a0Campbell arrived at the mine at 1:11 a.m. on May 19, 2017, and immediately issued a 103(k) order to preserve the accident scene and to prevent the destruction of evidence.\u00a0Campbell conducted informal interviews at the mine office with miners who assisted the victim.\u00a0 Clark Blackburn, Assistant District Manager (Enforcement), and Landon Grimmett, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Accident Investigator, arrived at the mine at 1:50 a.m. to assist Campbell with the investigation.\u00a0 Officials with the West Virginia Office of Miners Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST) and company officials participated in the investigation (see Appendix A).On May 19, 2017, Educational Field and Small Mine Services dispatched John M. Browning, Training Specialist, to the mine to review training records and the company\u2019s training plan.On May 24, 2017, and June 21, 2017, MSHA and WVOMHST jointly conducted formal interviews at MSHA\u2019s District 12 Office in Pineville, West Virginia, (see Appendix A).", "DISCUSSION": "", "Equipment Involved": "The No. 43 Goodman 20 ton electric locomotive, serial number 437004, an electro-pneumatic controlled, 300 VDC trolley-powered, track-mounted vehicle, is used to transport supplies in and out of the mine and is capable of seating 2 persons.\u00a0 The locomotive has three types of brakes: dynamic brake, air brakes, and manual linkage.\u00a0 On the evening of the accident, the locomotive was examined by MSHA investigators and no deficiencies were observed with the braking system, sanders, the operational controls, or the trolley pole. \u00a0The headlights were operating properly and investigators found no deficiencies with lighting or visibility.\u00a0 Speed did not appear to be a factor in this accident.Investigators examined the 8 haulage extension track, which is an 85 lb haulage track rail system and the 300 VDC trolley wire in the area where the accident occurred and found no deficiencies.\u00a0 The incline of the track between crosscuts No. 41 and No. 42 measured 1.91% grade.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, the track was wet due to condensation.\u00a0 Investigators examined the trolley wire at the accident scene and there was nothing to indicate why the trolley pole came off the wire at this location.\u00a0 The operator had posted low clearance signs measuring only 3 inches by 3 inches approximately 4 crosscuts from the accident area. \u00a0The distance between the steel beams in the accident area and the windshield of the No. 43 locomotive measures between 10 inches and 14 inches.\u00a0 Rosser would have had to lower his head by bending or leaning over to prevent his head from contacting the steel beams (see Appendices B and C).\u00a0", "Examination": "The mine operator\u2019s examination records indicate the 8 haulage extension track was being examined each shift.\u00a0 The examination records for the day of the accident did not reveal any hazards or violations. \u00a0No hazards were documented in the weekly examination record for the No. 43 electric locomotive.", "Previously Issued Safeguard": "At the time of the accident, safeguard no. 3991332, issued August 21, 2013, was in effect.\u00a0 This safeguard was issued after a similar accident occurred at the mine.\u00a0 In that accident, a miner hit his head on the mine roof in a low area of the track haulageway and received permanently disabling injuries as a result; he is now partially paralyzed.\u00a0 The safeguard provided that all miners who operate track mounted vehicles be thoroughly trained in their operation. It also required the mine operator to implement a track haulage training plan.\u00a0 Management stated in their interview that they probably did not instruct any foreman or anyone else to cover the safeguard or the track haulage training plan when conducting task training. The operator\u2019s plan states:No person shall operate a portal bus or jeep unless he has been thoroughly trained in the safety standards governing the operation of the same.\nPersons riding mantrips shall not expose themselves to injury by raising up or projecting their arms or legs over the sides of the bus or jeep.\nMantrips shall be operated at speeds consistent with the conditions of the haulage road and shall be kept under control at all times.\nMantrips and or jeeps shall slow down at all curves, active turnouts, blind spots and close clearance areas along haulage roads.\nPersons shall ride only in vehicle compartments provided for that purpose.\u00a0 Riding on top of locomotives, portal busses, flat cars or other equipment not designated to accommodate riders, is strictly prohibited.\nWe will place a STOP:\u00a0 LOW TOP AHEAD PROCEED WITH CAUTION sign near the sizer\nInvestigators learned that standing and grabbing the trolley pole, while the vehicle was in motion, was a common practice at the mine.\u00a0 Policies and the safeguard issued by MSHA designed to prevent this practice were not followed at the mine.", "Experience and Training": "Rosser began employment at this mine on March 6, 2017, the same day he received annual refresher training.\u00a0 Some of the track haulage safety provisions of safeguard no. 3991332 and the operator\u2019s track haulage training plan were in the training documents used during the training.Rosser was task trained on the same type of locomotive involved in the fatal accident.\u00a0 Investigators determined that the task training given to Rosser was inadequate.\u00a0 Rosser was only trained on the controls of the locomotive as well as the sanders and horn.\u00a0 30 CFR \u00a7 48.7(a) requires task training to include:Supervised practice during nonproduction. \u00a0The training shall include supervised practice in the assigned tasks, and the performance of work duties at times or places where production is not the primary objective;

located near Colstrip, Montana. \u00a0Overburden is removed exposing the Rosebud coal seam utilizing four draglines and is deposited in previously mined pit areas. \u00a0The coal is loaded by front-end loaders into 100 ton and 200 ton haul trucks for transport to areas where the coal is stockpiled. \u00a0The coal seam averages 20 to 25 feet in thickness and overburden thicknesses vary from 20 feet to more than 200 feet.The mine employs 370 miners and operates seven days a week, with two 12 hour production shifts and two 12 hour maintenance shifts per day.\u00a0 \u00a0The mine produces

this type.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "Haul truck driver Michael Ramsey arrived for work on Saturday, May 6, 2017, at 6 a.m. He was a member of Crew 3, along with haul truck drivers Rob Moore and Matt Nelson. \u00a0\u00a0The three drivers received instructions for their shift from Ed Buchholz, Crew 4 Supervisor, who worked the night shift.\u00a0 They were assigned to haul overburden from the Cat 993 loader number LD 11 and dump it into the pit between the C-1 South and B-9 ramps.\u00a0 The drivers got to their equipment at approximately 6:15 a.m. \u00a0Ramsey performed a pre-operational examination on his Caterpillar 777F haul truck, and the documentation shows he did not detect any safety defects or other issues with the truck.The shift progressed normally, with all three trucks dumping their loads at the same dump point.\u00a0 The trucks dumped approximately 300 loads, when at approximately 4:40 p.m., Ramsey\u2019s truck was loaded with 98 tons of overburden.\u00a0 Ramsey drove to the dump but did not return to the loader.\u00a0 At about 4:50 p.m., Moore, whose truck was next in the loading cycle, approached the dump point at the crest of the highwall and noticed a section of the berm was gone. \u00a0He dumped his 100 ton load short to block the gap in the berm. \u00a0He then radioed Nelson to inform him that the berm was gone and that he had dumped his load short.Rich Hart, Loader Operator, noticed Ramsey was missing from the rotation and asked over the radio if anyone knew Ramsey\u2019s location.\u00a0 Nelson arrived at the dumping location and saw a haul truck upside down at the bottom of the pit.\u00a0 He radioed Stephan Hanson, Gate Guard, and requested he announce a \u201cmayday\u201d over the radio and give out the accident location.\u00a0 At 5:00 p.m. Hanson announced the mayday over all mine radio channels and he called 911 for assistance.\u00a0 \u00a0Charlie Charette, Crew 3 Supervisor in Areas A, B, and D, and James Fulkerson, Crew 3 Supervisor in Area C, heard Hanson say over the radio that a truck went over the highwall.David Murch, Bulldozer Operator, arrived on the scene at the top of the highwall.\u00a0 He tried to communicate verbally with Ramsey but did not receive any response. \u00a0Charette traveled to the bottom of the pit in an attempt to get to Ramsey.\u00a0 Charette was only able to get within several hundred feet of the truck because of water in the bottom of the pit.\u00a0 He contacted two bulldozer operators in the area to travel to the spoil side of the pit and start building a road to the truck.Troy Cozzens, Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) and Rescue Team Member (RTM), and Jason Serrano, RTM, arrived at the top of the highwall. \u00a0Cozzens rappelled over the wall and was the first person to reach the haul truck location.\u00a0 He found Ramsey unresponsive. \u00a0Cozzens informed Serrano they would need additional assistance. \u00a0Cozzens removed Ramsey\u2019s seatbelt and lowered him to the roof of the haul truck to check for vitals. \u00a0Cameron Ator, RTM, arrived to help Cozzens and they started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), continuing the procedure for about 30 minutes. There was no response from the victim.\u00a0 Meryl Young, RTM, also arrived with necessary equipment to rescue Ramsey.Dan Allerdings, EMT and RTM, stayed at the top of the highwall to communicate with Colstrip Ambulance personnel who arrived at the top of the highwall at 5:27 p.m. \u00a0Shawn Haig, Colstrip Ambulance Attendant, contacted Dr. Jose Ortiz at the Colstrip Medical Clinic to inform him of the 30 minutes of CPR and that Ramsey had not responded. \u00a0Dr. Ortiz instructed Haig to cease further resuscitation and recover the victim. \u00a0Haig relayed the information to the rescue team.Cozzens, Serrano, and Young secured Ramsey to a backboard at the truck. \u00a0Ramsey was then lifted out of the pit.\u00a0 Alan Fulton, Rosebud County Coroner, arrived at the mine and pronounced Ramsey dead at 7:25 p.m.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On May 6, 2017, at 5:43 p.m., Charette notified the Department of Labor (DOL) National Contact Center that a serious accident had occurred at Rosebud Mine & Crusher/Conveyor.\u00a0 MSHA issued a noncontributory citation for a violation of \u00a7 30 CFR 50.10 because the mine operator did not contact MSHA immediately, at once, without delay, and within 15 minutes.William Vetter, Coal District 9 Health Supervisor, was notified by the Contact Center of the accident on the district\u2019s emergency cell phone at 5:58 p.m.\u00a0 At 6:32 p.m., he issued a 103(j) order over the telephone to Walt Shaw, Maintenance Superintendent, to preserve the accident scene.David Hamilton, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Accident Investigator, and James Branson, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, were dispatched from the Gillette, Wyoming Field Office to the mine. \u00a0When they arrived, they modified the 103(j) order to a 103(k) order.\u00a0 They also took preliminary statements from persons having knowledge of the facts and circumstances concerning the accident and conducted a preliminary investigation of the scene.On May 7, 2017, Hamilton and Branson examined the existing physical conditions at the accident scene. \u00a0They also took digital photographs and relevant measurements of the scene and reviewed training, mine examination, equipment, and maintenance records. \u00a0MSHA held formal interviews at the mine on May 7, 2017.\u00a0 Additional interviews were conducted on May 9, 10, 11, 16, and 18, 2017 (see Appendix A).\u00a0 The investigation was conducted in conjunction with the company, the miners\u2019 representative, and the State of Montana Safety and Health Bureau, Mine Section.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of Accident, Conditions, and Dump PracticeThe truck went over the highwall in Area B between the C-1 south ramp and B-9 ramp (see Appendix B). \u00a0The highwall is at the boundary line of the mine permit. \u00a0The haul road on top of the highwall is 50 feet wide. \u00a0The haul trucks were using a right hand traffic pattern traveling east to west along the highwall edge.\u00a0 When the trucks reached the dump location they would turn left, backup to the edge, and dump over a berm.\u00a0 The berm, which consisted of soil and clay, was located at the edge of the highwall and measured four foot eight inches high by five foot six inches wide.The ground where the truck was dumping failed, creating an opening at the edge of the highwall causing the truck to fall.\u00a0 The opening was approximately 24 feet wide and extended up to 10 feet back from the edge of the highwall.\u00a0 The operating width of a Cat 777 truck is 21 feet 4 inches.Company Policies and Unsafe Dump PracticesThe dump practice described above did not comply with Western Energy Company\u2019s safety manual and standard operating guideline, which state:Safety manual (2014) excerpt 6.23:No equipment shall work on top of the highwall within twenty five (25) feet of the vertical un-shot edge and at no time shall the equipment move or work parallel within twenty-five (25) feet of the edge.Standard Operating Guideline (March 3, 2014):When dumping off a highwall, end dumps should dump short, with the bulldozers pushing material off of the highwall until a dump point can be solidly established on spoil material.Investigators learned that unsafe dump practices were commonly performed by several crews, including the victim\u2019s crew.\u00a0 These crews routinely operated equipment within 25 feet of the highwall, and their trucks did not dump short so that bulldozers could push overburden over the highwall.\u00a0 If trucks dumped short, overburden material would have been present more than 25 feet from the highwall.\u00a0 Investigators did not find overburden material in this location.At the time of the accident, no bulldozer was being used to push overburden over the highwall, and from interviews, investigators learned that the bulldozer closest to the accident site was approximately 1,300 feet away from the highwall.\u00a0 The 25-foot provision was also listed in the mine operator\u2019s safety program (required by 30 CFR \u00a7 77.1708).On Thursday, May 4, 2017, two days before the accident, Alan Raymond, Motor Grader Operator and Miners\u2019 Representative, observed tire marks in a berm at the highwall 200 feet from the accident scene.\u00a0 This indicated to him that unsafe dumping practices were occurring at this location. \u00a0He believed trucks were repeatedly pounding into the berms when dumping, causing the berms to be pushed back toward the edge of the highwall, to the point where the berms were in danger of giving way or failing.\u00a0 Raymond believed a miner would get hurt or die if this practice continued.\u00a0 He immediately exercised the mine operator\u2019s \u201cstop work authority\u201d provision and informed E. Buchholz, the Crew 4 Supervisor, of his concerns regarding the unsafe practice and the potential injury or death to a miner.\u00a0 Western Energy Company\u2019s safety manual states the following regarding stop work authority:Western Energy Company expects each employee to accept the responsibility for his or her own personal safety, as well as the safety of their co-workers; to observe all safety rules; and to constantly promote safety through both work and actions.\u00a0 All employees and visitors are empowered with STOP WORK AUTHORITY.\u00a0 If you observe unsafe activity, it is your responsibility to speak up.\u00a0 You have the authority to stop work until it is safe, and there will be no repercussions to you.Raymond notified E. Buchholz and E. Buchholz immediately ordered that loading, hauling, and dumping activities in the area be stopped so he could ensure everyone on Crew 3 was aware they were not to dump over the berm.E. Buchholz then used the radio to address miners in Crew 3 working in the area.\u00a0 He stated to them that the procedure was to dump short and push loads over the highwall when the angle of repose had not been established.\u00a0 Each member of the crew confirmed verbally that they understood.E. Buchholz had a separate discussion with Charette and told him that the crews should be dumping short and pushing over in the area at issue.\u00a0 He also told Charette that the overburden should not be dumped in one location, but from different locations along the highwall.\u00a0 This way a bulldozer operator could keep up with pushing overburden over the highwall.During the night shift on May 4, 2017, E. Buchholz traveled to the berm area and took a photograph of the tire tracks (see Appendix C). \u00a0His intention was to show the photo to Richard Sheridan, the supervisor of the previous shift (Thursday day shift), so that Sheridan could discuss it with his crew.\u00a0 However, E. Buchholz told investigators he did not have a chance to show the photograph to anyone prior to the accident.Investigators were not able to determine if, prior to the accident, trucks impacted the berm at the location where the victim\u2019s truck went over the highwall.\u00a0 However, it was clear that the company\u2019s dump short and 25 foot policies were not followed at either location.Weather ConditionsThe weather was not a factor in the accident. The haul roads were dry. \u00a0Normal temperatures were present without precipitation and visibility was clear.ExaminationsInvestigators reviewed the on-shift examination records and questioned examiners.\u00a0 Mine examiners reported they did not find any hazards related to the highwall, dump location, or the truck on the day of the accident.Caterpillar 777F Haul TruckOn May 12, 2017, the mine completed the access road to the haul truck. \u00a0On that day, MSHA investigators took photographs and performed a preliminary inspection in and around the truck; they found no obvious defects.The vehicle involved in the accident was equipped with the Vital Information Monitoring System (VIMS).\u00a0 VIMS uses numerous sensors to provide information on vital machine functions and alert the driver of an impending or abnormal condition.\u00a0 On May 18, 2017, VIMS data for the truck was downloaded by Steve Clark, Field Technical Representative, for Tractor & Equipment Company (T&E), of Billings, Montana.\u00a0 Investigators were present and all events and payload data from March 1, 2017 through May 6, 2017, were shared with MSHA.\u00a0 Investigators determined the VIMS data did not contain any information related to the accident.On May 31, 2017, Guy Barbera, P.E. Senior Engineer, Jacobson Forensic Engineering, Inc. of Littleton, Colorado, performed four brake tests: park brake test, park brake release, rear service brake, and front service brake on the Caterpillar 777F truck 982. \u00a0Barbera checked the accumulators, which store energy that the brake system will use when there is a loss of power to the brake system.\u00a0 He also checked the thickness of the brake pads. \u00a0All tests and measurements were found to be within the parameters specified by Caterpillar.The truck also had an engine control module (ECM), integrated braking control (IBC), and transmission/chassis control systems (TCC).\u00a0 These systems control operation of the truck, monitor operation, and provide diagnostic warnings to the driver.\u00a0 These systems also store diagnostic and event codes for abnormal conditions and abnormal operation.\u00a0 Barbera downloaded the diagnostic and event code information from these systems. \u00a0These systems indicated there were no abnormal conditions or operation before the accident.\u00a0 No information was recorded on these systems during and after the accident.\u00a0 Investigators found the haul truck had no safety defects that could have contributed to the accident.Training and ExperienceRamsey had 10 years and 18 weeks experience at this mine as a haul truck operator.\u00a0 Ramsey received task training on the Caterpillar 777 end dump trucks on January 3, 2016.\u00a0 During the task training, Jennifer Leigh, Truck Driver, demonstrated and explained proper dumping techniques, including the use of the dump lever control.\u00a0 LeiLeigh also observed Ramsey operate the truck, including dumping.\u00a0 Ramsey completed annual refresher training on April 7, 2017.Kathy Cattles, Training Specialist, examined all of Ramsey\u2019s training records and found that his training was in accordance with 30 CFR \u00a7 Part 48.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "MSHA conducted an analysis to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \u00a0Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the investigation and the operator\u2019s implemented corrective actions to prevent a reoccurrence of this type of accident.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not ensure that trucks dumped a safe distance from the highwall. \u00a0Also, the operator had knowledge that unsafe dump practices were a practice at the mine.\u00a0 The truck fell because it was too close to the highwall and the ground at the dumping place did not support its weight.Corrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator submitted a revised ground control plan, which specifically states: \u201cBerms will not be used as a stop under any circumstances.\u00a0 Trucks will not dump over the highwall under any circumstances.\u00a0 Trucks will dump short and material will be pushed over by bulldozers in any situation where the angle of repose has not been established.\u00a0 The minimum distance for trucks to dump in this situation will be 25 feet from the vertical un-shot edge above any highwall.\u00a0 At no time shall any trucks move or work parallel within 25 feet of the highwall edge.\u201d\u00a0 All truck drivers and bulldozer operators have been trained in the revised ground control plant.\u00a0 To ensure that the ground control plan is being followed, the mine operator has placed a bulldozer at the dump site.\u00a0 The bulldozer operator communicates with the truck drivers to tell them where to dump.\u00a0 In addition, stakes have been installed 25 feet from the highwall so that truck drivers can see where to stop their trucks.", "CONCLUSION": "On May 6, 2017, at approximately 4:45 p.m., Michael Ramsey received fatal injuries when the Caterpillar 777F haul truck he was operating went over a highwall.\u00a0 The victim was backing up his haul truck to dump his load of overburden when the ground under the truck failed, and the haul truck with the victim inside fell backwards to the bottom of the pit containing dumped overburden.\u00a0 The truck traveled approximately 150 feet before coming to a stop.\u00a0The accident occurred because the mine operator did not ensure that haul trucks dumped their loads a safe distance from the highwall.\u00a0 Also, the mine operator had knowledge that unsafe dumping was a practice at the mine.\u00a0Approved By:\u00a0______________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 _____________Richard A.

Ltd (ZMJ), arrived at the mine\u2019s North Portal to prepare for their first day underground. \u00a0Oak Grove is the first mine in the United States to purchase longwall shields from the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u00a0 Around 7:00 a.m., Qian and Liang joined the mine\u2019s longwall set-up crew and entered the mine using the service hoist.\u00a0 At approximately 7:15 a.m., the crew boarded a rail mounted mantrip and traveled to the 17 East Longwall Panel.William Bonner, Longwall Foreman, held a safety meeting with the longwall set-up crew.\u00a0 Donnie Tisdale, General Inside Laborer, and Brandon Wright, Longwall Mechanic, were assigned to work with Qian and Liang.\u00a0 While Tisdale and Wright gathered hand tools, Qian and Liang walked to the set-up face with Jack Rexrode, Maintenance Foreman.\u00a0 Rexrode asked Qian to inspect the hydraulic components on longwall shields 186 through 172 that had been previously installed by Oak Grove employees.Tisdale and Wright arrived at the tailgate side of the set-up face and met with Qian and Liang.\u00a0 The four men then walked to the headgate side of the set-up face and loaded hydraulic components on a battery-powered longwall shield hauler.\u00a0 Rexrode left to check on miners working at another location.\u00a0 Qian and Liang returned to the tailgate side of the set-up face. \u00a0Tisdale and Wright took the longwall shield hauler around the back entry to the tailgate side of the set up face. \u00a0The four men unloaded the hydraulic components and placed them by the shields where they would be installed.\u00a0 Tisdale and Wright took the shield hauler back to the headgate. \u00a0Qian and Liang walked to shield 171 (serial number 075) to begin installing hydraulic components.Qian crawled behind the two support leg cylinders of shield 171 to install low flow yield valves on the tilt cylinder.\u00a0 While Qian was located in the pinch point, behind the support cylinders, he instructed Liang to remove the \u215c inch pipe plug from the tailgate side support cylinder, in preparation for the installation of a pressure gauge.\u00a0 This action depressurized the tailgate side support leg cylinder and placed all of the weight of the shield canopy on the headgate side support leg cylinder.\u00a0Qian, still working on the tilt cylinder, instructed Liang to remove a \u00bd inch pipe plug without specifying from which support cylinder.\u00a0 Liang removed the \u00bd inch plug from the headgate side support leg cylinder, which depressurized the cylinder, causing the shield to collapse.\u00a0Liang immediately called for help. \u00a0Wayne Ingle, Longwall Electrician, and Grady Robinson, Longwall Shearer Operator, were working approximately 75 feet away and heard Liang.\u00a0 They could see that shield 171 had collapsed behind Liang. \u00a0Ingle, Wright, and Tisdale ran toward the tailgate while Robinson ran to the headgate to get the hydraulic pump started to pressurize the shield.Ingle attempted to communicate with the victim when he arrived at shield 171, but there was no response.Robinson notified Rexrode and the rest of the crew that a shield had collapsed. \u00a0He started the hydraulic pump which sent hydraulic fluid to the shield line.\u00a0 Bonner notified persons on the surface of the accident and Rexrode and Bonner went to the accident scene.Upon arrival at the scene, Rexrode manually activated the valve control, in an attempt to raise the collapsed shield.\u00a0 Oil flowed freely from the unplugged port on the tailgate support cylinder, preventing activation of the cylinder.\u00a0 Rexrode plugged this open port and again attempted to raise the shield. \u00a0This attempt also failed, as oil also flowed freely from the open port on the headgate side support cylinder.\u00a0 Rexrode then plugged the headgate side cylinder and the shield was successfully raised.\u00a0 Two wooden crib blocks were placed on the pan line to securely block the shield in position.Matt Miller, Longwall Stage Loader Operator and Mine Rescue/First Aid Team Member, arrived at the scene.\u00a0 Miller checked the victim\u2019s vital signs and found none. \u00a0The victim was placed on a stretcher and transported to the surface area of the mine.Phillip Russell, Jefferson County Deputy Coroner, arrived at the mine site and pronounced the victim dead at 12:02 p.m. \u00a0An autopsy was performed by the Jefferson County Coroner/Medical Examiner Office. \u00a0The cause of death was listed as mechanical asphyxia.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "Ronald Caudill, MSHA Health Specialist, was at the mine performing inspection work.\u00a0 At approximately 11:00 a.m., Benny Long, Oak Grove Mine Employee, notified Caudill that an accident had occurred.\u00a0 Caudillissued a 103(k) order to Michael Richardson, Safety Supervisor, to ensure the safety of all persons and to prevent the destruction of evidence.\u00a0 Caudill traveled to the accident scene and conducted a preliminary examination of the area.Caudill informed Danny Crumpton, MSHA Assistant District Manager (Enforcement), of the accident. \u00a0Timothy Stockman, MSHA Coal Mine Inspector; Ed Boylen, MSHA Field Office Supervisor; and Steve Womack, MSHA Assistant District Manager (Technical), were sent to the mine.At 11:05 a.m., James Morris, Safety Manager, notified the Department of Labor National Contact Center of the accident.After the accident investigation team arrived at the mine, they informally interviewed 20 people.\u00a0 After the interviews were completed, Caudill and Stockman traveled underground to the accident scene and began their investigation.On Sunday, December 4, 2016, Ron Medina, MSHA Technical Support Mechanical Division; Leon Ko, MSHA Technical Support Electrical Division; and Richard A. Gates, MSHA District Manager, along with Caudill and Stockman, traveled to the mine to continue the accident investigation.Persons participating in the investigation are listed in Appendix A. \u00a0The report prepared by MSHA Technical Support is in Appendix B.", "DISCUSSION": "EquipmentThe primary purpose of the longwall shields is to provide temporary roof support during longwall mining operations. \u00a0The Oak Grove Mine recently purchased 188 longwall face shields and 8 gate shields from ZMJ. \u00a0Each face shield weighs 28.6 U.S. tons and each gate shield weighs 32 U.S. tons.\u00a0 Each face shield and each gate shield is equipped with two double acting leg cylinders. \u00a0Each cylinder has a working load rating of 595 U.S. tons at 6,110 psi.\u00a0 The canopy of each shield weighs 9.6 U.S. tons and each caving shield weighs 5 U.S. tons.\u00a0 ZMJ was also contracted to provide on-site technical service for 60 days to aid in the installation of the longwall shields.\u00a0 The shields were to be installed on the 17 East Longwall set-up face.The longwall shields were shipped to the Oak Grove Mine in October 2016 without yield valves and pressure gauges.\u00a0 Those devices were to be installed once the shields were in place underground.\u00a0 Each longwall shield is equipped with a pilot-operated check valve.\u00a0 The purpose of the check valve is to allow the support cylinder to yield at a set pressure to prevent damage.Each leg support cylinder is equipped with a valve block containing protected ports and unprotected ports.\u00a0 The protected ports have a pilot check valve. \u00a0This check valve prevents hydraulic oil from leaving the leg support cylinder, which would cause sudden decompression of the leg cylinder, in the event of a component failure such as a broken hydraulic hose. \u00a0The unprotected ports do not have a pilot check valve. \u00a0If they are opened to the atmosphere, hydraulic oil will leave the leg support cylinder, and the leg support cylinder will decompress.\u00a0 During normal operation, a yield valve and a pressure gauge are installed in the unprotected ports.\u00a0 This allows some, but not all, hydraulic oil to escape in the event that the weight on the shield gets near the weight capacity limit, in order to prevent equipment failure of the shield.\u00a0 The port plugs removed by Liang were on unprotected ports.\u00a0 With plugs removed from unprotected ports on each leg support cylinder, the hydraulic system depressurized, causing the shield\u2019s canopy to collapse (see the drawing in Appendix B).\u00a0 MSHA Technical Support determined there were no defects in the design or function of longwall shield 171.\u00a0Accident Site ObservationsThe accident occurred on the 17 East Longwall Panel set-up face.\u00a0 The mine was in the process of installing longwall shields, starting from the tailgate side.\u00a0 The longwall face was 1,000 feet wide, requiring a total of 186 shields.\u00a0 Shields 186 through 95 had been positioned and the canopy (see the drawing in Appendix B) pressurized to allow the valves and gauges to be installed, but not placed against the roof.\u00a0 The plugs, valves, and gauges lock into place by the insertion of a \u201cU\u201d shaped piece of metal that has two \u201clegs,\u201d commonly referred to as a staple.Prior to the accident, the mine personnel had installed yield valves and pressure gauges on shields 186 through 172 without incident. \u00a0Shield 171, involved in the accident, was found in the following configuration:A \u215c inch plug was found with one leg of the staple installed on the tailgate support cylinder.\nA \u00bd inch plug was found missing from the tailgate support cylinder.\nA \u00bd inch plug was found with one leg of the staple installed on the headgate support cylinder.\nThe plugs that were locked with one staple leg were the plugs quickly installed by the first responders to lift the shield off of the victim. \u00a0This is consistent with witness statements.Work Experience and TrainingQian had 13 years of experience as a shield designer and engineer with ZMJ.\u00a0 During an interview, Liang stated he (Liang) was the Sales Manager of the International Department of ZMJ. \u00a0He received a university degree in English and was the only person at the mine who could speak both English and Mandarin.\u00a0 All miners interviewed believed that his primary role was to translate for the victim.\u00a0 The investigation team acquired a copy of Liang\u2019s resume from the ZMJ U.S. distributor and it did not list any experience assembling longwall shields.The victim was the shield designer and technical expert sent by ZMJ to aid the mine in the installation of the new longwall shields, therefore, no 30 CFR \u00a7 Part 48.7 task training was required for him.\u00a0 However, Liang should have been tasked trained in the installation of the new longwall shields.\u00a0 According to Liang, the victim directed him verbally to remove plugs from the support cylinders.MSHA 30 CFR \u00a7 Part 48 requires all new miners to receive at least 40 hours of training prior to being assigned work duties in an underground coal mine.\u00a0 Mine management provided MSHA with MSHA 5000-23 forms showing that the victim and Liang were given 32 hours of new miner training at the Oak Grove mine site from November 28, 2016 through December 1, 2016.\u00a0 This training was provided by Bevill State Community College.\u00a0 The additional eight hours of on-site training required by Part 48, prior to performing work duties, was not completed at the time of the accident on December 2, 2016.\u00a0 Therefore, MSHA issued a noncontributory citation for a violation of 30 CFR \u00a7 Part 48.5.Accident Events AnalysisBased on the interview with Liang and the investigation of the accident scene, the following events occurred. \u00a0Liang was told by Qian to remove a \u215c inch pipe plug from the tailgate side support leg cylinder in preparation for the installation of a pressure gauge. \u00a0When he removed this plug, it depressurized the tailgate side support leg cylinder.\u00a0 The tailgate side support leg cylinder was also found to have a \u00bd inch pipe plug removed where a yield valve was going to be installed. \u00a0Liang was then told by Qian to remove a \u00bd inch plug in preparation for the installation of a yield valve.\u00a0 The \u00bd inch pipe plug on the tailgate side cylinder had already been removed, so Liang removed the \u00bd inch plug from the headgate side support cylinder.\u00a0 This caused the shield\u2019s canopy to collapse. \u00a0Therefore, Liang\u2019s lack of practical knowledge of longwall shields is a root cause of the accident.\u00a0 At least one plug removed from each cylinder will cause the shield to collapse.Work PracticesThe mine operator began placing shields underground and installing yield valves and gauges while the victim and Liang were going through the training class. \u00a0During the investigation, the mine operator produced an email that explained the process that should be followed when installing yield valves and gauges on the longwall shields.\u00a0 The process is as follows:Install tilt yield valves\nInstall support cylinder yield valves\nInstall yield valves on ram and base lift cylinders\nThe mine operator followed these procedures while installing the hydraulic components on shields 186 through 172 without any problem.\u00a0 The ZMJ employees did not follow this procedure or follow standard maintenance practices.\u00a0 If the ZMJ employees had installed the valves and gauges according to the procedure above, there would not have been a plug removed from two cylinders at the same time. \u00a0Each cylinder would have had the valves and gauges installed before moving onto the next cylinder, as outlined by the procedure.The standard maintenance practice is only one support cylinder should be depressurized at a time when performing maintenance or installing hydraulic components. \u00a0Additionally, no one is allowed past the support cylinders while maintenance is performed on either cylinder.\u00a0 In extreme cases, should it be necessary to depressurize both support cylinders at the same time, the shield canopy would be blocked against motion, for example, with a four-point crib or a set of timbers. \u00a0These standard practices were not followed during installation of hydraulic components on longwall shield 171.\u00a0", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "An analysis was conducted to identify the basic causes of the accident, which could have been corrected through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 Root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have prevented the accident.Root Cause:\u00a0 The contractor did not have an effective procedure to ensure persons working on longwall shields were properly task trained.\u00a0 The contractor used the sales manager/translator as a maintenance assistant, but the translator was not trained in the task of installing the longwall shield.\u00a0 He did not have practical knowledge of safe work procedures for the task and did not recognize the hazard created by depressurizing both support cylinders at the same time.\nCorrective Action: \u00a0The contractor will ensure that all its personnel performing work in the mine are properly trained.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator and contractor did not have an effective procedure to ensure the longwall shield was blocked against motion at all times while work was performed in an area where the shield could collapse onto a miner.\u00a0 Both of the support cylinders of the shield were depressurized while the victim was in the pinch point performing maintenance on the tilt cylinder.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator submitted a revision to the roof control plan that requires a 4-point wood crib to be installed to block the shield against motion while work of this type is performed.\u00a0 MSHA approved this plan revision.\u00a0 The operator and the contractor have retrained all longwall installation personnel on the proper procedure to block the longwall shield canopy when repair, maintenance, or installation of the longwall shield would cause both support cylinders to depressurize.", "CONCLUSION": "An engineer

The truck traveled approximately 64 feet along the top of the berm before rolling over the highwall.INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENTSafety and Health Manager, Bill Owens, notified MSHA of the accident at 2:01 p.m. on September 8, 2016, by a telephone call to the Department of Labor's National Contact Center (DOLNCC).\u00a0 The DOLNCC contacted the MSHA Southeast District Office and an investigation was started the same day.\u00a0 In order to facilitate a rescue effort, an order pursuant to Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977, was verbally issued to the mine operator.\u00a0 This order was subsequently modified to a Section 103(k) order to ensure the safety of miners.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MSHA's accident investigation team conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, reviewed training documentation, and examined work procedures relevant to the accident.\u00a0 MSHA Technical Support participated in the investigation to determine whether equipment defects or factors contributed to the accident.DISCUSSIONWeather\nThe weather at the time of the accident was clear with a temperature of 91 degrees Fahrenheit and light winds.\u00a0 Weather was not considered to be a factor in the accident.\u00a0Training and Experience\nThe victim had over twenty-three years of mining experience with over two years at this operation.\u00a0 MSHA conducted an in-depth review of the victim's training records and determined that there were no contributory training deficiencies.General Truck Information\nThe truck involved in the accident was a Caterpillar Model 773E, rigid frame, off-road, 50-ton dump truck manufactured in 2006 and delivered in 2007.\u00a0 The digital hour meter would not power on after the accident, but according to the Technical Support report, the truck had over 20,000 hours of operation.\u00a0 The truck had a total gross weight rating of approximately 185,000 pounds with a 100,000-pound payload.The truck was powered by a Caterpillar Model 3412, 650 horsepower, 12-cylinder, turbocharged and aftercooled diesel engine.\u00a0 The transmission had seven forward speeds, neutral, and one reverse speed.Brakes\nDamage sustained during the accident made it impossible to perform a complete functional brake system test and air pressure could not be supplied remotely to test the brakes.\u00a0 Technical Support inspected the brake system components and did not find any defects that would have contributed to the accident.Seat Belt\nThe truck was equipped with a 3-point seat belt.\u00a0 Dried dirt on the seat belt latch plate indicated that the seat belt had not been used recently.\u00a0 The seat belt latched properly when tested.\u00a0 The accident investigation team determined that the victim was ejected from the truck because he was not using the seat belt.Additionally, there were rags tied to the seat belt to prevent full retraction of the belt.\u00a0 According to interviews and discussions held as part of the accident investigation, mine personnel used these rags for comfort by sliding them along the belt to keep the belt from constantly tightening.\u00a0 Other mine vehicle seat belts were also equipped with these rags.ROOT CAUSE ANALYSISA root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified:Root Cause:\u00a0The mine operator failed to ensure the victim maintained control of the equipment while in motion\nCorrective Action:\u00a0The mine operator trained all employees regarding the dangers associated with operating equipment when tired, sleepy, and feeling ill.\u00a0 Employees were made aware that they are able to take breaks when they are not feeling alert and are to notify management in such cases.Root Cause:\u00a0The mine operator failed to ensure seat belts were being used properly.\nCorrective Action:\u00a0The mine operator removed all rag modifications and trained all employees in using seat belts properly and in seat belt inspection and maintenance.CONCLUSIONAfter working without incident throughout the morning of September 8, the haul truck Richard Smith was operating, veered off the road, traveled over the berm and fell approximately 201 feet over the highwall.\u00a0 Based on the findings of MSHA's investigation, there was no evidence of mechanical or equipment malfunction or defect. The victim failed to maintain control of the haul truck and failed to wear his seat belt.\u00a0ENFORCEMENT ACTIONSOrder No. 8905873\u00a0\u2013 issued September 8, 2016, pursuant to Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 (originally issued verbally and reduced to writing upon arrival of an inspector and subsequently modified to an order pursuant to Section 103(k)):An accident occurred at this operation on September 8, 2016, at approximately 1350 hours. As rescue and recovery work is necessary, this order is being issued, under Section 103(J) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, to assure the safety of all persons at this operation. This order is also being issued to prevent the destruction of any evidence which would assist in investigating the cause or causes of the accident. It prohibits all activity in the pit area from the top pit ramp to the bottom of bench #8 except to the extent necessary to rescue an individual or prevent or eliminate an imminent danger until MSHA has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in this area. This order applies to all person engaged in the rescue and recovery operation and any other person on-site. \u00a0\u00a0This order was initially issued orally to the mine operator at 1446 hour and is now reduced to writing.Citation No. 8816532\u00a0\u2013 issued November 2, 2016, pursuant to Section 104(a) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 for a violation of 30 CFR \u00a7 56.9101:On September 8, 2016, a fatal accident occurred at this operation when a haul truck operator drifted across the haul road while traveling down a 9% grade.

Lynn (age 59) was killed when rock from a highwall, approximately 80 feet above, fell on the operator's cab of the hydraulic excavator that he was operating.\nThe accident occurred because the operator's mining methods did not maintain wall stability where the victim was working. \u00a0The operator failed to take down or support hazardous ground conditions before work commenced in the area and failed to identify hazardous ground conditions during examinations in the work area prior to work commencing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0GENERAL INFORMATIONThe Vulcan Construction Materials, LLC (Vulcan) Savannah Quarry is a surface limestone mining operation located in Savannah, Hardin County, Tennessee.\u00a0 The Plant Manager is Doug Britt and the Safety and Health Manager is Mike Junkerman.\u00a0 The mine operates five days per week with one shift per day.\u00a0 Shifts range from 10 to 14 hours in length.\u00a0 The mine employs 13 people.\nThere is one active pit at the mine.\u00a0 Vulcan drills and blasts (shoots) the limestone.\u00a0 Excavators and front-end loaders load the resulting material into haul trucks for delivery to on-site processing facilities.\u00a0 The mine produces aggregates, primarily for road construction, and agricultural lime.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on May 5, 2016.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENTOn July 25, 2016, the operator held a 30-minute safety meeting with the miners beginning around 6:00 a.m.\u00a0 Miners traveled to their respective work sites after the meeting.\u00a0 James T. Lynn (victim), a 59-year old miner with over 17 years of experience, traveled to the active working pit area at the north end of the west highwall to operate a track-mounted, Caterpillar 345B excavator to segregate and load rock previously shot from the highwall.\u00a0 At 7:00 a.m., he began loading rock into a Caterpillar 775D, haul truck operated by David Brown.\u00a0The victim was operating the excavator on an elevated pad, or perch, constructed of older shot material near the highwall.\u00a0 During the loading process and while waiting on the haul truck to return, the victim used the excavator to move large rocks out of the way so that smaller rock material could be loaded into the truck to haul to the rip-rap plant.\u00a0 The rip-rap plant was located approximately 400 yards away from where the victim was working.At approximately 8:45 a.m., Brown heard a loud noise as he was hauling a load to the rip-rap plant.\u00a0 He initially thought it was coming from loading rip-rap at the plant but did not see anyone in that direction.\u00a0 Brown was concerned something had happened and tried to contact Lynn via CB radio.\u00a0 Receiving no response, Brown traveled back to the excavator and saw large rocks on top of it and could not see the operator's cab.\u00a0 The excavator was still running and hydraulic fluid was pouring out.\u00a0 The cab side of the excavator was closest to the highwall with the rear of the excavator facing away from the highwall.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Ronnie Cagle, Heavy Equipment Operator, was using a front-end loader to load the hopper at the rip-rap plant and overheard Brown trying to contact the victim on the radio.\u00a0 Brown thought the rock could be moved off the excavator with the front-end loader and asked Cagle to come quickly with it.\u00a0 Cagle drove the front-end loader to the accident site and saw the rock on the excavator cab.\u00a0 He realized there was no way to get to the victim and that the potential for additional rock movement presented a danger.\u00a0\u00a0Doug Britt was at the mine and overheard Brown calling to the victim over the radio.\u00a0 Brown asked Britt to call 911.\u00a0 Britt contacted emergency services at 8:48 a.m. and traveled to the accident site.\u00a0 Emergency services started arriving at 9:00 a.m including Hardin County EMS, Hardin County Fire and Rescue, and the Hardin County Sheriff's Office.\u00a0 An emergency response helicopter was also dispatched to the mine.Due to the condition of the cab and the location of the excavator in relation to the highwall, the mine operator used a Caterpillar D8 bulldozer to pull the excavator to a safe location to extricate the victim.\u00a0 The operator used vise grips to clamp the fuel line to stop fuel flow and turn off the machine.\u00a0 An EMT with Hardin County EMS could not feel a pulse and did not receive a response when asking the victim to respond.\u00a0 The EMT report indicates that the victim \"expired on the impact of the boulders landing on the cab.\"\u00a0INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENTMike Junkerman notified MSHA of the accident at 9:03 a.m. CDST on July 25, 2016, by a telephone call to the Department of Labor's National Contact Center (DOLNCC).\u00a0 The DOLNCC contacted David Allen, Safety Specialist, Southeast District. Junkerman was not at the mine when the accident occurred and reported to the DOLNCC that an excavator operator was trapped when rocks fell on top of the excavator.\u00a0 MSHA initially considered this a rescue and recovery operation and verbally issued an order pursuant to Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977, as amended, by phone, prior to the arrival of an inspector.\u00a0 Ed Jewell, Mine Safety and Health Inspector, arrived at the mine and reduced the Section 103(j) order to writing.\u00a0 When he learned it was no longer a rescue and recovery operation, the inspector modified to a Section 103(k) order to ensure the safety of miners until an investigation could be conducted. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MSHA's accident investigation team conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, reviewed training documentation, and examined work procedures relevant to the accident.\u00a0 MSHA Technical Support participated in the investigation to help determine causal factors contributing to the accident and to make measurements using a calibrated, Laser Technology Impulse 200 range finder.\u00a0 The investigation was conducted with the assistance of mine management.\u00a0 There were no eye witnesses to the accident.DISCUSSIONWeather\nThe most recent measurable rainfall prior to the accident was 0.04-inch on July 16, 2016.\u00a0 July 25, 2016 was hot and dry with a high temperature of 100\u00ba F.\u00a0 Adverse weather did not play a part in the accident.Training and Experience\nThe victim had over 17 years of mining experience, 8 of which were at this mine.\u00a0 A representative of MSHA's Educational Field and Small Mine Services staff conducted an in-depth review of the victim's training records. MSHA determined that there were no contributory training deficiencies.Geology\nThe mine produces aggregates from the Dixon, Lego, and Laurel limestone formations of the Wayne group in descending order. The Dixon formation is alternating layers of brown and green calcareous mudstone interbedded with limestone.\u00a0 The Lego formation is composed of green and reddish brown limestone.\u00a0 The Laurel formation is similar to the Lego formation.\u00a0 There is one-foot thick Waldon shale between the Lego and Laurel formations.The formations in the quarry are highly jointed.\u00a0 This creates a rugged highwall face, as shown in APPENDIX B, Photos 1, 2, and 3, and increases the likelihood of rockfalls.\u00a0 The portion of the west wall at the accident site is nearly vertical with strike in the north to south direction.\u00a0 The primary joint set in the accident area runs in the direction of N26\u00b0E.\u00a0 Measurements indicate that the dip of the joint set was 88.6\u00b0, or nearly vertical.\u00a0 One of the joint sets was traced to 48 feet on the top of the highwall and was visible in the north highwall 252 feet away as shown in APPENDIX B, Photo 4.\u00a0 In addition, there were at least four additional joints parallel to the primary joint in an area 24 feet from the highwall face.\u00a0 The spacing between the joints was as close as 13 feet.\u00a0 The joints were visible and appeared tight well behind the highwall face, but were open as the joints got closer to the face.\u00a0 A close-up view of a primary joint set near the highwall face is shown in APPENDIX B, Photo 5.Perch\nThe interviews revealed that the victim sometimes constructed a perch from the top of which he would load and separate materials.\u00a0 The victim was operating the excavator on a perch that was approximately 7 feet high, 27 feet wide and 25 feet long.\u00a0 The accident investigation team estimates that the top of the excavator cab was 19 feet above the pit floor.\u00a0 The excavator was positioned on top of material left from a shot made on June 23, 2016.\u00a0 The victim was loading and separating material shot on July 21, 2016.Highwall and Rockfall\nThe accident investigation team measured the highwall to be approximately 111 feet high from the pit floor to the top of the wall at the accident site.\u00a0 The rockfall appears to have initiated at a height between 96 and 102 feet above the pit floor, approximately 80 feet above the excavator cab, and left a V shape cavity in wall.\u00a0 The excavator was located near the highwall with the rear of the excavator facing away from the wall.\u00a0 This placed the operator's cab directly adjacent to the highwall. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One piece of rock remaining on top of the excavator was examined.\u00a0 This particular rock measured 3 feet high, 4 feet long, and 20 inches thick, and was calculated to weigh approximately 3,300 pounds.\u00a0 The strata in this rock matched the strata at the V-shaped cavity in the highwall.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As shown in Appendix B, Photo 1, an area adjacent to the excavator's location previously failed at some undetermined time.\u00a0 Highwall material slid from a height of approximately 57 feet above the pit floor.\u00a0 Such failures should be cause for further investigation as they are often indicative of instability.Mining Methods\nThe operator uses drilling and blasting to remove material from the highwall.\u00a0 The standard shot-pattern is 19 feet by 21 feet with 6.5-inch holes.\u00a0 Holes are drilled to a depth of 123 feet.\u00a0 The mine does not use pre-splitting blasting methods.\u00a0 Pre-splitting helps control back-break and maintain wall stability by controlling fragmentation.The direction of mining, in relation to the jointing, contributed to highwall instability due to the multiple planes of weakness present in the highwall strata at an acute angle to the face.\u00a0 Blasting practices, in conjunction with the direction of mining relative to the joints, created a broken and blocky highwall susceptible to failures and rockfalls from a near-vertical face.\u00a0The operator did not have equipment with sufficient reach and capability to scale the highwall at the mine.\u00a0 Vulcan used an excavator to scale from the top of the highwall, but it only had the capability of scaling approximately 27 feet from the top, leaving a sizable portion of the highwall face that could not be scaled due to its height.\u00a0Where loose highwall material could not be scaled, the common practice at the mine was to construct barricades using previously shot material to prevent persons from entering the hazardous area.\u00a0 In such cases, active mining would move to another location until the highwall could be shot again at some time in the future to remove the hazardous conditions.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, nearly the entire interior perimeter of the pit was barricaded to prevent exposure to hazardous highwall conditions.\u00a0 The only location where a barricade was not present was at the active working location.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, the excavator was positioned on a perch constructed of material from a previous shot, which would typically be material used to construct a barrier to prevent entry into a hazardous area.\u00a0\u00a0Ground Conditions\nAccident investigators observed broken, loose, and hanging rock and multiple joints on the highwall. \u00a0\u00a0They also observed loose material \"dribble\" off the highwall in areas near the accident site on at least two occasions while investigators were present.\u00a0 These conditions were present throughout the pit. \u00a0The operator had not taken down or supported the loose ground before work commenced in the area.\u00a0 The active working area was not posted with a warning against entry and there was no barrier to impede entry to the area.Examinations\u00a0\u00a0\nUnder Vulcan policy, each miner was designated to conduct examinations of their respective work areas.\u00a0 This included examinations of ground conditions where work was to be performed prior to work commencing.\u00a0 Miners made records of their examinations daily.\u00a0 There were no records indicating hazardous highwall conditions prior to the accident.\u00a0 The examination of ground conditions at the accident site area for July 25, 2016, either had not been recorded or could not be located following the accident.\u00a0The broken, loose, and hanging rock and multiple joints were obvious from the pit floor.\u00a0 The extent of these conditions was even more obvious when viewed from the top of the highwall.\u00a0 The joints were clearly visible and displayed signs of separation as they neared the edge of the highwall.\u00a0 Due to curvature in the highwall, the broken, loose, and hanging rock materials were clearly visible when viewing the active highwall area from the side as shown in Appendix B, Photo 3.\u00a0 Examinations from the top of the highwall (as shown in Appendix B, Photo 4 & 5) were not a routine part of the miners' examinations of ground conditions before work commenced below.\u00a0 Prudent examinations of highwall ground conditions include observations from multiple vantage points to ensure hazardous conditions are identified and corrected before miners are exposed to them.\u00a0ROOT CAUSE ANALYSISA root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified:Root Cause:\u00a0The operator's mining methods did not maintain wall stability in places where persons work or travel.\n\u00a0Corrective Action:\u00a0The operator has revised their mining methods to alter the mining direction with respect to jointing and has revised the shot pattern to reduce back-break.\u00a0\u00a0Root Cause: The operator failed to take down or support hazardous ground conditions before work commenced in the area.\n\u00a0Corrective Action: The operator has instituted and trained all employees in a plan for taking down hazardous ground conditions with equipment that can reach all areas of the highwall face.Root Cause: The operator failed to conduct an adequate workplace examination. The operator failed to identify hazardous ground conditions in the work area prior to work commencing.\n\u00a0Corrective Action: The mine has instituted written highwall inspection procedures which include conducting examinations from the top of the highwall before work commences.\u00a0 All miners have been trained in these inspection procedures.\u00a0CONCLUSIONThe accident occurred because Vulcan's mining methods did not maintain wall stability where the victim was working.\u00a0 The operator failed to take down or support hazardous ground conditions before work commenced in the area, and failed to identify hazardous ground conditions during workplace examinations prior to work commencing.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ENFORCEMENT ACTIONSOrder No. 8818895\u00a0\u2013 issued July 25, 2016, pursuant to Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 (originally issued verbally and reduced to writing upon arrival of an inspector and subsequently modified to an order pursuant to Section 103(k)):An accident occurred at this operation on 07/25/2016 at approximately 0845.\u00a0 As rescue and recovery work is necessary, this order is being issued under Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 to assure the safety of all persons at the operation.\u00a0 This order is also being issued to prevent the destruction of any evidence which would assist in investigating the cause or causes of the accident.\u00a0 It prohibits all activity at the mine's pit area until MSHA has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in this area.\u00a0 This order applies to all persons engaged in the rescue and recovery operation and any other persons on-site.\u00a0 This order was initially issued orally to the mine operator at 0940 and has now been reduced to writing.Subsequent Action No. 8818895-01\u00a0\u2013 issued July 25, 2016, to modify the original 103(j) order to an order pursuant to Section 103(k) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977Citation No. 8904016\u00a0\u2013 issued August 11, 2016, pursuant to Section 104(d)(1) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 for a violation of 30 CFR \u00a7 56.3130:Failure to maintain wall stability contributed to a fatal accident that occurred at this mine on 25 July, 2016, when the cab of a track-mounted excavator was crushed by a fall of material from the quarry highwall.\u00a0 The excavator was being used to sort and selectively load blasted rock into a haul truck, and was working from an elevated position constructed from the remnants of a previous shot adjacent to the quarry wall.The quarry face intersects strong Geologic jointing at an acute angle.\u00a0 The jointing is pervasive vertically and extensive laterally.\u00a0 This condition contributes to a highly-fractured quarry wall by creating multiple planes of weakness in the rock strata.\u00a0 This resulted in obvious and extensive broken, loose and hanging rock on the wall.\u00a0 The operator did not employ benching, nor did the operator provide any equipment on-site with sufficient reach and capability to scale the quarry wall (the highwall is 111ft high, excavator has 40ft max horizontal, 27ft vertical downward, and 35ft vertical upward reaches).\u00a0 There were no signs or barricades in place to prevent the excavator from entering an area where hazardous conditions existed.Management engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence by failing to use mining methods that maintain wall stability.\u00a0 This violation is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory health and safety standard.Order No. 8904017\u00a0\u2013 issued August 11, 2016, pursuant to Section 104(d)(1) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health

excavator was being used to sort and selectively load blasted rock into a haul truck, and was working from an elevated position constructed from remnants of a previous shot adjacent to the quarry wall.\u00a0 When the excavator was repositioned along the quarry wall in the course of the operator's tasks, it was struck by material falling from the highly-fractured quarry face.\u00a0Management engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence by failing to take down or support loose ground and post warnings or barricade the area against entry.\u00a0 This violation is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory health and safety standard.Order No. 8904018\u00a0\u2013 issued August 11, 2016, pursuant to Section 104(d)(1) of the Federal Mine Safety & Health Act of 1977 for a violation of 30 CFR \u00a7 56.3401:Failure to conduct an adequate examination utilizing multiple vantage points of the quarry wall contributed to a fatal accident that occurred at this mine on 25 July, 2016.\u00a0 The cab of a track-mounted excavator was crushed by a fall of material from the quarry highwall.\u00a0 The excavator was being used to sort and selectively load blasted rock into a haul truck, and was working from an elevated position constructed from the remnants of a previous shot adjacent to the quarry wall.\u00a0 An examination of the quarry wall was not adequately conducted to identify hazardous ground conditions prior to the excavator being placed near the highly-fractured quarry wall where broken, loose and hanging rock was obvious and extensive.Management engaged in aggravated conduct constituting more than ordinary negligence by failing to ensure exams are adequately conducted to identify hazardous loose ground conditions.\u00a0

(Green Brothers), located in Crystal Springs, Copiah County, Mississippi. The principal operating official is Heyward Green, Owner/Vice President. The mine employs approximately twenty one people and operates a twelve-hour shift, five days per week.Material is mined using a single bench method. The operator mines sand and gravel by using an excavator to extract the material and load haul trucks. The material is hauled to the plant on the mine property where it is processed and sold for construction sand and aggregate.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on November 18, 2015.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On June 3, 2016, Hemphill and Shorter arrived at the mine around 6:00 a.m. Hemphill was the shift supervisor the day of the accident. He discussed the day's work schedule with the dirt crew and made work assignments. Hemphill assigned Raymond White, Excavator Operator, and Willie Owens, Haul Truck Driver, to excavate and haul waste from the Sojourner Pit, located on the southeast side of the mine property. \u00a0Hemphill assigned himself, Shorter and Shontavius Norals, Haul Truck Driver, to work in the Johnson Pit, located at the northeast corner of the mine. \u00a0Hemphill loaded Norals's and Shorter's trucks and they transported the material to the plant or waste dump, as determined load-by-load.At approximately 11:25 a.m., Hemphill was loading Shorter about 50 feet west of the Johnson Pit wall. Norals was parked to the west of the loading operation waiting to be loaded. Norals observed the east wall of the Johnson Pit begin to break and slurry and tailings (waste sand and clay) material breach the wall. \u00a0He shifted his truck into reverse and backed up the bank on the west side of the pit, before shifting into a forward gear to exit the pit, as the material engulfed the excavator and haul truck that Hemphill and Shorter were operating. \u00a0Norals stated that the entire incident occurred in a matter of seconds.Norals contacted Jackie Mullins, Superintendent, and informed him of the failure. Mullins contacted Ann Moore, Office Manager, who called 911. Copiah County Emergency Management, Sheriff's Deputies, and Fire and Rescue arrived on scene at 11:35 a.m. Rescue workers were unable to gain access to the area where the excavator and haul truck were buried in the liquefied slurry.Norman Ford, Green Brothers Assistant Vice President, notified MSHA of the accident at 11:52 a.m. Central Time, by telephone call to the Department of Labor's National Contact Center (DOLNCC).

The crane then began the process of rigging and lifting the equipment.\u00a0 Crane crews worked through the day to attempt to remove the equipment.On June 5, rescue workers determined there was too much material in the pit and efforts to pull the buried equipment with the crane stopped.\u00a0 The operator decided to pump the material from the pit.\u00a0 The plan would use onsite pumps, hoses, and pipes in an attempt to pump mud from the flooded pit to another impoundment onsite away from the accident location. Later that same day, the operator decided to not utilize the pumping equipment onsite and decided to bring in other pumps and equipment and personnel to perform the work.\u00a0On June 6, additional pumps and crews arrived and began running the pumps.\u00a0 Pumping uncovered a fair portion of the equipment and on June 7, a long reach excavator arrived onsite and was used in combination with the pumping to uncover the top of the cab of the haul truck. Upon reaching the cab, search and rescue teams assisted in the search and possibly recovery of the victims.\u00a0 The search and rescue teams were able to cut and remove the top of the haul unit cab. Teams began digging by hand to make entry into the cab and search for Mr. Shorter. The entire cab was cleared but they were unable to locate Shorter.\u00a0On June 8, rescue workers continued using the pumps to lower the material and locate the other known miner's location, the cab of the excavator. Rescue workers located the cab of the excavator around 3:00 p.m. and at approximately 10:00 p.m. that evening Mr. Hemphill was located in the cab of the excavator.\u00a0 On June 9, Mr. Hemphill's body was recovered at 6:56 a.m.Pumping continued on June 9 and 10 to remove more material from around the machines in an attempt to locate Mr. Shorter.\u00a0 Rescue crews used ground penetrating radar and cadaver dogs on June 10 to locate Mr. Shorter. The use of radar was unsuccessful given the material that had flooded the pit location.\u00a0 Crews continued to wash and pump material in the area of the truck and were able to locate Mr. Shorter at approximately 10:00 p.m. on June 10.\u00a0 At approximately 1:30 a.m. on June 11, MSHA, the state search and rescue team and county officials developed a recovery plan and at approximately 7:00 a.m., workers were able to recover Mr. Shorter and remove him from the pit.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On June 20, 2016, MSHA's accident investigation team traveled to the mine to conduct a physical inspection of the accident scene, interview employees, and review documents and work procedures relevant to the accident.

(Jerico) was the blasting contractor at the site and was responsible for handling, loading and detonating explosives.At the time of the accident, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) was conducting a regular mandated safety inspection of the mine.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On March 21, 2016, the day before the accident, Wendling began drilling a blast hole pattern previously laid out by Martin Marietta employees, Tracy Hockemeier and David Norman, Assistant Plant Manager. \u00a0Wendling completed the drilling on the day of the accident, March 22nd. \u00a0Due to water levels at the mine, Martin Marietta ran a de-watering pump to a nearby pond each day as drilling was performed.On the day of the accident, Hockemeier reported to work at approximately 6:30 a.m., his normal starting time. Hockemeier met with Norman to discuss the day\u2019s events and then proceeded to the shop to supervise a crew doing plant maintenance work.\u00a0 Around 12:25 p.m., Norman received a call from Danielle Fiorini, Scale Clerk, asking him to come to the scale house. \u00a0Upon arrival, he discovered Christopher Willett, MSHA Inspector, had arrived to conduct a regular safety inspection of the mine. \u00a0Norman accompanied Willett on his inspection.At approximately 1:05 p.m., Jerico arrived at the mine to load the drill holes. \u00a0Hockemeier met with Jerico employees Brent Edgington, Lead Blaster, and Logan Edgington and Jarod Nehring, Blaster\u2019s Helpers.\u00a0 After their on-site mine training, the Jerico employees proceeded to the Winterset section of the quarry to view the blast layout. \u00a0When attempting to access the blast site, B. Edgington discovered access was impassable for the explosives trucks due to muddy conditions.At approximately 2:00 p.m., Hockemeier coordinated efforts to improve access for the explosives trucks. \u00a0During this time, he discussed the general layout of the shot with B. Edgington. \u00a0B. Edgington stated during the interview process, that when they entered the drilled out blast site, he recognized that there were unloadable holes. That due to water there would be muddy or collapsed holes.\u00a0\nAt approximately 2:30 p.m., B. Edgington spoke in person with Ross Breeden, a Driller for Wendling, because he had not received a driller\u2019s log reflecting the holes drilled for the blasting pattern. \u00a0Breeden told Edgington that there was hydraulic pressure in the blasting pattern and quite a bit of water was coming out of holes as he drilled out the blasting pattern. \u00a0At approximately 4:00 p.m., the access road into the area improved, and the Jerico employees began loading the drill holes. \u00a0As they loaded the pattern, Willett and Norman arrived at the blast site as part of the regular inspection. \u00a0Willett reviewed the blasters\u2019 training records, inspected truck #049 and observed the loading cycle. \u00a0He left with Norman to continue his inspection and the blasters continued loading holes. \u00a0L. Edgington left the mine for the remainder of the day as loading continued.At approximately 6:00 p.m., Willett returned to the Winterset section when he saw the blasters starting to wire the holes for the upcoming blast. \u00a0He advised Norman that he wanted to observe the blast. \u00a0Willett, Norman and Hockemeier left the pit area so the blasters could tie the blast lines to the lead line. \u00a0Norman and Willett drove up the haul road, approximately 2,400 feet north of the blast site. \u00a0At this time, Todd Cook, leadman of the onsite stripping crew, contacted Norman and advised him that everyone had left the mine site, including the driller, and that he was locking the gate at the mine entrance. \u00a0Norman relayed Cook\u2019s comments to Hockemeier. \u00a0Hockemeier sounded the blasting warning siren as he drove thru the quarry. \u00a0Hockemeier initially headed west from the blast site, passing Nehring.\u00a0 He turned north heading up the haul road and stopped approximately 1200 feet from the blast site, roughly midway between the shot and Norman and Willett\u2019s location.\u00a0 Nehring was positioned in the blast shelter, approximately 396 feet from the blast, where he would initiate the blast.\u00a0 He could not see Hockemeier, Norman or Willett from his location.\u00a0 B. Edgington was positioned behind the bulk explosives truck, approximately 323 feet further west from Nehring\u2019s position (719 feet from the blast).At approximately 6:30 p.m., using a handheld radio, Hockemeier called Nehring to tell him it was clear to shoot. \u00a0Nehring responded with a verbal radio confirmation back to Hockemeier and then detonated the blast. \u00a0Willett and Norman were unable to hear the communications between Hockemeier and Nehring (the handheld radio communications were exclusively between Hockemeier and Nehring), but saw the blast from their position. \u00a0After the shot, Nehring checked the blast area from his location and gave an all clear radio communication via the handheld radio but did not receive a response from Hockemeier. \u00a0Nehring radioed again that the shot was clear. At this time, B. Edgington moved to Nehring\u2019s location and began retrieving items from the shot.Willett and Norman waited approximately 10 minutes for someone to give the all clear.\u00a0 They could see Hockemeier\u2019s truck parked and could still hear the blasting warning siren.\u00a0 Norman and Willett proceeded to Hockemeier\u2019s truck and discovered him slumped over in the cab. \u00a0A rock had penetrated the roof of the truck cab, striking him in the head. \u00a0Discovering no vital signs, Norman called 911 at approximately 6:39 p.m. Willett proceeded to the blasters\u2019 location to inform them of the accident and instructed them to remain in the pit area.Emergency medical services arrived and confirmed that Hockemeier had no vital signs. \u00a0The Madison County medical examiner arrived and pronounced Hockemeier dead at the scene. \u00a0The death was attributed to a blunt force injury to the head.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "David Norman, Assistant Plant Manager, notified MSHA of the accident at 6:55 p.m. on March 22, 2016, by a telephone call to the Department of Labor\u2019s National Contact Center (DOLNCC).\u00a0 The DOLNCC contacted David Schwab, Acting Supervisory Special Investigator for the North Central District, and an investigation began the same day. \u00a0In order to ensure the safety of all persons, MSHA issued a 103(k) order under the Mine Act.MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team traveled to the mine site, conducted a physical examination of the accident scene, reviewed documents, and interviewed employees, equipment and company procedures relative to the accident. \u00a0MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, mine employees, drilling contractors, Wendling Quarries, Inc., and blasting contractors, Jerico Services, Inc."}}, "/data-reports/fatality-reports/2016/fatality-2-march-08-2016": {"report-url": "https://www.msha.gov/data-reports/fatality-reports/2016/fatality-2-march-08-2016", "accidnet-classification": "Powered Haulage", "location": "Beck Street South, Utah", "mine-type": "Metal and Non-Metal", "mine-controller": "CRH PLC", "mined-mineral": "Construction Sand and Gravel", "incident-date": "2016-03-08T11:06:00-05:00", "public-notice": "This posting serves to provide a public notice to employees of the mine, employees of the mining company(s), employees of independent contractors with any connection to the mine, persons with any connection to the mine, and any person with information regarding the cause or contributing factors of this accident.\nPlease provide any information to:\nJoseph Summers, Lead Accident InvestigatorPhone:\u00a0303.231.5465\n", "preliminary-report": "At approximately 22:50, a search began for a haul truck when the truck and driver failed to return for a load.

Management failed to prevent a railcar washer from being exposed to an atmosphere that was below the minimal oxygen content of 18%. Management failed to conduct exposure monitoring to determine the adequacy of control measures. Management failed to have a second miner available with backup equipment and rescue capability in the event of failure of the respiratory equipment. Finally, management failed to have a second person tend a lifeline when a miner was entering a tank.\u00a0", "GENERAL INFORMATION": "Thiele Kaolin Company is a kaolin processing facility located in Sandersville, Washington County, Georgia. Eric Tillirson is President and Greg Frazier is Manager of Safety. The plant operates four twelve hour shifts, seven days a week. There are a total of 314 employees at this facility.Kaolin is initially processed at the mine facilities and then pumped into the plant thru pipelines for further processing. The kaolin material is classified according to particle size and brightness enhanced through chemical and mechanical means and then filtered using rotary vacuum filters to produce the final product. The finished product is then spray dried, made into slurry, or calcined. The finished product is shipped by railroad tank cars, tank trucks, hopper cars, or bags. Thiele contracts CVB Industrial Contracting, Inc. (CVB) to conduct various tasks at the plant, including bagging kaolin and washing railcars.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on June 25, 2015.", "DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On the day of the accident, July 15, 2015, Travis Barnes (victim), contract employee with CVB, reported to work at approximately 6 a.m. his normal starting time. Barnes first reported to the track shed. At 6:05 a.m., Barnes and Tony Butts, both car washers for CVB, left the track shed to start sealing loaded railcars to prepare for shipment. At approximately 6:40 a.m., Barnes went back to the track shed to complete paperwork, wait for the train to pull out the loaded railcars and spot the empty railcars in the wash area of the plant. At 7:30 a.m., the train arrived to pull out the loaded cars but did not have any empty cars to leave. The train did not return with the empty cars until 10 a.m.At that time, the car washers left the track shed to go and wash the empty cars. Jim Dunn, Thiele Track Supervisor, saw Barnes at approximately 11:00 a.m., preparing to move five cars down the track to the washing area. Barnes was seen again on top of the accident car on track #2 by Antonio Watts, Thiele car washer, who had been on the adjacent track #3 washing cars. Watts went to track #6 to talk to Terry Gilmore, Track Leadman with Thiele. When Watts returned to the wash area, he noticed that Barnes had not started to wash the railcar. Watts was concerned that Barnes was inside the railcar longer than usual. Watts then climbed the railcar access ladder to check on Barnes. Watts saw Barnes was inside the railcar unresponsive. Barnes was not equipped with a lifeline and there was not a second person present. Watts called Dunn, who was off site at lunch. Dunn called Ronnie Adams, Production Foreman, and told him to call 911.Emergency services were called at 12:06 p.m. Willie Durden, Thiele employee and volunteer fireman, was working at the plant and received the call on his fire pager at 12:08 p.m. Durden was the first on the scene and immediately entered the railcar. Police and EMS arrived right after Durden. A rope was dropped into the railcar and Durden hooked it to Barnes\u2019 fall protection harness. Barnes was lifted out of the railcar and CPR was immediately started. Barnes was transported by ambulance to Washington County Regional Medical Center where he was pronounced dead by E. K. May, Washington County Coroner. The cause of death was attributed to environmental suffocation.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "Trey Turner, CVB Industrial Contracting EHS Manager, notified MSHA of the accident at 12:23 p.m. July 15, 2015, by calling the Department of Labor\u2019s National Contact Center (DOLNCC). The DOLNCC notified Judith Etterer, Staff Assistant, and an investigation was started the same day. In order to ensure the safety of all persons, MSHA issued a 103(j) order and later modified to section 103(k) of the Mine Act when the first Authorized Representative arrived at the mine. MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team traveled to the mine and conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, conducted air sampling and reviewed training and work procedures relevant to the accident. MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine and contract management and employees.", "PHYSICAL FACTORS": "ACCIDENT DESCRIPTION:On July 15, 2015, a fatality occurred at Theile Kaolin Company\u2019s (Thiele) Main Processing Plant in Sandersville, Georgia. The victim, a 25 year-old male, was found unresponsive inside of an empty rail tank car (GATX 22394) that transported a kaolin slurry product to a Chempak Transload Facility (Chempak) in Pennsylvania. The railcar initially shipped from Thiele on June 1, 2015, was off-loaded at Chempak on July 6, 2015, and arrived back at Thiele on the morning of the accident.The victim was preparing to wash residual slurry product out of Railcar GATX 22394, his first railcar of the day. The victim entered the railcar through the manway and climbed approximately 10 feet down an access ladder. The victim was later found unresponsive at the bottom of the car (Appendix A, Figures A1-A4). As shown in Figures A3 and A4, the victim\u2019s railcar did not contain much residual product upon its return to Thiele.The victim was found wearing a full-face chemical cartridge respirator with organic vapor/acid gas cartridges. A Thiele RKI GX-2009 Portable Gas Monitor and Vertex Standard radio were also found on the victim. A fall protection harness was worn by the victim without a lanyard. Based on interviews, it is believed that the victim was alone in the railcar for at least 45-60 minutes before he was discovered. There was no evidence that the victim started washing the railcar, indicating that he may have been quickly incapacitated following entry. Data files obtained from the victim\u2019s monitor revealed that the monitor was never turned on the day of the accident.A Thiele employee entered the victim\u2019s railcar for approximately 20 minutes to assist in the extrication of the victim via a lifeline. Upon removing the victim from the railcar, a Thiele RKI GX-2009 monitor was placed at the top of the manway. The oxygen concentration at the opening was reported to be approximately 16.7%. During interviews, it was determined that the Thiele employee who assisted with the rescue did not test the air quality inside of the railcar prior to entry.RKI GX-2009 DATA ANALYSIS:Troy Hart, Industrial Hygienist, Physical and Toxic Agents Division, PS&HTC, Denver, CO conducted an analysis of data recovered from five Thiele RKI GX-2009 monitors. Data from the five instruments, along with additional details from the investigators, is provided in Appendix C.PRODUCT DESCRIPTION AND LOADING/UNLOADING PROCESSThiele manufactures various kaolin slurry mixtures that are shipped via railcar to customers. The product transported in the victim\u2019s railcar was Kaogloss Plus, a kaolin slurry product manufactured for the PaperWorks paper mill in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Bulk samples of the slurry transported in the victim\u2019s railcar were obtained from Thiele\u2019s on-site production laboratory. The product did not have a noticeable odor.Kaolin slurry products may be held in railcars up to 30 days prior to being off-loaded; therefore, a low dose biocide (i.e., Thione) is routinely added to prevent bacteria growth. The active dose of Thione in Kaogloss Plus is approximately 70 parts per million. Methyl isothiocyanate (MITC), methylamine, and carbon disulfide are potential decomposition products of Thione. Approximately 7 pounds of xanthan gum is added to each Kaogloss Plus railcar to prevent the kaolin from settling. All slurry additives are well below the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) reporting threshold of 1%. Chemical concentrations above 1% are required to be reported on the SDS.In January 2015, PaperWorks began using Chempak to off-load the kaolin slurry from railcars into tank trucks for delivery to the paper mill in Essington, Pennsylvania. This was due to a weight limit on a railway bridge, which prevented Thiele railcars from shipping at full capacity to the PaperWorks paper mill. During the off-loading process, railcars are pressurized to convey the slurry into tank trucks via transfer lines. According to a Thiele representative, plant air and nitrogen are used at the Chempak facility; however, only compressor-supplied plant air is used during the off-loading of kaolin slurry.Thiele\u2019s railcar wash crew employees are responsible for cleaning empty railcars that have been returned to the facility. The wash crew consists of three CVB contract employees and two Thiele employees. From the statements provided by the wash crew the following work practice was in place: Prior to cleaning a railcar, a relief valve is opened to relieve pressure from the car. A bottom drain plug is opened to drain residual product from the car. A 20 inch diameter railcar manway cover is opened using a wrench. Upon opening the manway, an RKI GX-2009 Portable Gas Monitor is used to check the railcar\u2019s atmosphere. The monitor is equipped with sensors for oxygen (O2), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and combustible gas (LEL). A rubber band is attached to the monitor clip and the monitor is lowered into the car at arm\u2019s length. Following the air quality check, the manway seal and hole are hosed off. The bottom of the car is also hosed to clear a spot for the wash crew employee to stand. An access ladder is placed on the manway hole and the employee climbs into the railcar. Mechanical ventilation is not used during the cleaning process. According to CVB management, washing facilitates the movement of atmospheric air into the railcar.SAMPLING PROCEDURES AND METHODSDuring the investigation, MSHA conducted air monitoring inside of the victim\u2019s railcar and in seven empty and pressurized kaolin slurry railcars that were returned to Thiele. Four of the seven railcars had been off-loaded at Chempak, while the other three railcars were unloaded at customer locations. A summary of monitoring conducted in each railcar is provided at the end of this section in Table 2.Industrial Scientific iBRID\u2122 multi-gas monitors with integral sampling pumps were used to sample the atmosphere inside of each railcar. The iBRIDs were fully calibrated prior to use and were configured to monitor O2, CO, carbon dioxide (CO2), H2S, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). Prior to opening the railcar manway cover, the detectors were placed at the top relief valve to monitor the air relieved from the car. Immediately after the manway was opened, the detectors were placed at arm\u2019s length in the manway opening. Remote monitoring was conducted inside of each railcar via a Tygon sampling line connected to the pump inlet of each iBRID. Monitoring was conducted near the bottom of each railcar and at breathing zone height (BZH) for at least 60 minutes. The average concentration of each gas over a ten second period was recorded on each monitor.If an oxygen deficient atmosphere was detected inside of a railcar, air from the railcar was collected into SKC FlexFoil\u00ae 1 liter bags using an SKC sampling pump and Tygon\u00ae sample line. Prior to sample collection, the sampling line was purged with air from the railcar for approximately 10 minutes. Additionally, each sample bag was filled and purged three times. Some air samples were also collected into 50 mL glass sample bottles. Gas chromatography analysis of the sample bags and bottles was conducted by the Pittsburgh Safety and Heath Technology Center\u2019s (PS&HTC) Physical and Toxic Agents Division.Sorbent tube sampling was conducted by MSHA for organic vapors, MITC, methylamine, and carbon disulfide in the victim\u2019s railcar (GATX 22394) and inside of railcar GATX 29235. Air samples were collected onto sorbent tubes attached to calibrated SKC low flow sampling pumps. MITC samples were collected at a flow rate of 100 cubic centimeters per minute (cc/min) onto charcoal tubes and analyzed in accordance with OSHA Method ID 7. Methylamine samples were collected at a flow rate of 200cc/min onto XAD-7 tubes and analyzed in accordance with a modified OSHA Method ID 40. Carbon disulfide samples were collected at a flow rate of 200cc/min onto charcoal tubes and analyzed in accordance with NIOSH Sampling and Analytical Method 1622 Draft. Organic vapor samples were collected at flow rate of 100cc/min onto charcoal tubes and analyzed in accordance with MSHA Method P-30.Each sampling train was pre-calibrated with a Bios Defender\u00ae primary calibrator using representative sample media in-line. The ends of the sorbent tubes were opened and attached to each sampling train at the beginning of the sampling period and immediately capped at the completion of sampling. A post flow-rate check was conducted at sampling completion. Samples were refrigerated and shipped overnight to the laboratory. MITC, methylamine, and carbon disulfide samples were submitted for analysis to TestAmerica, an American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) accredited laboratory. Organic vapor samples were submitted for analysis to the PS&HTC\u2019s AIHA-accredited Organics Laboratory in the Physical and Toxic Agents Division.To determine if heat was a potential contributing factor to the fatality, a QuestTemp\u2122 34 wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) monitoring device was lowered into railcar GATX 29235 to monitor temperature and humidity inside of the car. The instrument remained inside of the railcar for approximately one hour.SAMPLING RESULTSSampling results are discussed in this section and presented in Tables 3 and 4 below. Additionally, iBRID monitoring graphs are provided in Appendix B for the oxygen-deficient railcars.On July 21, the oxygen concentration inside of the victim\u2019s railcar (GATX 22394) was 20.9%. No hazardous gases or other contaminants were detected inside of the car. A hazardous atmosphere was not anticipated inside of the victim\u2019s railcar since the manway had remained opened following the incident on July 15.On July 21, MSHA detected an oxygen-deficient environment inside of railcar GATX 29235 immediately upon opening the manway using an iBRID and a Thiele RKI GX-2009 monitor. The oxygen concentration ranged from 4-5% after the sampling line was dropped into the bottom of the car around 12:03 p.m. The sample line remained inside of the railcar until approximately 13:15 p.m., at which time the oxygen concentration was approximately 15% (Appendix B, Figure B1). Gas chromatography analysis of two air samples collected from the railcar confirmed a low oxygen and high nitrogen atmosphere inside the railcar. The first bag sample was collected at 12:35 p.m. and had an oxygen concentration of 14.8% and a nitrogen concentration of 84.2% (Table 4). The average WBGT was 92.3\u00baF inside of railcar GATX 29235. Note: The average temperature on July 21, 2015, was 87\u00baF. The average temperature on July 15, 2015, was 83.1\u00baF.On July 22, monitoring was conducted in three railcars that were unloaded at customer locations (UTLX 300465, GATX 64799, and ACFX 72913). Oxygen was within normal range and no hazardous gases or compounds were detected inside of these railcars.On July 24, monitoring was conducted inside railcar ACFX 79198. Immediately upon opening the manway, an oxygen-deficient environment was detected on two different iBRIDs and a Thiele RKI GX-2009 monitor. The oxygen concentration in the car ranged from 6-7% at 11:14 a.m. to 15% at 12:32 p.m. (Appendix B, Figures B2 and B3). Gas chromatography analysis of four air samples collected from the railcar confirmed a low oxygen, high nitrogen atmosphere inside of the railcar. The first bag sample was collected at 11:22 a.m. and had an oxygen concentration of 7.8% and a nitrogen concentration of 91.2% (Table 4).On July 29, atmospheric monitoring was conducted inside railcar UTLX 300466. Immediately upon opening the manway, an oxygen-deficient environment was detected on two iBRID monitors and on a Thiele MSA Altair multi-gas monitor. The oxygen concentration in the car ranged from 7-8% at 15:24 to 16-17% at 16:36 on two different iBRID monitors (Appendix B, Figures B4 and B5). Gas chromatography analysis of six air samples collected from the railcar confirmed a low oxygen, high nitrogen atmosphere inside of the railcar. An air sample was collected in a bottle at the manway when it was opened at 15:22. The sample had an oxygen concentration of 10.9% and a nitrogen concentration of 88.0%. The first bag sample was collected inside of the car at 15:42 and had an oxygen concentration of 9.8% and a nitrogen concentration of 89.1% (Table 4).On July 30, atmospheric monitoring was conducted inside railcar UTLX 300467. Immediately upon opening the manway cover, an oxygen-deficient environment was detected on an iBRID monitor and a Thiele MSA Altair monitor. The oxygen concentration ranged from 3% at 10:11 a.m. to 20% at 16:28 (Appendix B, Figures B6 and B7). Gas chromatography analysis of nine air samples collected from the railcar confirmed a low oxygen, high nitrogen atmosphere inside the railcar. An air sample was collected in a bottle at the manway when it was opened at 10:10 a.m. The sample had an oxygen concentration of 3.3% and a nitrogen concentration of 95.6%. The first bag sample was collected inside of the car at 10:25 a.m. and had an oxygen concentration of 4.6% and a nitrogen concentration of 94.5%.", "DISCUSSION": "American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z88.2-2015, Practices for Respiratory Protection, defines an Oxygen-Deficiency (Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health) as less than 16% oxygen at sea level.Atmospheric air contains approximately 78.0% nitrogen and 20.9% oxygen. If the nitrogen concentration is too high, it displaces the oxygen and asphyxiation can occur. Nitrogen is safe to breathe only when it is mixed with the appropriate amount of oxygen. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers to maintain workplace oxygen levels between 19.5 and 23.5%. As shown in Table 5, the human body is adversely affected by low concentrations of oxygen. An atmosphere of only 4-6% oxygen causes a victim to fall into a coma in less than 40 seconds. Oxygen must be administered within minutes to offer a chance of survival.The testing of an atmosphere is a key element in any confined space entry. Adequate monitoring primarily involves the following: properly calibrated instruments, employee task training, representative monitoring, and proper interpretation of the results. The number of sensor and battery failures, infrequent calibrations, and general calibration problems indicate that Thiele\u2019s GX-2009 instrument calibration and maintenance program was inadequate. Thiele had only one instrumentician responsible for the calibration and maintenance of the facility\u2019s monitors, Rogers Anderson, Corporate Maintenance Manager. No other Thiele or CVB employees were trained on maintenance or calibration of the monitors. Anderson indicated during interviews with MSHA, that the GX-2009 monitors were being phased out due to numerous problems with oxygen sensor failures.A significant number of alarms and warnings were recorded by the GX-2009 monitors.\u00a0 There is a potential for employees to disregard alarms and warnings that frequently occur.\u00a0 MSHA\u2019s technical support staff analyzed the data that was recorded and stored in the internal memory of the victim\u2019s monitor. The victim\u2019s monitor had the highest number of alarms and warnings.\u00a0 Oxygen warnings (<19.5%) were the most prevalent.\u00a0 A significant number of oxygen alarms (>23.5%) were also observed which indicates that the monitor was improperly zeroed in contaminated air that contained less than 20.9% oxygen.\u00a0During the investigation, numerous respiratory protection deficiencies were observed.\u00a0 Thiele and CVB wash crew employees were provided full-face chemical cartridge respirators.\u00a0 Thiele and CVB did not have respiratory protection procedures in place to address employee medical clearance, fit testing, respirator maintenance, and cartridge replacement.\u00a0 Several dirty respirators were observed lying around and hanging inside of the track shed lockers.\u00a0 The respirators and organic vapor/acid gas cartridges were observed with kaolin slurry splatter.\u00a0 Thiele and CVB employees were observed with significant facial hair and none of the employees had been fit tested or given medical clearance to wear a respirator.\u00a0 Additionally, employees had not been provided with replacement cartridges.\u00a0 Based on the observed condition of the respirator cartridges, breathing would have been significantly restricted when employees wore their respirators.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0WEATHERThe weather condition around the time of the accident was clear with a temperature of 87 degrees Fahrenheit and light winds.\u00a0 Weather was not considered to be a factor in the accident.SUMMARYDuring the investigation, direct-read monitoring and gas chromatography analysis of air samples confirmed the presence of an oxygen-deficient environment inside of four railcars that had been off-loaded at the Chempak facility. Chempak uses plant air and nitrogen at the facility; however only compressor-supplied plant air is used during the off-loading of kaolin slurry at this site. Other compounds were detected during monitoring; however, those compounds were not detected at concentrations considered immediately Dangerous to Life and Health.\u00a0Oxygen-deficient environments can be easily detected through the use of portable gas detectors.\u00a0 Analysis of data recovered from the victim\u2019s GX-2009 monitor indicated that the monitor was not turned on when the victim entered the railcar.\u00a0 Further analysis of data from the victim\u2019s monitor, as well as four other Thiele-owned RKI GX-2009 monitors, revealed numerous problems including: battery and sensor failures, infrequent calibration, no bump testing, and numerous alarms and warnings.\u00a0 The victim\u2019s monitor had the highest number of oxygen sensor failures and oxygen alarms/warnings.\u00a0 At the time of the incident, the victim\u2019s monitor had a bad oxygen sensor that indicated it failed on July 7, 2015 and had not been replaced.\u00a0Thiele was aware of the numerous oxygen sensor failures and problems encountered with the GX-2009 monitors.\u00a0 The victim either forgot to turn the monitor on or intentionally chose to keep the monitor turned off due to the frequency and aggravation of the alarms.\u00a0 Either way, the victim had not been trained on the importance of air monitoring prior to entering a railcar.\u00a0 Appropriate maintenance of Thiele\u2019s gas monitors and training of personnel on confined space monitoring procedures would have prevented this fatality.Training and ExperienceTravis Barnes, victim, had 6 months mining experience all at this facility.\u00a0 Thiele employees were responsible for conducting the contractor\u2019s task training.\u00a0 A representative of MSHA\u2019s Educational Field Services staff conducted an in-depth review of the contractor\u2019s training records.\u00a0 Although the training records documented that task training had been conducted, it was determined by the investigative team that the training was not adequate.\u00a0 Barnes and four other contract car washers were not trained on the health and safety aspects of their job.\u00a0 During the interviewing process, it was discovered that the persons responsible for air monitor training, Jim Dunn and Terry Gilmore, could not verify they had conducted the training.\u00a0 When asked, Gilmore said Dunn does the training and when Dunn was asked, he said Gilmore did the training and he gave an overview of the subject.\u00a0 As an example of the lack of training, the employees each day were to check off on a sheet of paper that they monitored the air for H2S, however the sheet mistakenly said H2G.\u00a0 MSHA\u2019s interviews revealed that no one knew what H2G was and were not aware it was supposed to be H2S, including Gilmore and Dunn. \u00a0The employees stated that the only training they received was that they were to stick the monitor in the railcar and write down what it recorded and that no one ever told them what potential hazards could be associated with the gases they were to monitor.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MSHA issued a noncontributory 104(g)(1) Order.\u00a0 Four miners were withdrawn until the required training was provided.\u00a0 The lack of this task training directly contributed to the accident.\u00a0", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "A root cause analysis was conducted and the following root cause was identified:Root Cause: The mine operator failed to have proper policies and procedures, including training, for miners working in the confined space of the rail car.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Corrective Action: Management established procedures and controls to assure safe rail car entry.\u00a0 A procedure was developed to include life line and attendants, rescue capability, ventilation, and atmospheric monitoring.\u00a0 All miners will be provided adequate task training in the health and safety aspects of this task before performing rail car entry.", "CONCLUSION": "The accident occurred because management policies and procedures failed to address all health and safety hazards associated with cleaning railcars. All hazards were not identified to ensure that persons could safely perform the task.\u00a0 Because of the inadequate policies and procedures, proper task training on the health and safety aspects of the car washing job was not given.\u00a0 Rail tank cars were not treated as a confined space.\u00a0 The air quality inside the tank cars was not properly monitored and an attendant manning a lifeline was not used."}}, "/data-reports/fatality-reports/2015/fatality-12-july-10-2015": {"report-url": "https://www.msha.gov/data-reports/fatality-reports/2015/fatality-12-july-10-2015", "accidnet-classification": "Machinery", "location": "Dry Fork Sand & Gravel, Ohio", "mine-type": "Metal and Non-Metal", "mine-controller": "Heidelberg Cement AG", "mined-mineral": "Construction Sand and Gravel", "incident-date": "2015-07-10T13:30:00-04:00", "public-notice": "This posting serves to provide a public notice to employees of the mine, employees of the mining company(s), employees of independent contractors with any connection to the mine, persons with any connection to the mine, and any person with information regarding the cause or contributing factors of this accident.\nPlease provide any information to:\nMike Wynkoop, Lead Accident InvestigatorPhone:\u00a0724-772-2334\n", "preliminary-report": "On Friday July 10, 2015, two miners were attempting to dislodge the clam shell bucket from the bottom of the pond when the dredge capsized.

Roell, Superintendent, was the person in charge of health and safety at the mine.\u00a0 The mine operates one, 10-hour shift, 5 days per week and employs 6 persons.Material is dredged from the bottom of a man-made lake, screened, and then conveyed from the dredge to the shore via an attached floating belt conveyor system.\u00a0 The material is then transported by truck to a plant for additional sizing and stock piled.\u00a0 The finished product is sold in bulk as construction aggregates, primarily for the ready mix concrete industry.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on November 19, 2014.SIGNIFICANT EVENTS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENTFrom witness statements, the dredge involved in the accident had been used previously to mine material at the James Bunnell Inc.\u2019s Bunnell Gravel Pit #2 (Mine I.D. No. 33-01414).\u00a0 In 1999, a manufacturer\u2019s representative provided two-weeks of hands-on task training for operating the dredge to the dredge operator, Garry L. Dowd.\u00a0 Later that year, Dowd provided a one-week hands-on task training session in dredge operations to William J. Roell.\u00a0 At that time, Todd J. Ernst was the plant manager and Roell was a mechanic.\u00a0 In late 1999, the dredge\u2019s clamshell bucket became stuck at the bottom of the lake.\u00a0 The mine operator detached the bucket, installed a new bucket on shore and used it to dig out the buried bucket.\u00a0 This method followed the manufacturer\u2019s recommended procedures. \u00a0Ernst, Dowd, and Roell all participated in the recovery of the dredge bucket.In 2000, the dredge was moved to Dry Fork Sand & Gravel, its current location.\u00a0 At that time, James Bunnell Inc. owned and operated the mine.\u00a0 Dowd and Roell were moved to the new operation.\u00a0 Dowd continued to operate the dredge and Roell filled in during his absences.\u00a0 In January 2003, Hanson Aggregates Midwest, LLC bought the mine.\u00a0 In 2007, Roell was promoted to the superintendent position.On June 29, 2015, Dowd was placed on extended leave.\u00a0 On the next day, Roell operated the dredge and the clamshell bucket became stuck at the bottom of the lake.\u00a0 According to Dowd, Roell called him on the telephone and discussed the incident.\u00a0 Roell stated that the bucket was stuck at an approximate depth of 65 feet and the hoisting breakers had tripped.\u00a0 Roell asked Dowd if the breakers could be reset.\u00a0 Dowd answered that it was too difficult to explain from his hospital bed and suggested that Roell call Busy Bee Electric, the mine\u2019s electrical contractor.On July 1, 2015, Roell called James Oehlschlaeger, President of Busy Bee Electric.\u00a0 As a result, Oehlschlaeger visited the mine and checked the circuits on the hoist.\u00a0 He found the CR10 and CR11 breakers open, so he reset them.\u00a0 While Oehlschlaeger was still onsite, Roell attempted to hoist the bucket from the lake bottom in manual mode and again tripped the breakers.\u00a0Afterward, Oehlschlaeger showed Roell how to reset the breakers and discussed ways to recover the stuck bucket, including the manufacturer\u2019s recommended method.On the same day, Roell called Ernst, now the Area Manager, and informed him that the dredge bucket was stuck.\u00a0 They also discussed the method that Roell proposed to use to dislodge it from the lake bottom.\u00a0 In his interview, Ernst stated that Roell was going to fill the pontoons with water, tension the hoist rope, clamp the hoist brakes and then pump the water from the pontoons.On July 2, 2015, Roell stopped at F&M Mafco, a nearby heavy equipment supplier, and purchased two industrial strength C-clamps.\u00a0 When Roell arrived at the mine, he assigned Kelly J. Raver, Equipment Operator, and Craig H. Hornberger Sr., Truck Driver, to assist on the dredge.\u00a0 After they boarded the dredge, they proceeded to implement the procedure that Roell had outlined to Ernst on the previous day.\u00a0 Roell cautioned Raver and Hornberger that if they heard anything or felt anything unusual to jump off the dredge.\u00a0 Afterward, they removed the five overload sensors from their associated housings and opened a portion of the pontoon hatches.\u00a0 Then, water was pumped into the pontoons.\u00a0 As the pontoons filled with water, they put the hatch covers back in place but did not secure them.\u00a0 This process lowered the dredge in the water.\u00a0 From witness statements, the \u201cfree board\u201d measured 10 inches (distance from the dredge deck to the water level).\u00a0 At that point, Roell operated the dredge hoist to tension the hoist rope, lowering the dredge further to 4\u00a0inches of free board.\u00a0 Then, as Roell had instructed, Raver and Hornberger installed the C\u2011clamps on the hoist brakes to keep the hoist rope from back-spooling.\u00a0 Next, Raver and Hornberger began to pump water from the flooded pontoons.\u00a0 Roell marked the water level in the \u201cmoon pool\u201d (opening through the middle of the dredge) and they left the dredge.The dredge sat idle in this position for the extended holiday weekend (July 3 through July 5, 2015).\u00a0 On July 6, 2015, Roell called Ernst and reported that the attempt to dislodge the bucket did not work and that he was going to let the dredge sit for a few days before attempting the same procedure again.\u00a0 Ernst agreed with the plan.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On the day of the accident, July 10, 2015, William J. Roell, Superintendent (victim), and Robert E. Cooley, Truck Driver, reported to work at 7:00 a.m., their normal starting time.\u00a0 Roell assigned Cooley to assist on the dredge.\u00a0 Cooley had no experience at working on the dredge and had no knowledge of the previous attempt to recover the bucket.In order to repeat the process, Roell disconnected the C\u2011clamps from the hoist brakes.\u00a0 Next, Cooley assisted Roell in flooding the pontoons with water, lowering the free board to 6 \u00bd inches.\u00a0 Afterward, Roell instructed Cooley to reinstall the C-clamps on the hoist brakes as he tensioned the hoist cable from the operator\u2019s compartment.\u00a0 Then, Cooley and Roell began to pump water from the flooded pontoons.\u00a0 At 11:15 a.m., they stopped for lunch.When they returned to the dredge, Cooley noticed water coming up over the deck.\u00a0 Roell asked Cooley to take the C-clamps off the hoist brakes as he ascended the stairs to the operator\u2019s compartment.\u00a0 Cooley went to the storage room (located in the bottom blue conex) to look for a wrench to loosen the C-clamps.\u00a0 At that time, the dredge was already listing to one side and the tool box had fallen over and the tools were spread out across the floor.\u00a0 When Cooley finally located a crescent wrench, he left the storage room and started up the stairs toward the hoist.\u00a0 As he climbed the stairs, Roell ran down past him.\u00a0 Roell stopped momentarily to tell him that he had already taken the clamps off of the hoist brakes.\u00a0 As Cooley continued to climb the stairs, he heard a very loud bang and the dredge capsized.\u00a0 Cooley was thrown from the stairs and landed in the water.\u00a0 Although injured during the fall, Cooley, wearing his life jacket, managed to stay afloat on the water for some time.\u00a0 During that time, Cooley called Roell repeatedly but did not get a response, so he swam to shore.\u00a0 When Cooley reached the shore, he got in Roell\u2019s pickup truck and drove to the scale house.\u00a0 When Cooley entered, he informed David A. Thierauf, Scale Clerk/Inside Sales, and Thomas R. Roudebush, Office Manager, that the dredge had capsized and Roell was missing.\u00a0 Thierauf immediately called 9-1-1 for emergency assistance.\u00a0 At that time, Todd J. Ernst, Area Manager, entered the scale house and asked them what had happened.\u00a0 As they informed him of the accident, Roudebush left the scale house and went to the mine\u2019s rear entrance to wait for the emergency crews in order to direct them to the accident scene.\u00a0 Ernst proceeded to the lake and traveled along the floating conveyor to the overturned dredge to look for Roell.\u00a0 Ernst called for Roell repeatedly but did not get a response.\u00a0 So, he waited at the dredge for emergency crews to arrive.When the emergency crews arrived, EMT\u2019s treated Cooley for his injuries and transported him to a local hospital for follow-up evaluation and subsequent surgery.\u00a0 The remaining crews requested dive teams be dispatched to the mine.\u00a0 For the next several hours, dive teams searched the wreckage but could not locate Roell.\u00a0 When it became too dark to continue, the search was postponed until the next day.Over the next seven days, divers attempted to find Roell.\u00a0 Because of limited visibility, twisted wreckage under the water and the unexpected movements of the dredge, the dive teams had to proceed with extreme caution.\u00a0 In order to ensure the safety of the divers and the recovery teams on the water, additional time was needed to detach the floating conveyor, cut away cables and dredge components and let the debris settle to the bottom.\u00a0 Inclement weather also caused several delays in the recovery process.On July 18, 2015, divers located the victim (Roell) inside the MCC room (located in the top blue conex).\u00a0 After cutting away the side of the conex, they brought him to the surface.\u00a0 The coroner pronounced him dead at 7:07 p.m.\u00a0 The death certificate listed the cause of death as drowning.\u00a0", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "Robert Olinick, Safety Manager North Region Materials Midwest Central notified MSHA of the accident at 1:37 p.m. on July 10, 2015, by a telephone call to the Department of Labor\u2019s National Contact Center (DOLNCC).\u00a0 The DOLNCC notified Joseph M.

Pace (victim) reported for work at his normal start time of 6:00 a.m. He waited at the mine access gate for Peter C. Johnson, Equipment Operator, who arrived at about 6:15 a.m. and unlocked the gate. Afterward, Pace proceeded to the pit and prepared the screening plant for production. Johnson unlocked the scale house and then traveled the roadways, examining the site and looking for evidence of trespassers. Johnson then went to the mobile equipment parking area and began check-out and start-up of equipment to be used during the shift. When Johnson traveled to the screening plant, Pace was completing his daily maintenance activities. At that time, Johnson began loading customer trucks and Pace began feeding the screening plant with material extracted from the sand bank.About 10:15 a.m., Pace and Johnson took a break since there were no customer trucks in the pit. At 10:35 a.m., Johnson returned to loading customer trucks and Pace returned to feeding the plant. At approximately 10:45 a.m., Johnson drove around the plant to move material from the oversize stacker conveyor and observed Pace\u2019s front-end loader partially buried at the bottom of the sand bank. Pace\u2019s front-end loader was still running with its lights on and the backup alarm sounding. Johnson immediately radioed Anna Pesonen, Scale House Clerk, and asked her to call 9-1-1 for emergency assistance. Johnson then used his front-end loader to dig along the left side of Pace\u2019s machine in an attempt to free it from the fallen material. Pesonen called 9-1-1 and remained on the line with the dispatcher until she heard the sirens from the rescue vehicles arriving onsite.Christopher D. O\u2019Neil, truck driver, was leaving the pit after being loaded and heard Johnson\u2019s radio request to call 9-1-1. O\u2019Neil turned his truck around and returned to the pit. At that time, Johnson was still removing sand from the left side of Pace\u2019s front-end loader. After exiting his truck, O\u2019Neill ran to the right side of Pace\u2019s front-end loader and began digging by hand until he was able to force the right side window open. Then, he began to dig sand from inside of the cab.Joseph M. Southwell, truck driver, had driven to the site to be loaded when he observed the activity around Pace\u2019s front-end loader. Southwell exited his truck and ran to a nearby mini-excavator and trammed it into position along the right rear side of Pace\u2019s machine to assist O\u2019Neil. Johnson asked Southwell to leave the excavator and go get a bulldozer.Arnold J. Werra, truck driver, had his truck on the scale when Pesonen informed him of the accident and asked him to take her van to the pit to assist. Werra obliged and brought shovels with him to Pace\u2019s front-end loader. He helped to dig sand until the local fire department arrived and then he left the mine.Stephen Nava, truck driver, was traveling to the scale house with a loaded truck when he heard the radio calls for help. He waited for the emergency service vehicles to arrive and then escorted them to the scene. After helping them to unload their equipment, Nava drove Southwell to the bulldozer.At approximately 11:00 a.m., the rescue squad took charge of the scene. At that time, Pace was unresponsive and had no vital signs. An attempt was made to pull Pace\u2019s front-end loader out of the sand bank using a tow chain and Johnson\u2019s front-end loader; however, it failed when the tow chain broke. Then, Johnson\u2019s front-end loader and Southwell\u2019s bulldozer were moved into place along the left side of Pace\u2019s front-end loader to shore up the embankment and provide protection for the recovery personnel. At approximately 3:00 p.m., after cutting away the rear window and using a vacuum truck to extract material from inside of the cab, Pace was removed from the machine. The cause of death was attributed to compressional asphyxiation.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "MSHA was notified of the accident at 11:14 a.m. on June 30, 2015, by a telephone call from Robert Haggerty, Safety Director, to the Department of Labor\u2019s National Contact Center (DOLNCC).

near the southwest corner of the property.\u00a0 An access road crossed a dike between two cranberry bogs and entered the working area from the east.\u00a0 The top of the pit slope was situated about 500 feet north of the access road (also referred to as a bog road) and near the northern boundary of phase 4.\u00a0 The bottom of the slope was less than 400 feet from the access road.\u00a0 The pit bottom dipped, less than 3 percent, toward the face of the slope.The work area included an excavation into the sand bank, the portable screening plant and stacker conveyor area, and the stockpile and loadout areas.\u00a0 The excavation into the sand bank was v-shaped with an entrance about 120 feet wide near the toe of the reclaimed slope and narrowing to the north.\u00a0 At about 120 feet into the v-shaped excavation, the pit was about 35 feet wide.\u00a0 The v-shaped excavation was approximately 170 feet deep from the entrance.\u00a0 About a month prior to the accident, the excavation was about 130 feet deep from the entrance. \u00a0At the time of the accident, the victim was operating a front-end loader on the pit bottom, excavating material from the base of the sand bank.\u00a0 The front-end loader was facing north and was reportedly backing up when the failure occurred.\u00a0 The failure occurred near the top of the slope in the northwest corner of the excavation (see Figure 1).\u00a0 The failed material slid in a southeasterly direction and covered the loader.\u00a0 Sand and gravel broke through the windshield and engulfed the victim.\u00a0At the north end of the excavation, the slope was about 120 feet high and had an overall inclination of about 41 degrees from horizontal.\u00a0 However, the upper 80 feet was steeper than 44\u00a0degrees and the top 15 feet of the slope had an inclination of about 58 degrees from horizontal (see Figure 2).Post-failure measurements determined that the slope in the northwest corner was about 128 feet high and had an overall inclination of about 40 degrees from horizontal.\u00a0 The top 45 feet of the failed slope had an average inclination of about 48 degrees and the top 21 feet had an inclination of about 55 degrees from horizontal.Material Description\u00a0\nThe material being mined was sand and gravel.\u00a0 The gravel was rounded and the sand appeared to be predominantly fine grained.\u00a0 The in situ material was dense, moist, and light brown in color.\u00a0 Dense, moist sand can exhibit an apparent cohesion due to surface tension and negative capillary pore water pressure.\u00a0 This strength is moisture sensitive and transitory.\u00a0 Dry sand and saturated sand will lose all apparent cohesion.\u00a0 The sand and gravel at Pit 46 appeared to exhibit these qualities.\u00a0 At its natural moisture, this material had an apparent cohesion, which was moisture sensitive.\u00a0 As this material was exposed to the air and sun, it lost some of its natural moisture, lost its cohesive strength, and sloughed off.\u00a0 As the sand dried, its color changed to light tan.\u00a0 The dry, loose sand and gravel had an angle of repose of about 33 degrees.\u00a0 The sloughed material piled at the bottom of the bank and was mined.Equipment and Mining Practice\nThe mining practice employed in this pit used two rubber-tired front-end loaders (Caterpillar 980G and Caterpillar 972M), a track-mounted bulldozer (Caterpillar D8R), and an off-road haul truck.\u00a0 A portable screening plant (Roadrunner CEC) and stacker conveyor (80-foot Anaconda) were used to segregate and stow the sand and gravel.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, the victim was operating the Caterpillar 972M front-end loader.The company did not have a specific mining plan; however, mining had most recently started in the phase 4 area and had been advancing in a northerly direction.\u00a0 In general, the mining method employed during phase 4 consisted of excavating material from the base of the slope using a front-end loader.\u00a0 Joseph Southwell indicated that failures did occur and that the failures (sloughing) usually occurred when the natural material dried, which could be during the day or overnight.\u00a0 Reportedly, a front-end loader would excavate the loose material that had fallen from the sand bank.\u00a0 When all the loose material was removed, the operator would excavate into the undisturbed sand bank and move along the base until more material fell to the bottom.\u00a0 The front-end loader excavating the sand bank loaded the raw material into the screen.\u00a0 The sand was stockpiled using a stacker conveyor directly from the screen plant.\u00a0 The gravel was piled near the plant.\u00a0 A second equipment operator used a front-end loader to move the gravel portion to separate stockpiles and loaded customer trucks from the sand and gravel stockpiles.Engineering Evaluation\nAt its natural moisture, this material has an apparent cohesion, which is moisture sensitive.\u00a0 As the material is exposed to the air and sun it loses some of its natural moisture, loses its cohesive strength and sloughs off.\u00a0 The material being mined was mostly sand with an angle of repose of about 33 degrees.\u00a0 However, the slope in natural material above the loose material was steeper than 33 degrees.\u00a0 The average inclination of the slope in natural material was 48 degrees or more and the slopes near the top of the bank were measured to be up to 58 degrees from horizontal.\u00a0Mining from the bottom of the slope relies upon material sliding to the pit bottom as the front-end loader removes material from the toe.\u00a0 In this practice a relatively controlled shallow failure is induced by oversteepening the slope through removal of material from the toe.\u00a0 A hazardous condition can develop when the material does not fail and slide shortly after excavation at the toe and the slope becomes oversteepened by the mining process.\u00a0 Due to the apparent cohesion of the sandy material, slopes steeper than the angle of repose can stand for a period of time, but may fail suddenly.\u00a0 With increasing height and oversteepening of the slope there is a decrease in stability and an increase in the volume of material that can potentially fail, both of which increase the hazard.\u00a0 It is a good practice to move to flatter sloping areas when a significant portion of the slope becomes oversteepened.In some cases, removal of loose drier material from the bottom would induce failures that expose moist material that is oversteepened near the top of the slope.\u00a0 In this case, the hazard also increases with the total height above the pit bottom, due to an increase in the potential energy of the falling material, and the height of the oversteepened portion above the loose material, which increases the potential volume.\u00a0 Removal of the flatter sloping material from the toe exposes more of the oversteepened slope above, subjecting the bank to larger failures, and also moves the front-end loader closer to the oversteepened slope.\u00a0 At Pit 46, it was primarily the natural material that was moist and would stand oversteepened.Weather\nOn the day of the accident, weather conditions were clear with temperatures in the low 80\u2019s.\u00a0 Average wind speed was 3 mph with gusts up to 20 mph.\u00a0 On Sunday, June 28, 2015, two days before the accident, the recorded total rainfall for the area was 0.84 inches.\u00a0 On the previous Sunday, the area had 0.81 inches of rainfall.\u00a0 The investigators determined that the resultant wet conditions present at Pit 46, due to previous rainfall in the area, likely contributed to triggering the failure.Seismicity\nThe United State Geological Survey website had no record of an earthquake greater than a magnitude M1.5 within 50\u00a0miles of the site during the month of June 2015.\u00a0 The investigators concluded that the failure was not triggered by an earthquake.Summary\nThe operator was relying upon the process of natural and excavation induced failures to feed material to the pit bottom.\u00a0 However, prolonged excavation at the toe of the sand bank created an oversteepened slope above the front-end loader.\u00a0 The height of the oversteepened slope above the pit bottom was also excessive and unsafe to work below.\u00a0 The great height of the sand bank contributed to the instability, and worsened the hazard by increasing the potential volume of material that could fail and the energy it had in falling.\u00a0 Rainfall likely contributed to the instability and triggered the failure event by increasing the weight of the material.\u00a0 The additional moisture infiltrating the natural material may have also contributed by reducing the apparent cohesion.\u00a0 The excavation into the toe of the slope was also a triggering event for the failure.The active pit area was about 170 feet long and about 120 feet wide at its open end, which narrowed to about 35 feet wide near the back end of the front-end loader.\u00a0 This pit configuration created a relatively narrow work space with pit slopes on three sides of the front-end loader.\u00a0 The narrow pit dimensions exacerbated the consequences of the failure by reducing the area that falling material had to fill and exposing the front-end loader operator to additional oversteepened sand bank slopes.Although the mine operator had used bulldozers in the past to push the bank material down to a flatter slope, this mining practice had not been employed during this phase of mining.", "TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE": "Charles E. Pace had 19 years and 8 weeks of mining experience as an equipment operator, including 11 years and 8 weeks at this mine. A representative of MSHA\u2019s Educational Field and Small Mines Services reviewed the mine operator\u2019s Part 46 training records for Pace. The reviewer concluded that Pace had received all required training; however, the task training provided was not documented as required. A noncontributory citation was issued during an E16 Spot Inspection for this violation.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "A root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified.Root Cause: Management failed to utilize previously established mining methods to maintain wall, bank, and slope stability in the area. The mine operator had used bulldozers in the past to push the bank material down to a flatter slope; however, this mining practice had not been employed during this phase of mining. The victim was extracting material from the base of a 128 feet high bank that was not sloped to a safe angle.Corrective Action: Management established and implemented new policies and procedures to reclaim the existing phase 4 excavation (accident area). In addition, new policies and procedures were made to address future excavations at the mine. These new policies and procedures utilize bulldozers to push material down the slope toward the face of the excavation while maintaining a uniform slope gradient of 2.5:1 to 3:1. Future excavations will have a minimum working width of 300 feet, sloped on all three sides. The slope gradients will be monitored on a daily basis. Material pushed down the slope will be windrowed or stockpiled and will be loaded and transported to the screening plant. All mobile equipment operators were trained in these new policies and procedures.Root Cause: Management failed to adequately examine the mining area prior to commencing work and periodically throughout the shift as changing ground conditions warranted.Corrective Action: Management established and implemented an examination plan for the mining area and designated an exam coordinator, responsible for ensuring adequate examinations and monitoring slope gradients. Examinations of the face of the slope and side slopes will be conducted each day prior to the start of excavation and as weather conditions dictate, particularly during and after precipitation events. The slope surfaces will be evaluated for bulging, cuts, seepage, and cracking. Any adverse conditions found will be corrected prior to the commencement of mining in the area. Mining will also cease at any time during the shift when adverse conditions are encountered until they can be evaluated and addressed. All mobile equipment operators were trained by the exam coordinator in the new examination plan relative to identifying adverse ground conditions, changing slope conditions, and remedial actions.", "CONCLUSION": "The accident occurred due to mine management\u2019s failure to establish mining methods to maintain wall, bank, and slope stability in the area. The victim was extracting material from the base of a 128 feet high bank that was not sloped to a safe angle. In addition, management failed to adequately examine the mining area prior to commencing work and periodically throughout the shift as changing ground conditions warranted."}}, "/data-reports/fatality-reports/2015/fatality-8-june-27-2015": {"report-url": "https://www.msha.gov/data-reports/fatality-reports/2015/fatality-8-june-27-2015", "accidnet-classification": "Falling, Rolling, or Sliding Rock or Material of Any Kind", "location": "4 West Mine, Pennsylvania", "mine-type": "Coal", "mine-controller": "Mepco Intermediate Holdings, LLC", "mined-mineral": "Coal (Bituminous)", "incident-date": "2015-06-27T23:30:00-04:00", "public-notice": "This posting serves to provide a public notice to employees of the mine, employees of the mining company(s), employees of independent contractors with any connection to the mine, persons with any connection to the mine, and any person with information regarding the cause or contributing factors of this accident.\nPlease provide any information to:\nWalter Young, Lead Accident InvestigatorPhone:\u00a0724.627.5558, Ext 234\n", "preliminary-report": "On June 27, 2015, at approximately 11:30 p.m., a fatal accident occurred at the 4 West Mine in the No. 4 Entry of the 10 Right Area of the mine just inby the No. 63 Crosscut.

Daniel Acker was positioned between the saw and the ledge, when he tripped and fell. The victim and the saw went over the 4\u00bd-foot ledge, resulting in the saw falling on him.The accident occurred due to the victim\u2019s failure to maintain control of the self-propelled concrete saw that he was operating in reverse gear while repositioning to cut stone.", "GENERAL INFORMATION": "Kane\u2019s Quarry, a surface dimension stone mine, is located near Montrose, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. The principal operating official was Daniel Acker, Owner/Operator (victim). The mine typically operates one 8-hour shift, 5 days per week. Dimensional stone is removed from multiple benches using a self-propelled concrete saw. The saw operator follows a grid pattern laid out on each bench prior to cutting. Cut blocks or slabs are removed and transported to the yard for processing or shipment. The stone is sold for use in construction and landscaping. The investigators found that Daniel Acker had operated the mine for approximately three years at this location. Mr. Acker never applied for a MSHA identification number by submitting the MSHA Form 2000-7. Therefore, MSHA had never inspected this mine. The mine had reopened about four weeks prior to the accident following a winter shutdown. Daniel Acker had not notified the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) of the commencement of operations at the site as required by 30 CFR \u00a756.1000. A non-contributory citation was issued for this violation.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On the day of the accident, March 23, 2015, Daniel Acker and Dylan Acker (victim\u2019s son), Miner, arrived for work at 7:00 a.m., their normal start time. Due to inclement weather and icy conditions, they left the mine and returned about 12:30 p.m. At that time, the ice had melted from the active bench; however, the lower bench or sump area was still iced over. Daniel Acker started the saw and began cutting stone. At approximately 2:30 p.m., after making four north-to-south cuts and three west-to-east cuts, Daniel Acker attempted to reposition the saw and fell over the 4\u00bd-foot ledge to the sump area below, resulting in the saw falling on him.Dylan Acker was working near the upper access road and witnessed the accident. He immediately ran down to the sump, turned the saw off, and called 9-1-1 for emergency assistance. While waiting for help to arrive, Dylan Acker administered Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). At 2:39 p.m., Emergency Medical Services (EMS) arrived at the mine access road and cut the lock on the entrance gate to enter the mine. After checking the victim, EMS requested assistance from Anthony J. Conarton, Susquehanna County Coroner, who pronounced the victim dead at the accident site. The cause of death was attributed to exsanguination (severe loss of blood).", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "MSHA was notified of the accident at 3:46 p.m. on March 23, 2015, by a telephone call from the Susquehanna County 911 Operations Center to the National Call Center. The National Call Center notified Joseph M. Denk, Staff Assistant, and an investigation was started the same day. An order was issued under provisions of Section 103(k) of the Mine Act after the arrival of an Authorized Representative at the mine site.MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed the mine employee, and reviewed work procedures relevant to the accident. MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection\u2019s Bureau of Mine Safety, the Susquehanna County Coroner\u2019s Office, and local and State law enforcement.", "DISCUSSION": "GeologyThe mining product consists of bluestone rock from the Catskill geologic formation. Bluestone is a unique sandstone formation found primarily in northeastern Pennsylvania and south-central New York. As sediments fossilized into rock, minerals carried by groundwater through the rock deposits created various colored strata. Bluestone derived its name from its typical blue color. Bluestone is characterized as a strong, stable rock that is resistant to cracking and does not discolor. Bluestone is typically marketed commercially in two types: dimensional (architectural grade) used for stair steps, flooring, countertops, etc.; and flagstone used for walls, walkways, and patios.Mining MethodOverburden is removed by a track-mounted front-end loader exposing the top layer of stone. A rectangular grid pattern using \u201cchalk lines\u201d is laid out on each bench for use as a guide during the extraction process. A walk-behind, self-propelled concrete saw is used to cut the slabs or blocks of stone from the bench. The cutting depth typically ranges from 15 to 17 inches. The saw operator positions several steel plates on the bench floor and levels each plate using wooden wedges or broken pieces of stone. This allows the saw operator to maneuver the saw on a level surface to produce a more uniform cut. The saw operator makes a series of cuts in the same direction along the chalk lines in each row of the grid. The steel plates are advanced to the next chalk line for each cut. The saw operator then turns the saw 90 degrees and cuts along the perpendicular chalk lines to complete the rectangular shape of each block. This sequence of steps is repeated until all of the cuts are made for the grid on each bench. The blocks or slabs are then removed with a skidsteer loader and transported to a yard where they are split into approximate 1-inch-thick flagstones. The flagstones are then stacked on wooden pallets and sold to customers as construction or decorative stone.Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred in the center of the quarry pit near the sump area (see Figure 1). A 25-foot-high waste pile of rocks is located to the east of the sump area, and the quarry access road and yard processing area are located to the west of the sump area. The sump area dimensions are approximately 40 feet wide by 80 feet long. Two benches had been created within the bluestone outcrop at the south end of the sump area. The upper bench is approximately 16 feet wide and the lower bench is approximately 18 feet wide. The high-wall above the upper bench is about 15 feet high and the high-wall above the lower bench is approximately 19\u00bd feet high. Therefore, there is a 4\u00bd-foot height difference between the two benches. The exposed edge (drop-off) is oriented north to south and is approximately 10 feet long. The drop-off has a slope angle between 45 and 55 degrees. There is no berm or barrier installed along the edge of the upper bench. Prior to the accident, the victim had made four north-to-south cuts and three west-to-east cuts along the upper bench. At the time of the accident, he was repositioning the saw for a fourth west-to-east cut across the bench. During this repositioning, with his back facing the edge, the victim slipped and fell onto the lower bench.Concrete SawThe saw involved in the accident is a MECO (Husqvarna), Model 40D, walk-behind concrete saw manufactured in 2005. The saw is a self-propelled circular saw equipped with a 42-inch-diameter water-cooled blade. An air-cooled Hatz, Model 2M41Z, 34-horsepower, diesel engine powers the blade and the hydrostatic drive system. The machine is equipped with a 12-volt electrical system and electric starter. The saw operator stands at the rear of the machine and maneuvers the saw on its four wheels using two 32-inch-long non-retractable handlebars. The approximately 1,860 pound unit is approximately 70 inches long (not including the handlebars), 48 inches high, and 35 inches wide. After the accident, the saw was found in the reverse gear, and the left handlebar was bent up slightly.WeatherThe weather on the day of the accident consisted of a high temperature of 22 degrees Fahrenheit. Sunrise was at 7:03 a.m. In the morning, the area experienced some minor snow fall and temperatures in the lower teens. Dylan Acker indicated that due to the poor weather conditions in the morning, he and his father left the mine and returned about 12:30 p.m. Weather was not considered to contribute to the accident.", "TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE": "\nDaniel Acker had approximately 20 years mining experience with no formal training.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "\nThe investigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified the following root cause:\u00a0Root Cause:\u00a0The victim failed to maintain control of the self-propelled concrete saw that he was operating in reverse gear while repositioning to cut stone. No procedures were in place for persons to safely operate the walk-behind, self-propelled concrete saw on an elevated bench.Corrective Action:\u00a0The victim was a sole proprietor and; therefore, the business terminated at the time of his death. Consequently, no corrective action was taken.", "CONCLUSION": "\nThe accident occurred due to the victim\u2019s failure to maintain control of the self-propelled concrete saw that he was operating in reverse gear while repositioning to cut stone."}}, "/data-reports/fatality-reports/2015/fatality-5-march-17-2015": {"report-url": "https://www.msha.gov/data-reports/fatality-reports/2015/fatality-5-march-17-2015", "accidnet-classification": "Powered Haulage", "location": "Ulrich Pit, Nebraska", "mine-type": "Metal and Non-Metal", "mine-controller": "Scott  Ulrich; Wes  Ulrich", "mined-mineral": "Construction Sand and Gravel", "incident-date": "2015-03-17T18:12:00-04:00", "public-notice": "This posting serves to provide a public notice to employees of the mine, employees of the mining company(s), employees of independent contractors with any connection to the mine, persons with any connection to the mine, and any person with information regarding the cause or contributing factors of this accident.\nPlease provide any information to:\nMichael Treloar, Lead Accident InvestigatorPhone:\u00a0303.231.5465\n", "preliminary-report": "The victim was operating a loaded articulated haul truck on an elevated haul road adjacent to a dredge pond.

Koontz examined the area, the crew returned to the face to shovel. \u00a0After approximately five minutes, the decision was made to remove the miners from the area again and blast the second set of holes. \u00a0The first two blasts were completed at approximately 1:30 p.m.\u00a0 The area was examined again by R. Koontz, and the crew returned to the face to shovel the blasted material onto the panline. \u00a0The crew loaded the face conveyor chain and ran it multiple times to transport the material off the face.The crew continued to drill additional holes in the mine floor for blasting. \u00a0A set of five holes and a set of six holes were drilled in the area near the No. 3 and No. 5 shields. The afternoon shift was scheduled to blast these holes upon arrival on the section. \u00a0Lipinski, E. Koontz, and R. Koontz left the 12-East Longwall at 2:30 p.m. to meet with\u00a0\nBrian Hennebert, Longwall Production Foreman, Mike Kozak, Assistant Director of Longwalls for Murray Energy, and Garloch to discuss plans for the afternoon shift.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Garloch then traveled underground to the 14-West Longwall where the mine\u2019s other longwall was being moved. \u00a0His plans were to check on the longwall move and then travel to 12-East Longwall to assist with correcting the out-of-seam condition.Kozak and Hennebert rode into the mine with the afternoon shift crew and arrived on the 12-East Longwall at approximately 4:30 p.m. \u00a0Kozak was in charge of the blasting work on afternoon shift and he informed the crew of the plan to blast the coal between the panline and the face. \u00a0The crew was moved outby the longwall face so the holes drilled by day shift could be loaded and blasted.\u00a0 The two blasts were made at approximately 5:30 p.m. \u00a0Kozak examined the area and the crew returned to the face to shovel.\u00a0 A crack was observed in the face near the area of No.5 shield.\u00a0 While the crew shoveled the blasted material onto the panline, the face conveyor chain was loaded and ran multiple times to transport the material off the face.\u00a0The crew began drilling more holes for additional blasting. \u00a0Two sets of five holes were drilled at an angle underneath the panline in the area between the No. 2 to No. 6 shields. The crew was moved outby the longwall face between 7:45 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., so the holes could be loaded and blasted. \u00a0At this time, Garloch arrived on the 12-East Longwall. \u00a0After the two blasts were made, Hennebert, Kozak, Garloch, and Richard Miller, Maintenance Foreman, went to examine the face area.The area was examined by Kozak, determined to be safe, and the miners traveled back to the longwall face to continue work. \u00a0Charles Neitzelt, Shearer Operator, and Hennebert jack hammered under the panline at the edge of the No. 3 and No. 4 shields to remove the coal.\u00a0 The remaining crew members shoveled the blasted material from the No. 2 to No. 6 shields onto the panline. \u00a0Ken Torac, Loader Operator; Colby Yarbrough, Miner Bolter; and Chris Cox, Rib Bolter Operator, began installing roof bolts around the No. 7 shield and bolted toward the tailgate.At approximately 8:55 p.m., shortly after running shoveled material off the face conveyor chain, a piece of coal and rock fell from the face between the No. 4 and No. 6 shield, striking Garloch, Hennebert, Neitzelt, and Josh Roth, Shuttle Car Operator. \u00a0The material was approximately 10 feet long, five feet wide, and up to two feet thick.\u00a0 Roth, who was standing at the edge of the No. 5 and No. 6 shield, was struck in the left shoulder and knocked to the ground. \u00a0A piece of the material pinned his leg, but it was quickly removed by crew members standing nearby. \u00a0Neitzelt and Hennebert were knocked to the ground and pinned by the fallen material.\u00a0 Coworkers freed Neitzelt and Hennebert when Kozak and John Beattie, Faceman, noticed that Garloch was under the rock. \u00a0Kozak, Beattie, and other crew members attempted to lift the rock off of Garloch, but were unsuccessful. \u00a0Beattie checked for a pulse, but none was detected.\u00a0 While they continued to free Garloch, other crew members ran outby to retrieve first-aid materials and additional tools to help lift the rock. \u00a0The crew members returned to the face with jacks, crib blocks and cap boards. \u00a0The rock was raised up with the jacks and blocked, freeing the victim.The victim was placed on a backboard and transported to the Mac-8 emergency ride located in the last open crosscut at crosscut #29. \u00a0Matt Remke, Longwall Shield Operator/Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), and Beattie placed the Automated External Defibrillator (AED) on Garloch\u2019s chest, but no heart rhythms were detected.\u00a0 The victim was transferred to a rail-mounted mantrip and transported to the Cameron Portal elevator.\u00a0 The mantrip was met by Chad Lucas, EMT, who administered Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) to the victim while on the elevator.\u00a0 The victim was transported from the mine site by Cameron Emergency Medical Services (EMS). \u00a0Dr. Katherine Langley, M.D. with West Virginia University Hospital (WVUH) Medcom, pronounced the victim dead at 9:45 p.m., while in transport to Reynolds Memorial Hospital in Glen Dale, West Virginia.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "Richard Marcavitch, Director of Safety, notified the MSHA Call Center at 9:11 p.m., on Sunday, March 8, 2015, and reported a rib roll had occurred on the 12-East Longwall and one miner was trapped under a rock. \u00a0Chad Currence, Bridgeport Field Office Supervisor, received notification of the accident from the call center at 9:19 p.m. \u00a0Currence contacted the mine and issued a verbal 103(j) order at 9:30 p.m., to ensure the safety and health of the miners and to preserve the accident scene. \u00a0Nicholas Blevins, Mining Engineer - Roof Control, and Michael Kelley, Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Specialist\u00a0 - Roof Control, were immediately dispatched to the mine by Michael Stark, Staff Assistant. \u00a0The 103(j) order was modified to a 103(k) order upon arrival at the mine.The accident investigation was conducted by MSHA personnel in conjunction with the West Virginia Office of Miner\u2019s Health, Safety, and Training (WVMHS&T), Ohio Valley Resources, Inc., and the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). \u00a0The investigation was initiated on the day of the accident. \u00a0Upon arrival to the mine, the accident investigation team was briefed of the circumstances of the accident. \u00a0Prior to going underground, preliminary discussions were conducted with the afternoon shift miners assigned to work on the 12-East Longwall. \u00a0The investigation team travelled to the accident scene to make observations, take measurements, and take photographs. \u00a0Following the initial underground investigation, the 103(k) order was modified to allow the mine operator to survey and map the accident scene (See Appendix A).On Monday, March 9, 2015, Eric Case, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, arrived at the mine on day shift to continue the investigation along with Carlos Mosley, District Manager and Stark. \u00a0Additional photographs and measurements were taken and additional relevant documents obtained.On Tuesday, March 10, 2015, the miners assigned to work on the 12-East Longwall on the day shift prior to the accident were interviewed (See Appendix B).On Tuesday, March 17, 2015, and Wednesday, March 18, 2015, formal interviews were conducted at the Murray Energy Training Center located near Moundsville, West Virginia. \u00a0Representatives of the victim\u2019s family were present during the interviews (See Appendix C).Discussion12-east Longwall\u00a0\nThe accident occurred on the 12-East Longwall face at the No. 4 shield, approximately 12 feet from the headgate end of the face. \u00a0The longwall equipment mines the coal block between the 12-East headgate section and the 11-East tailgate section. \u00a0The longwall panel is approximately 1,400 feet wide and 6,800 feet long. \u00a0At the time of the accident, the headgate had retreated to survey station (spad) No. 29+48 and the tailgate had retreated to spad No. 29+10.\u00a0 The last open crosscut was located at the No. 29 block, between the No. 2 and No. 3 entries. \u00a0The 12-East Longwall headgate overburden thickness was 1,008 feet at the time of the accident. \u00a0An Analysis of Longwall Pillar Stability (ALPS) determined the pillar stability factor in the area. \u00a0The analysis showed the loading in the headgate area had a stability factor of 2.83.\u00a0 The pillar design parameters present near the accident location were used in the analysis. \u00a0The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended pillar stability factor for retreat longwall mining is 1.30. \u00a0The pillar design was adequate for handling the overburden weight and exceeded the recommended stability factor.Face ConditionThe out-of-seam face was approximately seven feet high prior to the drilling and blasting process.\u00a0 Throughout the day shift and afternoon shift, the face height increased from seven feet to approximately 12 feet, due to the removal of the material in front of and under the pan line. \u00a0The face strata from the mine floor to the roof was approximately four feet of coal, one foot of rock binder, two feet of coal, and five feet of laminated shale at the time of the accident.The increased face height caused the heavier shale rock (approximately 170 lbs/ft2) to put pressure on the weaker, unconfined coal face (approximately 80 lbs/ft2). The pressure caused the coal face to slough off during afternoon shift. \u00a0As the shift progressed, the movement in the shale strata created a crack in the face at the No. 5 shield. \u00a0The crack grew larger, forming a separation that could only be seen from the tailgate side looking towards the headgate. \u00a0The rock fell from the face from the same area where the crack was seen.\u00a0 MSHA Investigators however, cannot definitively say that the crack caused the fall.\u00a0 The material that fell from the face measured approximately 12 feet long, 5 feet wide, and up to 2 feet thick.\u00a0 The piece broke and the material that struck the victim measured approximately 10 feet long, 5 feet wide, and up to 2 feet thick.Roof Control PlanThe last fully revised and consolidated roof control plan for this mine was approved by MSHA on March 28, 2013, with nine revisions since that time. \u00a0This mine has rib bolting procedures that are to be used during continuous mining machine development. \u00a0Rib bolting is also required when mining trenches for belt or overcast installations when the height exceeds 10 feet. \u00a0The roof control plan had requirements when work is performed between the panline and the longwall face. \u00a0The face conveyor breaker must be placed in the lock out position and the rib or face shall be tested and any loose material shall be secured or pulled down before performing such work. \u00a0Where the distance between the shield tips and face exceeds five feet, temporary supports shall be installed in the work area. \u00a0The distance from the tip of the shield to the face was in excess of five feet where Garloch was working when the accident occurred.\u00a0 The roof from No. 6 shield to the headgate had been fully roof bolted.\u00a0 However, no face supports were installed where Garloch was working.Mining MethodLongwall mining is dependent on maintaining the longwall face in the center of the gate entries as it is retreated out of the panel.\u00a0 Uneven retreat of the face ends can cause the longwall mining machine to shift off the gate center.\u00a0 When the longwall shifts too far to one end or the other, the shearer does not have clearance to properly cut out the solid coal block.\u00a0 This will leave stumps of coal in the roof and floor.\u00a0 The headgate or tailgate panline will begin to ride up on the coal stump and the shearer cannot properly clean the cuttings from in front of the panline.\u00a0 This condition will worsen and create an out-of-seam condition, if not recognized and corrected.\u00a0The 12 East Longwall production records for the 10 days preceding the accident were reviewed to determine the mining practices and rates of retreat.\u00a0 Mine management normally operates the 12 East Longwall face with the tailgate face location retreated 15 feet further out of the panel than the headgate face location.\u00a0 The midnight shift crew normally mined extra cuts off the tailgate end to maintain this differential from February 26th until March 3rd.\u00a0\u00a0 The extra cuts were not taken on March 3, 2015, and by the end of the shift the tailgate end was only 4 feet outby the headgate.\u00a0 No extra cuts off the tailgate end were taken over the next several shifts and by the end of midnight shift on March 5, 2015, the headgate end was 24 feet outby the tailgate end.\u00a0 This differential caused the longwall face to shift toward the tailgate entry.The operator directed extra cuts to be mined off the tailgate end to shift the longwall face back toward the headgate and additional clean up passes were made with the shearer to remove more material from in front of the panline.\u00a0 These actions were unsuccessful.\u00a0 On Day Shift, March 6, 2015, management noticed that the headgate end panline were climbing up and creating an out-of-seam condition.The afternoon shift crew continued to take cuts off the tailgate end, but the condition worsened and by the end of the shift, the panline had climbed an additional four feet and the shearer was cutting approximately five feet of rock. The No. 2 shield became fouled and would no longer pull in due to the elevated panline so management decided to halt production and take other measures to correct the condition.\u00a0 The tailgate end of the longwall face was retreated 38 feet outby the headgate at this time.\u00a0ExaminationsThe mine operator is required to conduct examinations of work areas for hazardous conditions and violations of mandatory health and safety standards. \u00a0The mine operator is required to conduct additional examinations following blasting work to identify misfires, methane, or other hazardous conditions. \u00a0Near the beginning of afternoon shift, a crack appeared in front of the No.5 shield. \u00a0As the shift progressed, the crack reportedly grew larger. \u00a0Two additional examinations were made as a result of blasting on afternoon shift. \u00a0These examinations did not identify the crack. \u00a0During the investigation, the crack was not visible in face. \u00a0Therefore, investigators were not able to determine if the crack contributed to the fatal accident. \u00a0A non-contributory violation was issued for 30 CFR 75.1326 because of these examinations.Experience and TrainingGarloch had 12 years and 48 weeks of total mining experience; all at this mine. \u00a0A review of the training records showed Garloch was provided annual refresher training on April 2, 2014. \u00a0The records also indicate Garloch was task trained for operating the longwall.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "An analysis was conducted to identify the underlying cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \u00a0Causal factors were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below are the factors identified during the analysis and the corrective actions that were implemented to prevent a similar reoccurrence.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator failed to adequately support the roof, face, and ribs of areas where miners work or travel.Corrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator revised the roof control plan to address out-of-seam conditions. \u00a0The revision stipulates the procedures and equipment needed to protect the miners from fall of roof, face, and ribs.\u00a0 The affected miners were trained in the revised roof control plan.\u00a0 The revised safety precautions will be reviewed with all miners prior to working in the affected area.Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not have effective policies, programs, procedures, or training programs in place to ensure that proper actions are taken to limit or prevent the longwall from shifting off of proper alignment and mining off-center.Corrective Action:The mine operator established a training program for all miners that work on the longwall.\u00a0 The training program outlines the procedures or actions that should be taken to limit or prevent the longwall from mining out-of-seam.\u00a0\u00a0 All affected miners were trained in the new procedures.Root Cause:\u00a0\u00a0The mine operator did not have effective policies, programs, procedures, or controls in place to protect miners from a fall of the longwall face while miners are positioned on the panline or between the panline and the longwall face.Corrective Action:\u00a0\u00a0The mine operator revised the roof control plan. \u00a0The revision stipulates the procedures and equipment needed to protect the miners from fall of roof and face if miners are required to be on the face side of the panline for any reason.\u00a0 The affected miners were trained in the revised roof control plan.\u00a0 The revised safety precautions will be reviewed with all miners prior to working in the affected area."}}, "/data-reports/fatality-reports/2015/fatality-2-february-20-2015": {"report-url": "https://www.msha.gov/data-reports/fatality-reports/2015/fatality-2-february-20-2015", "accidnet-classification": "Fall of Roof or Back", "location": "Heilwood, Pennsylvania", "mine-type": "Coal", "mine-controller": "J Clifford  Forrest III", "mined-mineral": "Coal (Bituminous)", "incident-date": "2015-02-20T17:59:00-05:00", "public-notice": "This posting serves to provide a public notice to employees of the mine, employees of the mining company(s), employees of independent contractors with any connection to the mine, persons with any connection to the mine, and any person with information regarding the cause or contributing factors of this accident.\nPlease provide any information to:\nKerry Miller, Lead Accident InvestigatorPhone:\u00a0814.266.0008\n\u00a0\n", "preliminary-report": "On February 20, 2015, at approximately 2:00 p.m., a 29 year old roof bolter helper received fatal injuries when he was pinned between a piece of roof rock and the top of the drill canopy in the No. 2 Slope Entry, 180 feet inby survey station No. 4794 in the A Mains, MMU 001.

Mumau and Trimble finished bolting the number 3 entry. \u00a0The continuous mining machine operator, Jim Frantz, mined 10 feet in the number 4 entry, and then trammed the mining machine into the number 2 entry.\u00a0 A. Mumau and Trimble trammed the roof bolting machine from the number 3 entry to the number 4 entry. \u00a0They began installing roof bolts in the number 4 entry while Frantz mined 10 feet from the face of number 2 entry.\nFrantz finished mining in number 2 entry and trammed the mining machine into the number 3 entry to trim bottom to build and install bridges. \u00a0A. Mumau and Trimble finished bolting the number 4 entry and trammed the roof bolting machine from the number 4 entry into the number 2 entry (see Appendix B).In the number 2 entry, A. Mumau and Trimble installed one row of roof bolts as the primary roof supports and one row of cable bolts as supplemental roof supports.\u00a0 There was approximately 10 feet between the last full row of bolts and the face in the number 2 entry. \u00a0A. Mumau trammed the roof bolting machine inby and positioned the ATRS with the inby edge of the ATRS pads 5 feet inby the last full row of roof supports.At approximately 2:05 p.m., Trimble was positioned between the roof bolting machine drill mast and the ATRS. \u00a0Witnesses stated that Trimble was attaching support wire to the previously installed wire roof screen and the piece of wire roof screen that would be installed. \u00a0A large piece of roof rock that measured 0.25 to 1.3 feet in thickness, 3 feet in width, and 11.5 feet in length, fell from the roof. \u00a0The rock fell in such a manner that the ATRS could not prevent the rock from hitting Trimble. \u00a0The edge of the rock closest to Trimble struck and pinned him in an upright position against the roof bolting machine drill canopy.A. Mumau was operating the left side of the roof bolting machine.\u00a0 He was looking toward the rear of the machine to ensure that the rear was not dragging on the bottom when he heard the rock fall.\u00a0 A. Mumau turned around to find Trimble pinned by a rock against the drill canopy. \u00a0A. Mumua rushed outby shouting for help.\u00a0 J. Mumau and scoop operators Paul Polenik and Cody Engle were loading a bridge conveyor onto a scoop just outby the last open crosscut in the number 2 entry.\u00a0J. Mumau went to the roof bolting machine and returned to the last open crosscut to tell Polenik and Engle to not go to the accident scene because of the extent of the victim\u2019s injuries.\u00a0 He also instructed Engle to go to the intake entry and notify Barry Houser, Mine Foreman, about the accident. \u00a0Jeremiah Blake, Utility Man, was helping Frantz hang the continuous mining machine trailing cable in the number 4 entry when they heard shouting.\u00a0 They went to the number 2 entry, where J. Mumau stopped them and told them to go to the intake with the rest of the crew.Engle placed the call to the surface. \u00a0Paul Sieczkowski, Mine Clerk, received the call and told Houser that a man was hit by a rock. \u00a0Houser took the phone and asked about the extent of Trimble\u2019s injuries.\u00a0 Cody responded that he believed Trimble was dead. \u00a0Houser told Sieczkowski to notify MSHA and the State. \u00a0Thomas (Sammy) Bassaro, Mine Examiner, had completed his preshift examination and was on the surface. \u00a0He followed Houser to the section on a mantrip.Justin Rebuck, Second Shift Section Foreman, arrived on the section.\u00a0 J. Mumau told him about the accident. \u00a0Houser arrived, went to the accident scene, and walked outby to tell Bassaro to get a hydraulic pump jack from his mantrip. \u00a0Bassaro returned and gave the pump jack to Houser. \u00a0Houser boarded the roof bolting machine and set the pump jack against the roof bolting machine and the fallen rock. He used the jack to free the victim.Houser, Rebuck, and J. Mumau transported the victim to the number 4 entry. \u00a0They placed him onto a mantrip and transported him to the surface.\u00a0 Jerry L.

Mumau.A list of the persons who participated in the investigation and those who were interviewed is contained in Appendix C.DiscussionAccident Scene\u00a0\nThe accident occurred in the number 2 slope entry, approximately 170\u00a0feet inby survey station number 4794 in the A Mains section, MMU 001-0.\u00a0\u00a0The mining height at the accident scene averaged 8.3 feet and the width of the number 2 entry was 19 feet.\u00a0\u00a0The immediate mine floor consisted of gray shale, with pockets of shale bedding that were broken out forming undulations in the mine floor. \u00a0The mine ribs were in good condition, showing no signs of sloughage and consisted of shale partings throughout the mining height.The last section of wire roof screen installed was not square with the number 2 entry.\u00a0 The left side of the wire roof screen extended 20 inches inby the last row of permanent roof supports.\u00a0 The right side of the wire roof screen panel extended 52 inches inby the last row of permanent roof supports.\u00a0 Immediately outby, in the region above the roof bolting machine, steel channels with fully grouted bolts were installed where the spacing between each bolt ranged from 3.2 to 3.8 feet.\u00a0 Channels with the vertical cable bolts were positioned between the channels installed with fully grouted roof bolts.The rock that struck Trimble was found leaning against the main support of the ATRS, on the right side drill canopy and the other end on the mine floor with the inby edge approximately 5 inches outby the back edge of the ATRS.\u00a0 The placement of the rock suggests that the rock did not contact the ATRS.\u00a0 The rock measured 0.25 to 1.3 feet in thickness, 3 feet in width, and 11.5 feet in length. \u00a0The rock weighed approximately 4,400 pounds. \u00a0The rock was shaped similar to a parallelogram.The roof bolting machine had not been moved when accident investigators arrived at the scene.\u00a0 A pump jack was installed between the top of the drill canopy and the rock to free the victim.\u00a0 The piece of wire roof screen that the victim and A. Mumau were preparing to install measured 5 feet wide by 14 feet in length.Geological Conditions on the A Mains SectionOverburden at the accident site was approximately 690 feet.\u00a0 No undermining or over mining with older workings exists in the vicinity of the slope.\u00a0 The number 2 entry had been developed to the top of the Brookville Seam but had not yet reached the coal. \u00a0Weak bedding contacts are where layers of roof strata may separate from each other. \u00a0A 15 percent downward entry slope formed ledges in the roof as a result of the relatively horizontal bedding. \u00a0Because of the weak bedding contacts, as the mining cut is advanced down slope, roof stratum can peel away from other roof stratum until the roof strata is sufficiently thick enough to remain intact and not peel away.In this manner, ledges or brows are formed in the roof. \u00a0The accident site where roof bolting was being conducted was in such a transition zone as the bolting was advancing towards a ledge in the mining cut. \u00a0The mine roof where roof bolts had been installed, the mine roof was the bottom of an overlying gray shale bed. \u00a0A general lack of continuous mining machine cutting bit marks in this roof for the last 8-foot distance of roof support installation indicated that the underlying gray shale bed easily peeled away from the overlying shale bed at the contact.Inby the last installed roof support, a brow ran diagonally across the entry towards the inby right hand corner of the cut at roughly a 10\u00b0 angle to the last installed roof support.\u00a0 After the accident, the bottom exposed portion of the brow where the roof remained intact and where it was initially cut began roughly 4.5 feet from the left side rib. \u00a0The top exposed portion of the brow where it was in contact with the overlying shale bed began roughly 6 feet from the left pillar rib (see Appendix D).\u00a0 The exposed surface of the brow, in the right side half of the entry, dipped inby towards the end of the cut at roughly 55\u00b0 from horizontal, forming a roughly 2.5-foot wide exposed face that was created by the fallen rock.Roof Control Plan and Addendum at Time of Accident\nThe last fully revised and consolidated roof control plan for this mine was approved on September 18, 2013.\u00a0 A slope addendum was approved on September 17, 2014, for the procedures and precautions for development of three slopes from the lower Kittanning seam (B Seam) to the Brookville coal seam (A Seam).\u00a0 The plan permitted a maximum mining width of 20 feet and required the roof to be supported with fully-grouted roof bolts at least 48 inches long in normal mining conditions.\u00a0 The slope plan required the roof to be supported with fully-grouted roof bolts at least 72 inches long with stipulations that when encountering coal seams, bed separations, defective roof conditions, an obvious or predominant slip, or a visible clay vein fault, supplemental roof support will be installed.The maximum cut depth was limited to 20 feet in the slope plan.\u00a0 The maximum cut depth listed in the approved roof control plan was limited to 30 feet due to adverse roof conditions in the Lower Kittanning coal seam.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, the mine operator had limited the cut depth to 10 feet because of adverse roof conditions and anticipated mining into the Brookville seam.\u00a0 The Brookville seam had been mined in 2 of the 3 entries.\u00a0 At the time of the accident the mine was in compliance with all measurements and distances required by the roof control plan slope addendum.Roof Bolting Practices at this Mine\nThe primary roof supports on this section consisted of 6-foot long, fully grouted resin bolts, \u00be inches in diameter with a steel grade of \u201c60\u201d installed through a minimum T-3 channel. \u00a0The roof bolts were on a bolt pattern, with a maximum of 4 feet between bolts, a minimum of 4 bolts per row, and a maximum of 4 feet between rows. \u00a0The T-3 channel is a ribbed steel strap, 6-inch wide, up to approximately 18 feet long, that has holes through which roof bolts are installed.\u00a0Between the primary supports, the operator was installing a row of supplemental roof supports. This consisted of cable bolts, truss bolts, and extra channels.\u00a0 The operator installed the primary supports on 4 foot by 4 foot spacing, then backed the roof bolting machine up 2 feet to install the supplemental supports. \u00a0The primary and supplemental support rows consisted of 6 bolts in each row.\u00a0 The primary and the supplemental supports were spaced apart on maximum 2 foot by 4 foot spacing, with the bolts installed on ends close to the ribs and approximately 2 feet from ribs. \u00a0The sections of wire roof screen were either contacting each other or overlapped with the supports installed through the screen.Roof Bolting Machine\nThe equipment involved in the accident was a DDR-Dual Head, Mast Feed Roof\u00a0 Drill, twin head roof bolting machine, model DDR-13-B, serial number 2011019, MSHA approval number 2G -2956A-6, manufactured by J.H. Fletcher and Company. \u00a0This machine has drill station canopies equipped with vertical slider extensions and also has angle drilling capability. \u00a0The ATRS system is an \u201cL\u201d style \u201cT\u201d bar with one ATRS pad in the middle and one on each end.\u00a0 Each ATRS outer pads measured 16 inches long by 12 inches wide and the middle pad measured 18 inches long by 12 inches wide. This system was fitted with vertical extensions for the pads that measured 12 inches, and the middle extension measured 18 inches.The width of the ATRS system is manually adjustable with four pin selections on each side, each six inches apart and measured 12 feet and 2 inches at the time of the accident. The pins were located in the second slot from the outside.Testing was performed on the ATRS by AC&C.\u00a0 Although not a factor in the accident, the lack of a pre-charge in the hydraulic accumulator and the high leakage rate of the check valve increased the likelihood that the ATRS would not provide proper roof support during a roof bolting cycle longer than 20 minutes.\u00a0 A non-contributing citation was issued for this condition. \u00a0\u00a0The investigation revealed that at the time of the accident the middle extension of the ATRS beam was flipped forward in the stowed position.\u00a0 The ATRS articulated beam was positioned at a relatively flat and level area of the mine roof.\u00a0 With this roof geometry, and the outside two pads having the 12 inch extensions in place, the original middle pad could not contact the mine roof.\u00a0 Only the two outside pads were in contact with the mine roof, with approximately a 9.5-foot distance between the inside edges of the two outer pads.\u00a0 As previously stated, the rock fell between the ATRS and the last full row of roof supports and ATRS did not contact the rock that fell. \u00a0A non-contributing citation was issued for this condition.Wire Roof Screen Installation Procedure\nDuring the accident investigation interview process, it was discovered that the wire roof screen installation was not being conducted in a consistent manner by all roof bolters.\u00a0 Four of the seven roof bolters stated that they walked in front of the drill mast to install support wire and felt that it was acceptable, since they said they were under the ATRS at all times.\u00a0 However, during reenactment of the accident, it was determined, that the distance from the outby edge of the ATRS to the drill mast ranged from 18 to 22 inches.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, the right hand canopy was approximately 4.3 feet off the mine floor and the left side canopy was approximately 4.5 feet off the mine floor.\u00a0 The drill station canopies were lowered to place the wire roof screen on top of the canopies for installation.\u00a0 This practice causes the drill station canopies to not be in a position to protect the roof bolters from potential roof hazards while positioning the wire roof screen. \u00a0As a result of the investigation, the mine\u2019s roof control plan, was revised to include a safer means of installing wire roof screen.Experience and TrainingTrimble received his Pennsylvania Underground Miner Certification on March 7, 2012. \u00a0Based on records obtained from Rosebud Mining, Inc., Trimble had 3 years and 44 weeks of mining experience. \u00a0He began working at the Heilwood Mine 1 year and 12 weeks prior to the accident and worked the entire time as a roof bolter helper.On November 18, 2013, Trimble received experienced miner training at the Heilwood Mine. \u00a0Trimble received task training for the roof bolting machine for the A Mains Section, on October 29, 2014. \u00a0On February 2, 2015 Trimble received annual refresher training.\u00a0 No deficiencies for the victim\u2019s training were found.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "A root cause analysis was conducted to identify the causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \u00a0Listed below are root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions implemented to prevent a reoccurrence of the accident.Root Cause:\u00a0The mine operator failed to prevent miners from working in an area that was not adequately supported or otherwise controlled to prevent hazards from falling roof.\u00a0 The roof bolting machine operators were allowed to position themselves between the drill mast and the ATRS, with the drill station canopies lowered, while positioning the roof screen.\nCorrective Actions:\nWhen welded wire mesh is being installed in conjunction with roof bolts:\nMesh panels will be positioned on the machine only while the machine is positioned under fully supported roof,\nMesh panels will be positioned over the drill stations and secured to the machine using at least two points of contact (e.g., drill steels raised through the mesh, wire/cable ties passed through the mesh and secured through holes in the ATRS pads, or mesh clamps affixed to the ATRS bar or pads).\nIf the mesh is dislodged as the bolting machine is trammed inby or as the ATRS is raised, the machine must be trammed outby under supported roof to reposition the panel.\nIt is also acceptable to install mesh panels over fully supported roof; in this application bolt length may be less than the minimum 6 ft length minimum prescribed in #1 above.\n< >The approved Roof Control Plan was revised to provide safer wire roof screen installation procedures and ATRS procedures during slope development. \u00a0\u00a0All affected miners were trained in these procedures.ATRS procedures\nThe ATRS Raise Control lever must be engaged for 5 seconds after the ATRS pads contact the roof and the corresponding gage must be observed to ensure that a minimum set pressure of 800 to 1,100 psi is achieved.\nWhen bolting, the maximum distance between the outby edge of the ATRS pads and the last row of permanent supports shall not exceed 5 ft. \u00a0The ATRS shall not be more than 18\u201d from the center of the hole being drilled.\nThe distance from the ATRS to each rib must not exceed 5 ft. \u00a0If due to unusual conditions, the distance between the ATRS and the rib exceeds 5 ft., the bolting machine must be positioned within 5 ft. of the rib on one side to allow safe installation of one bolt on that side while the off side operator remains in a permanently supported area.\u00a0 Subsequent to bolt installation, the machine can be repositioned to complete the bolt row.\nWire roof screen installation procedures\n4. During slope development, non-tensioned cable bolts are to be considered primary support if:\nThe cable bolt is part of a complete row of four bolts spaced no more than 30\u201d beyond the 6 ft. primary row of bolts and,\nThe next row is the primary row of bolts.\n\n"}}, "/data-reports/fatality-reports/2015/fatality-1-january-28-2015": {"report-url": "https://www.msha.gov/data-reports/fatality-reports/2015/fatality-1-january-28-2015", "accidnet-classification": "Machinery", "location": "Brubaker Mine, Pennsylvania", "mine-type": "Coal", "mine-controller": "JAZ Ventures LP", "mined-mineral": "Coal (Bituminous)", "incident-date": "2015-01-28T17:48:00-05:00", "public-notice": "This posting serves to provide a public notice to employees of the mine, employees of the mining company(s), employees of independent contractors with any connection to the mine, persons with any connection to the mine, and any person with information regarding the cause or contributing factors of this accident.\nPlease provide any information to:\nRichard Gindlesperger, Lead Accident InvestigatorPhone:\u00a0814.266.0008\n", "preliminary-report": "On January 28, 2015, at approximately 6:30 p.m., a 43 year old mine operator received fatal crushing injuries when he was pinned between the remote control continuous-miner conveyor boom and the right rib in the No. 5 Entry 55 feet inby survey station No. 2035 of the Lebeau Mains 001 MMU.

Non-Fatal Days Lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for the mine in 2014 was 6.73, compared to an NFDL rate of 3.27 for mines of this type.", "DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On January 28, 2015, Rick Kline (victim) began the afternoon shift at approximately 2:30 p.m. with the rest of the Lebeau Mains production crew. \u00a0The production crew consisted of Jamie Houston, Corey Marcum, Joseph Lubniewski, Shane Kennedy, Roof Bolters; Korey Harbaugh, Austin Matsko, Shuttle Car Operators; Dave Sipes, Scoop Operator; Eugene Horner, Mechanic; Troy Kunrod, Section Foreman, and Kline, who was the only continuous mining machine operator. \u00a0All of the production crew members except Horner, traveled to the section at the start of the shift. \u00a0Horner arrived on the section later than the other crew members. \u00a0Kline operated the continuous mining machine and mined the No. 3 entry, mined a crosscut from No. 3 entry to No. 2 entry, and mined the No. 2 and No. 7 entries.\u00a0 After the No. 7 entry was mined, Kline moved the mining machine to the No.6 entry to load the rock that fell in the face area. \u00a0Houston and Marcum finished bolting the No. 5 entry and then backed the roof bolting machine into the last open crosscut from the No. 5 entry to No. 6 entry, and waited for Kline to back the mining machine out of the No. 6 entry (see Appendix A).Kline finished loading the rock and then began moving the mining machine from the No. 6 entry to the No. 5 entry.\u00a0 He trammed the mining machine in reverse outby the last open crosscut in the No. 6 entry, continuing through the next to last open crosscut, and then just outby this crosscut in the No. 5 entry. \u00a0From that point he trammed the mining machine forward towards the face of the No. 5 entry.When he passed the last open crosscut, Kunrod, Houston, and Marcum were behind the ventilation curtain in the crosscut discussing where the roof bolters were going to bolt next.\u00a0 They could not see Kline or the mining machine through the ventilation curtain, but they heard the mining machine\u2019s scrubber fan start as the mining machine was trammed in the No. 5 entry. \u00a0Matsko trammed the No. 4 shuttle car through the last open crosscut from No. 4 entry to No. 5 entry and stopped at the No. 5 entry.While pausing, Matsko heard the scrubber fan running and saw the mining machine\u2019s trailing cable and water line moving inby.\u00a0 When he observed the trailing cable and waterline stopped moving, Matsko went to the mining machine and saw Kline pinned between the conveyor boom of the mining machine and the coal rib.\u00a0 Kline was facing inby (towards the No. 5 face) with the conveyor boom against the left side of his chest and his right side was against the coal rib. \u00a0The mining machine and scrubber fan were running and the nylon sling (rope) around the trailing cable and water line was attached to the conveyor boom.Matsko reached under the conveyor boom and retrieved the remote control box for the mining machine and swung the conveyor boom away to free Kline, turned off the mining machine, and then yelled for Kunrod. \u00a0Kunrod, a certified emergency medical technician (EMT), traveled to the accident scene with Houston (EMT) and Marcum. \u00a0Kunrod began administering first aid and told Marcum to call 911 and get the backboard and first aid supplies. \u00a0Houston assisted Kunrod and began an initial assessment, but could not confirm vital signs. \u00a0Marcum told Harbaugh to call outside to tell Colt Kniss, Outside Man, to call 911.\u00a0 Marcum obtained the first aid supplies and the backboard and took them to the accident scene. \u00a0Harbaugh got the mantrip and backed it up to the continuous mining machine. \u00a0Kline was placed on a backboard and was given oxygen.\u00a0 The automated external defibrillator (AED) was not used because Kline had a pacemaker.\u00a0 He was placed on the mantrip and first aid was administered while he was transported to the surface. \u00a0Northern EMS ambulance service and crew members took over first aid care and transported Kline to the Windber Hospital Emergency Room.\u00a0 At 7:45 p.m., Kline was pronounced dead by Somerset County Coroner, Wallace Miller, due to blunt force trauma to the chest.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On January 28, 2015, at 7:47 p.m., James Mullen, Superintendent/Mine Foreman notified MSHA that an accident had occurred at the mine. \u00a0A citation, that did not contribute to the accident, was issued for a violation of 30 CFR \u00a7 50.10 because the mine operator did not notify MSHA immediately, at once, without delay, and within 15 minutes.\u00a0 Ron Hixson, MSHA District 2 Assistant District Manager, called Dennis Zeanchock, MSHA Johnstown, Pennsylvania Field Office Supervisor, at approximately 7:50 p.m.\u00a0 Zeanchock contacted Dan Gonos, Brubaker Mine Safety Supervisor, and verbally issued a 103(j) order to preserve the accident scene and to prevent the destruction of evidence.Zeanchock then dispatched three MSHA inspectors from the Johnstown field office to begin an accident investigation. \u00a0MSHA personnel arrived at the mine at 9:30 p.m. and modified the 103(j) order to a 103(k) order at 9:35 p.m. \u00a0The accident investigation was conducted in cooperation with the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mine Safety and the mine operator.\u00a0 Persons who participated in the investigation are listed in Appendix B. \u00a0Interviews were conducted with ten miners on January 28, 2015, on the surface of the mine, and with four additional miners on February 10, 2015, at the LCT Energy, LP office (see list of persons interviewed in Appendix B). \u00a0Preliminary information was collected, including measurements, photographs, and sketches that were made at the accident scene. \u00a0The functions and operations of the continuous mining machine were tested at the accident scene and a permissibility inspection was conducted on the mining machine. \u00a0The remote control unit and its battery were obtained for examination and tested under laboratory conditions at the Matric facility in Seneca, Pennsylvania.", "DISCUSSION": "Accident Scene\u00a0\nThe accident occurred in the face area in the No. 5 entry approximately 80 feet inby survey spad No. 2035 in the Lebeau Mains section (MMU 001-0). \u00a0This entry was mined 82 feet inby the last open crosscut.\u00a0 The entry was approximately 19 feet and 5 inches in width and 50 inches in height. \u00a0The roof had permanent roof support installed to the face and no hazardous conditions were observed in the roof and ribs in the area. \u00a0The mine roof, ribs, and mine floor were relatively dry.When the investigators arrived to begin the operation and function tests on the continuous mining machine, it was in the same position that it was in at the time of the accident, except that the conveyor boom was in the position that Matsko placed it when he moved it to free Kline. The front right corner of the mining machine was 88 inches outby the face and 35 inches from the right rib facing inby. \u00a0The cable anchor point located on the right rear of the mining machine when measured was 7 inches from the right rib. \u00a0There was a 5 to 6 foot loop of slack trailing cable and water line along the right rear corner of the mining machine.\u00a0 The gathering head (pan) of the mining machine was found in the raised position. \u00a0The imprints of the mining machine tracks found on the mine floor extended 5 to 6 feet in front of where the front edge of the tracks were located.\u00a0 From all indications, the continuous mining machine was being backed away from the face at the time of the accident.During on site testing, when the continuous mining machine was trammed forward a few feet from its location at the time of the accident, and then trammed back, investigators observed that the mine floor was uneven under the mining machine.\u00a0 The uneven mine floor caused the front and back of the mining machine to rock up and down.\u00a0 At this point, when investigators operated the tracks in opposite directions, the mining machine pivoted and turned very easily and very quickly.Equipment\nThe remote controlled continuous mining machine involved in the accident was manufactured by Joy Global Inc.\u00a0 The model number is 14CM09-11AX, the serial number is JM6803, MSHA approval number 2G\u20134159A\u201300, and the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mine Safety approval number is BFE-0031-08. \u00a0The remote control unit being used at the time of the accident was manufactured by Matric Ltd.\u00a0 The part number is 100510082, serial number is 172205AP019, and the MSHA approval number is 2G-4096-0.During functional operation testing of the continuous mining machine performed on January 29, 2015, the stabilizer jack was inoperable.\u00a0 The stabilizer jack is used to raise the back of the mining machine up and /or to stabilize the mining machine during the process of mining. \u00a0\u00a0Also, the conveyor gathering head had no float function, unless the selector switch on the remote was held continuously to activate the solenoid on the valve bank.\u00a0 These conditions existed because\u00a0the mine operator changed the configuration of the valve bank wiring and hydraulic hosing.\u00a0 A noncontributing citation was issued for these conditions.All of the other functions tested during the functional operation testing of the continuous mining machine operated properly.On February 5, 2015, accident investigators inspected the permissibility of the continuous mining machine.\u00a0 The right headlight lens was broken and the guard protecting it was missing two bolts. \u00a0All of the lights were working. \u00a0Illumination in the area was not a contributing factor to the accident.\u00a0 No reflective tape was on the rear of the continuous mining machine.\u00a0 A red reflector measuring 3 \u00bd inches by 2 inches, and yellow reflective tape measuring 1 \u00be inch by 2 \u00bc inch located on the right side of the conveyor boom, were approximately 5 feet from the rear of the continuous miner.\u00a0 A noncontributing citation was issued for these conditions.The remote control unit to operate the mining machine was the only unit present on the Lebeau Mains section (MMU 001-0). \u00a0This remote has a unique identification code that is paired with the continuous mining machine to eliminate the possibility of cross activation by other radio frequencies.\u00a0 The remote control unit testing and examination was done at the Matric facility in Seneca, PA.\u00a0 The MSHA Approval and Certification Center (A&CC) participated in this testing.\u00a0 Testing at Matric Ltd. did not reveal any performance deficiencies with the unit.Examinations\nThe preshift examination was conducted and no hazardous conditions were recorded.\u00a0 Kunrod performed an inadequate on-shift examination on the shift that the accident occurred.\u00a0 Kunrod stated that no hazards existed, however, investigators found significant ventilation (improper air flow), rock dust (total incombustible content), and loose rib hazards.\u00a0 A 104(d) citation and 104(d) order were issued for these violations which were noncontributory to the accident.Training and Experience\nKline had 9 years and 1 week of underground mining experience, with 4 years and 9 weeks as a continuous mining machine operator, and 23 weeks of experience at this mine. \u00a0Kline had a miner\u2019s certificate of Qualification and Machine Operator\u2019s Certificate from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.The mine operator could not produce records of Underground Experienced Miner Training.\u00a0 Also, the mine operator had no records of Task Training for the miners.\u00a0 Noncontributory citations were issued to the mine operator.During interviews, Gonos stated that the experienced miner training for the victim was never documented.\u00a0 Rick Huff, Midnight Shift Section Foreman, stated that task training records were stored on the working section on the section power center with other records.\u00a0 Huff stated that the training records got wet and were discarded.\nHuff stated that he task trained Kline on the Joy 14CM continuous mining machine, but then admitted that he didn\u2019t know if he had even been trained on a Joy 14CM mining machine himself.\u00a0 Management was aware that Kline was not trained by a qualified trainer, or a supervisor experienced in the assigned tasks, or other person experienced in the assigned tasks as required by 30 CFR \u00a7 48.7(e).\u00a0 However, Huff stated that he discussed the hazards of red zones with Kline.\u00a0 Although the victim was an experienced continuous mining machine operator, a noncontributory citation was issued to the mine operator for task training.Roof Control Plan\nThe approved roof control plan in effect at the time of the accident contains the following statement\u00a0on page 15, under the heading \u201cSafety Precautions for Operating Remote Control Continuous Mining Machine and ATRS Roof Bolter using Haulage or Shuttle Cars.\u201d \u00a0During mining and the place changing with remote-control miners, no person shall position themselves where they can be contacted by the miner during the mining or tramming process.The intent is to prevent the hazardous exposure of all persons in the working place from dangers associated with roof hazards and the movement of mining equipment.Kline positioned himself where he was contacted by the continuous mining machine that he was tramming with a remote-control unit. \u00a0The mine operator\u2019s administrative controls, policies, and training in place at the time of the accident were not adequate to ensure that the safety precautions in the approved roof control plan were being followed.\u00a0 The mine operator also had no commercially available proximity detection systems installed on the continuous mining machines being used at the mine.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "An analysis was conducted to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 During the analysis, root causes were identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.\u00a0\nListed below are root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions implemented to prevent a recurrence of the accident:Root Cause: The provisions of the approved roof control plan to prevent the hazards associated with the movement of mining equipmentwere not followed.\nCorrective Action: The mine operator has implemented the following written procedures:\nNo one will walk in close proximity of the continuous mining machine when tramming.\nThe continuous mining machine pump motor will be de-energized when loading or unloading\u00a0miner cable.\nA spotter will be used to assist the mining machine operator to move the continuous mining machine from place to place, setting up to mine coal and moving into and out of the cut.\nWhen tramming the continuous mining machine into a fresh cut, with the assistance of a spotter, the operator will tram the machine in on the left side of the cut, de-energize the machine, drop the cable and set the mining machine up to begin mining as required on the air side.\nThe company established a written plan to install the Strata proximity detection system on all the continuous mining machines the company currently owns beginning with the mining machine involved in this accident. \u00a0All miners will receive proper training on the proximity system, prior to their exposure to the system.", "CONCLUSION": "\u00a0The continuous mining machine operator received fatal crushing injuries when he was caught between the continuous mining machine and the coal rib. \u00a0The accident occurred because the victim operated (trammed) the machine, while located between the right side of the conveyor boom and the coal rib, in violation of the approved roof control plan.\u00a0 The mine operator\u2019s administrative controls, training, and policies in place at the time of the accident were not adequate to prevent the practice of operating continuous mining machines from an unsafe location. \u00a0Approved By:\n_________________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 _________________\u00a0\nThomas E.

Stormant, Heavy Equipment Operator, age 57, was seriously injured on January 26, 2015.\u00a0 Stormant was operating an excavator near a water-filled ditch when the excavator tipped on its side and entered the murky water, trapping him inside the nearly submerged cab. \u00a0Rescuers removed Stormant from the water-filled cab.\u00a0 Stormant was transported to a hospital where he died later that day.\nThree days prior to the accident several inches of rain fell in the area, causing the ditch to fill with water and overflow.\u00a0 This water covered the ditch making it invisible to persons working in the area.\u00a0 Stormant was operating the excavator near this ditch when the accident occurred.\u00a0The accident occurred due to management\u2019s failure to ensure that procedures were established to ensure miners could safely prepare a work area in advance of a dragline.\u00a0 Management failed to ensure competent persons were properly conducting workplace examinations.\u00a0 The water-filled ditch was not identified as a hazard after the heavy rainfall and management failed to barricade or place warning signs to warn employees of hazards, such as the water-filled ditch, that were not immediately obvious to miners.\u00a0", "GENERAL INFORMATION": "Swift Creek Mine, a surface phosphate mine owned and operated by PCS Phosphate-White Springs, is located in Jasper, Hamilton County, Florida.\u00a0 The principal operating official is Paul Dekok, President.\u00a0 The mine currently operates two, 12 hour shifts, five days per week, and weekends as needed. \u00a0Total employment is 188 persons.Large draglines strip varying depths of overburden above phosphate ore reserves beneath the surface.\u00a0 A dragline support crew prepares the work area in advance of the dragline using two dozers and one excavator. \u00a0Draglines excavate the phosphate ore which is then pumped as suspended slurry to a mill where it is segregated and processed for use in the manufacture of liquid and granular fertilizer products.\u00a0 Reject material is pumped from the mill through slurry pipes and used in reclamation projects.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed its last regular inspection at this operation on December 11, 2014.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On the day of the accident, January 26, 2015, William Stormant (victim) reported to work at approximately 7:00 a.m., his normal starting time.\u00a0 Before work began Stormant discussed how they were going to reduce the flooding in the immediate area with a coworker, Donnie Cray, Heavy Equipment Operator. They discussed excavating drainage ditches and removing debris to allow water to drain to reduce the impact of the flooding.Stormant started working at the cut 67 for the #4 dragline, #4 mine area. \u00a0The Old Hooker Bay Perimeter Ditch located in this area was approximately 6 to 7 feet deep and 12 to 15 feet wide and had been filled and covered by murky water from the recent heavy rains.\u00a0 In addition to Stormant and D. Cray, Kenneth Burnett, Heavy Equipment Operator, worked in the same area, also providing support for the #4 dragline.\u00a0 A float crew was working in the area as well, bolting pipe together. \u00a0D. Cray and Burnett were operating Caterpillar D8 dozers while Stormant was operating a Caterpillar 345C excavator. \u00a0Shortly before 10:00 a.m., D. Cray called Stormant on the company radio but Stormant did not answer. \u00a0At 10:01 a.m., D. Cray called Stormant on his personal cell phone to ask Stormant to come to the barge ditch to pull some muck out.\u00a0 Stormant replied that he would be there shortly.\u00a0\u00a0Cedric Cray, Heavy Equipment Operator, was on the float crew working approximately 200 yards from the accident site.\u00a0 He was operating a Caterpillar 950 C wheeled payloader, with a rake attachment, holding pipes in place to be bolted together.\u00a0 C. Cray looked to his left and saw Stormant\u2019s excavator tipping.\u00a0 C. Cray called Burnett on the company radio and told him to look towards the excavator.\u00a0 C. Cray then blew the payloader\u2019s horn to get the attention of the float crew to set the pipe down.C. Cray then drove toward the excavator.\u00a0 Burnett also drove his dozer toward the excavator.\u00a0 Burnett and C. Cray tried to connect the dozer\u2019s wench cable to the rear of the excavator.\u00a0 After several failed attempts to connect the cable, Burnett climbed onto the rear of the excavator and over the machine to reach the cab.\u00a0 D. Cray also saw the excavator tipping and drove his dozer to the accident scene.\u00a0 He waded into the water on the south side of the excavator and reached Stormant. \u00a0Stormant had removed the rear window to exit the cab but was unable to get out on his own. He was breathing but unconscious. \u00a0Burnett helped D. Cray pull Stormant from the cab and to the shore.Keith Dempsey and Kerry J. O\u2019Steen, Area Foremen, learned of the accident on the company radio and drove to the site in a company pickup truck.\u00a0 They transported Stormant in the pickup truck about five miles to the company clinic. \u00a0At 10:34 a.m., Peter Tuohey, Jr., Lab Technician, called for Emergency Medical Services. \u00a0\u00a0Michael Broshar, EMT, and Larry Robinson, Company Nurse, performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on Stormant at the clinic until an ambulance arrived at 10:50 a.m.\u00a0 The ambulance transported Stormant to a helipad. \u00a0He was then air lifted to UF Health Shands Hospital in Gainesville, Florida, where he was pronounced dead at 5:45 p.m.\u00a0 The cause of death was attributed to drowning from water submersion.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "MSHA

repairman, was fatally injured while traveling in the No. 7 entry on the No. 6 unit (MMU 067-0).\u00a0 The victim was walking across the No. 6 unit when he was struck by a coal hauler.The accident occurred because management failed to provide adequate engineering controls, administrative controls, and acceptable work practices, to protect miners from the hazards of being struck by mobile equipment.\u00a0 \u00a0", "GENERAL INFORMATION": "The Highland 9 Mine, I.D. 15-02709, is located in Waverly, Union County, Kentucky on French Road, approximately two miles west of US HWY 60. \u00a0At the time of the accident, the mine employed 474 people, of which 450 worked underground. \u00a0The mine is accessed via an intake slope. \u00a0The mine also has one intake and two return air shafts. \u00a0The mine is ventilated by two exhausting main fans, which are connected to the mine via vertical shaft openings from the coal seam to the surface. \u00a0The mine operates 3 shifts per day, 6 days a week in the KY No. 9 coal seam. \u00a0The seam averages 5\u00bd feet in height.\u00a0 The mine produces 24,000 tons per day during two ten-hour production shifts and one eight-hour maintenance shift. \u00a0The miners are represented by the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA).\u00a0\nCoal is extracted from the working faces with Joy continuous mining machines using battery-powered coal haulers and Flexible Conveyor Trains (FCT) to a conveyor belt that carries coal to the surface. \u00a0An overland conveyor belt transports the coal from the Highland 9 Mine to the Camp 9 preparation plant where it is processed and then transported by an overland conveyor belt to the Patriot Coal Company Ohio River Terminal.Although there was an ongoing inspection at the time of the accident, the last regular health and safety inspection, E01, by the Mine Safety and Health Administration was completed on September 23, 2014. \u00a0The Non-Fatal Days Lost, (NFDL) rate for this mine in 2014, was 6.49. \u00a0The NFDL rate for the Nation, for mines of this type in 2014, was 3.27.\nThe principal officers at the Highland 9 Mine at the time of the accident were:Robert Bosch...........................................President, Highland Mining Company\nLes Hawkins............................................General Mine Superintendent\nBrad Carlisle...........................................Chief Maintenance Supervisor\nRandy Duncan..........................................Safety Director\nAndy Fields..............................................Regional Safety Director, Patriot Coal Corp.", "DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT": "Eldridge started his shift on Tuesday, December 16, 2014, at approximately 7:00 a.m. at the Highland 9 Mine. \u00a0He attended the morning safety meeting conducted before miners traveled underground. \u00a0He then traveled underground at 7:15 a.m., via the slope mantrip with his regular crew. \u00a0Eldridge departed from the slope bottom at 7:24 a.m., operating a diesel service truck to the No. 6 section, arriving at the coal producing unit at 7:47 a.m. \u00a0This unit is located at the Sixth Panel South off the Third Main East.\u00a0 The remainder of the No. 6 unit crew traveled separately on a diesel mantrip to the section, arriving at 7:45 a.m.Neil Caudill, Section Foreman, conducted an examination of the work areas on the unit.\u00a0 He determined that work started by the previous shift on ventilation controls and rib support had to be completed before coal production could begin.\u00a0 Caudill assigned specific work tasks to miners. \u00a0These tasks included completing a brattice (ventilation control) at 3+20 between the No. 5 and No. 6 entries and installing rib bolts in the No. 6 entry, between crosscuts 2+40 and 3+20. \u00a0After completion of these tasks, mining on the section began in the No. 6 left entry with the No. 1 left side continuous mining machine.At approximately 8:45 a.m., Eldridge assisted Jim Courtney, Maintenance Foreman and Danny Young, Maintenance Foreman, in repairing the No. 2 continuous mining machine located on the right side of the section. \u00a0After repairs were completed, the right side continuous mining machine was moved to the No. 7 right entry.When mining was completed in No. 6 left entry with the No. 1 continuous mining machine, Eldridge and Caudill assisted Brian Looney, Left Side No. 1 Continuous Mining Machine Operator, move the machine to the No. 3 left entry. \u00a0Eldridge then changed a defective water spray nozzle in the continuous mining machine drum before leaving the area.The right side No. 2 continuous mining machine then began mining in the No. 7 right entry at approximately 10:35 a.m. Each coal hauler received a load of coal, except the No. 26 coal hauler operated by Wesley Coots. \u00a0Coots was parked in the crosscut, between the No. 6 and No. 7 entries at crosscut 4+40, waiting for the No. 27 coal hauler, operated by Patrick Baker, to travel outby before he could pull into the No. 7 entry and proceed to the continuous mining machine (See Appendix C Figure 2).While the coal haulers were waiting, Eldridge walked to the No. 29 coal hauler, operated by David Dukes, and asked if the tire had been changed. \u00a0It was learned during the investigation that this tire needed to be replaced due to torn tread. \u00a0This had been reported to Eldridge on a prior occasion. \u00a0After a brief conversation, Eldridge proceeded through the ventilation curtain and Dukes lost sight of him.\u00a0 \u00a0Eldridge stopped and sat on the off-side of the No. 26 coal hauler, to ask Coots if he had any problems or oil leaks on his coal hauler. \u00a0While Eldridge was sitting and writing notes in his book, the No. 27 coal hauler traveled back toward the dumping point. \u00a0Coots told Eldridge that he had to go get a load. \u00a0As Eldridge traveled by the battery end of the coal hauler, heading inby in the No. 7 entry, he asked Coots if he was going down (outby) the No. 7 entry. \u00a0Coots said he was. \u00a0At this point, Coots lost sight of Eldridge and pulled his coal hauler outby in the No. 7 entry. \u00a0Coots, then stopped, changed directions, and began traveling inby in the No. 7 entry with loading end first to the No. 2, right side continuous mining machine. \u00a0Coots traveled inby approximately 10 feet when he heard an unusual sound. \u00a0He immediately stopped the coal hauler using the service brakes. \u00a0Realizing that Eldridge had been struck by the coal hauler, Coots began yelling for help.\u00a0 Terry Steeley, No. 28 Coal Hauler Operator, and Dukes traveled on foot to the accident scene and saw Eldridge\u2019s leg from beneath the No. 26 coal hauler.Steeley and Coots ran to the mine phone located near the power center and Steeley called outside for help. Carlos Ewing, No. 2 Continuous Mining Machine Operator; Mike Jones, No. 1 Scoop Operator; Shawn Howard, No. 8 Roof Bolting Machine Operator; and Brian Looney arrived at the accident scene. \u00a0Dukes asked Looney to go get the section foreman and Brandon LaMond, Production Coordinator, who was already on the section as part of his normal routine. \u00a0At approximately 10:58 a.m., Howard checked Eldridge for a pulse and reported to the group that he could not detect a pulse.LaMond and Caudill arrived at the accident scene at approximately 11:05 a.m. \u00a0From observation and report of no pulse, they realized Eldridge was deceased.\u00a0 \u00a0LaMond asked Caudill and the rest of No. 6 unit miners to leave the area. \u00a0LaMond went to the mine phone to notify mine management of the accident and to have them call for EMS personnel and notify MSHA.\u00a0 At approximately 11:40 a.m. LaMond sent Coots outside with another miner to aid him. \u00a0At approximately 11:45 a.m., LaMond, Darrin Browning, Maintenance Foreman, and Young pulled Eldridge from beneath the coal hauler and placed him on a stretcher. \u00a0Eldridge was then transported out of the mine. \u00a0At 12:23 p.m. Eldridge arrived on the surface and was loaded into the awaiting ambulance.The Union County Coroner determined that the victim died instantly when the accident occurred at 10:55 a.m.\u00a0", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "At 11:09 a.m., on Tuesday, December 16, 2014, Andy Fields, Regional Safety Director, Patriot Coal Corp., notified Ron Burns, Technical Assistant District Manager, an accident had occurred at the mine property on the No. 6 unit. \u00a0Fields stated that an employee has been hit by a coal hauler and an ambulance was on the way to the mine. \u00a0Fields said he did not know the extent of his injuries. At 11:15 a.m., Burns issued a verbal 103(j) order to Fields, to insure the safety of the miners, and to preserve evidence. \u00a0Burns dispatched an investigation team to the mine.Jeff Winders, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, was underground at the mine conducting inspections at the time of the accident. \u00a0Winders was notified of the accident by mine management at approximately 11:25 a.m. \u00a0Winders traveled to the accident scene with Josh Gibson, Highland Safety Department. \u00a0After Winders arrived at the accident scene he issued a 103(k) order to Gibson, secured the accident scene, and took pictures and measurements of the accident scene. \u00a0The 103(k) order issued by Winders was later vacated because Burns had already issued the 103(j) order.\u00a0 The 103(j) order was later modified to a 103(k) order by Carlisle when he arrived at the mine.Various MSHA personnel including Bill Barnwell, Enforcement Assistant District Manager; Curtis Hardison, Field Office Supervisor; and Archie Coburn and Adam Carlisle, Accident Investigators, traveled to the mine. \u00a0Carlisle and Coburn, along with inspectors from Kentucky Division of Mine Safety (KDMS) conducted interviews with witnesses of the accident. \u00a0The investigation party was comprised of Carlisle, Coburn, Barnwell and Hardison, along with the Kentucky Office of Mine Safety personnel, the company officials, and union representatives of the miners (see Appendix A). \u00a0The investigation party traveled underground to begin the scene investigation.On Wednesday, December 17, 2014, Carlisle and Tim Fugate, Chief Accident Investigator, Kentucky Division of Mine Safety, conducted formal interviews of the witnesses at the Kentucky State Office building in Madisonville, Kentucky. \u00a0Also present during the formal interviews were representatives of Highland Mining Company, the UMWA, and Malia Holzberger, Solicitor for MSHA (see Appendix B).On December 18, 2014, Carlisle, Coburn, and Abe DeLeon, Supervisory Inspector, returned to the mine to take additional photos of the area and to recreate the accident seen.On December 21, 2014, Carlisle, Coburn, and DeLeon, returned to the mine and accompanied Dustin Hinchman and Justin A. Daniels, Engineers from MSHA Approval and Certification Center. \u00a0The group performed an equipment illumination survey and an electrical examination on the coal hauler involved in the accident.DiscussionCoal Haulage\nOn the coal producing units that utilize battery-powered coal haulers, a unique system of haulage is used to facilitate loading and minimize routes of travel. \u00a0The coal hauler operator\u2019s seat is on the battery end of the coal hauler. Typically, the coal hauler will travel in the direction of the battery end. \u00a0Each coal hauler runs in a circular route that begins at the dumping point and continues to the continuous mining machine where it is loaded with coal and then returns to the dumping point. \u00a0The coal is unloaded at the dumping point, and then carried by belt conveyor to the surface. \u00a0In this circular route of travel, the coal hauler operator must change the direction of travel prior to receiving or dumping a load of coal. \u00a0This puts the machine loading end either at the continuous mining machine to load coal or at the dumping point to unload coal. \u00a0To accomplish this task, the coal hauler operator travels through a crosscut, battery end first into the connected entry, turns and then proceeds to the continuous mining machine.\u00a0 Once loaded, the operator will tram the coal hauler to the dumping point, battery end first, into a crosscut and back into the entry with the loading/dumping end toward the dumping point (see Appendix C, Figure 1).Accident Scene\nThe accident occurred on the right side of the No. 6 unit (MMU 067-0) in the No. 7 entry, approximately 6 feet inby the inby left corner of crosscut 4+40 (see Appendix C, Figure 3). \u00a0The mine floor in the area of the accident scene had irregularities.\u00a0 This was created when the continuous mining machine cut into the mine floor when developing the right crosscut. \u00a0Although the coal height was 5\u00bd feet, the actual mining height fluctuated up to 84 inches because of loose roof, soft mine floor, and cutting by the continuous mining machine operator. \u00a0The uneven floor began in the No. 7 entry intersection at crosscut 4+40 and extended into the right crosscut toward the No. 8 entry. \u00a0This uneven floor presented itself as a very large pot hole with sloping side walls. \u00a0The hole was sloped from the left to right side in the No. 7 entry, and extended into the right crosscut. \u00a0At the location of the accident, the No. 7 entry measured 18\u2019 6\u201dwide and 7\u2019 in height.When investigators arrived at the accident scene, the No. 26 coal hauler was located in the intersection of the No. 7 entry at crosscut 4+40. \u00a0The loading end of the coal hauler was located twenty five inches from the left inby rib (see Appendix C, Figure 4). \u00a0The battery end of the coal hauler was angled toward the right outby rib corner into the hole cut in the mine floor. \u00a0The right corner of the coal hauler machine batteries were located thirteen inches from the rib corner.The investigators determined the accident occurred as the coal hauler was traveling out of the left crosscut into the No. 7 entry to align the loading end for travel to the continuous mining machine.\nThe coal haulers were traveling through the hole cut into the mine floor in the No. 7 entry intersection. \u00a0This caused the machine to tilt to the right on the operator\u2019s side, raising the left corner of the bed as the coal hauler traveled through the intersection (see Appendix D). \u00a0The elevated position of the bed contributed to the hazard and limited visibility for the coal hauler operator. \u00a0After it was determined that the coal haulers had difficulty passing through the area, further grading was performed in the area of the intersection to reduce the slope of the grade.\u00a0 No other corrections had been made to reduce the hazard of reduced visibility in the intersection.Equipment\nThe No. 26 battery-powered coal hauler involved in the accident was manufactured by Caterpillar, model number LAR816, serial number 816-1151 and had MSHA approval number 18-A060013-0. \u00a0The coal hauler was put into service at Highland 9 Mine on August 6, 2012, after being transferred from a mine in West Virginia. \u00a0The coal hauler measured 38 feet and 10 inches in length, 12 feet wide, and a maximum canopy height of 84 inches.Testing and Examination\nThe No. 26 coal hauler was examined by the investigation team and functional tests of the braking and steering systems were performed at the accident scene. \u00a0No operational irregularities or deficiencies were observed or detected during the functional testing.Strobe Light\nInformation obtained during the accident investigation revealed that the victim had a personal strobe light. \u00a0The strobe light was attached to the front lower portion of his belt suspenders. \u00a0The interviews indicated that the victim did not have his strobe light turned on at the time of the accident. \u00a0The strobe light worked properly when it was tested. \u00a0During the investigation, it was determined that the location of the victim\u2019s strobe light would have been ineffective to warn the coal hauler operator due to the raised position of the bed when the victim was struck.Previous Accident\nThis fatal accident involving the No. 26 coal hauler is the second serious accident, and the first fatality, where a battery-powered coal hauler was being operated on an active mining section at the Highland 9 Mine. \u00a0The first injury accident occurred on December 5, 2013, when a miner, while walking beside a de-energized coal hauler, walked through a ventilation curtain where the coal hauler was parked beneath the curtain. \u00a0Not realizing that the miner on foot had not cleared the coal hauler, the coal hauler operator started the coal hauler and engaged the steering, which pinned the miner between the machine\u2019s bed and coal rib, breaking his leg.Training and Experience\nEldridge had 15 years of underground mining experience. \u00a0Eldridge received his Kentucky underground mining card on July 8, 1999. \u00a0He received his Kentucky underground mine foreman certification on October 28, 2010. \u00a0He had also received his electrical worker certification from the State of Kentucky. \u00a0A non-contributory citation was issued to the mine for not having a record showing that Eldridge had received task training as a unit repairman. \u00a0An examination of the company training records indicated Eldridge last received the required 8-hour annual refresher training for underground miners on November 18, 2014. \u00a0Eldridge had been employed at the Highland No. 9 mine for 35 weeks. \u00a0He received his mine specific training on March 17, 2014.Coots earned his underground miners certification on September 21, 2004. \u00a0He had 8 years of underground mining experience at the time of the accident. \u00a0Coots began his employment at Highland Mine on December 16, 2013, and received his mine specific training December 16, 2013. \u00a0Coots\u2019 received annual refresher training for underground miners on November 11, 2014.The investigation revealed that the mine had no record of the required task training on the safe operation of the coal hauler. \u00a0After questioning Coots, the section foreman, and other miners on the section, it was determined that Coots had been task trained properly on the coal hauler and had demonstrated that he could operate that piece of equipment safely. \u00a0Coots had been the operator of a coal hauler for approximately 2 months on this section, at the time of the accident. \u00a0Coots had previous coal hauler and shuttle car operating experience on other sections at Highland 9 Mine as well as at other coal mines.\u00a0 A citation was issued for the mine operator not having a record of task training for Coots. \u00a0Also, a citation was issued to the mine operator for seven other miners assigned to the section for not having a record of task training.\u00a0 These citations were considered non-contributory to the accident.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "An analysis was conducted to identify the underlying cause or causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls. \u00a0Listed below are the root causes identified during the analysis and the corrective actions implemented to prevent recurrence of the accident.Root Cause: The mine operator did not have effective engineering controls, policies, programs, or procedures to protect miners on the working section from the hazards of being struck by battery-powered coal haulers and the mine operator had not trained the miners on engineering controls, policies, or procedures.Corrective Actions:\u00a0Commercially available and permissible engineering controls, such as proximity detection devices, cameras, or other engineering controls, will be installed on the coal haulers to protect the miner from the hazards of battery-powered haulage equipment operating on the working sections.\u00a0 The miners will be trained on the installed engineering controls.Root Cause: The mine operator did not have effective policies, programs, or procedures that assure all miners properly utilize the personal strobe light issued to the miners and that the miners were trained.Corrective Actions:\u00a0All miners will be provided a personal strobe light. \u00a0The strobe lights shall be worn when traveling by foot inby the loading point on all working sections. \u00a0The strobe light shall be positioned on the rear of the miners\u2019 hard hat or the upper third of the miners back to ensure maximum visibility. \u00a0The strobe lights shall be turned on while miners are traveling by foot inby the tail piece and shall be properly maintained at all times. \u00a0All miners were trained on the use of personal strobe lights.Root Cause: \u00a0The mine operator did not have effective policies, programs, or procedures that assure all miners on the working section had an effective means to communicate their presence on the unit, intended activities, and routes of travel and that the miners were trained.Corrective Actions:\u00a0The mine operator provided all miners working or traveling inby the loading point\u00a0with two-way radiosto use to communicate their presence on the unit, their intended activities, and route of travel.\u00a0 All miners were trained in the use of the two-way radios.Root Cause:\u00a0The mine operator did not have effective policies, programs, or procedures that assure all miners on the working section operating mobile equipment adequately communicated to other miners their intentions to move the equipment or change direction of travel and that the miners were trained.Corrective Actions:The mine operator has instituted a policy that all rubber-tired equipment operators on the working section shall sound an audible warning device before tramming the equipment in any direction. \u00a0All affected miners were trained on the use of the audible warning devices established by the mine operator for use.\u00a0", "CONCLUSION": "The accident occurred because the mine operator failed to provide adequate engineering controls, administrative controls, and acceptable work practices to protect miners from the hazards of being struck by mobile equipment.In addition, the mine operator failed to maintain the condition of the mine floor free of preventable bottom irregularities. \u00a0The bottom irregularities present in the intersection of the No. 7 entry greatly reduced the coal hauler operator\u2019s field of view, until the coal hauler was clear of the bottom irregularities.\u00a0Approved

Glover, Contract Truck Driver, age 46, was killed while operating an articulated haul truck.\u00a0 Glover was traveling along the main quarry haul road and failed to negotiate a curve in the road.\u00a0 The truck traveled over a berm and went into a large pond. \u00a0Glover drowned in the accident and a rescue diver extricated him from the truck.The accident occurred due to contractor management\u2019s failure to ensure that the victim maintained control of the truck he was operating at all times.\u00a0 An inspection of the truck did not identify any defects and the haul road and berms were in good condition. \u00a0Glover was not wearing a seat belt.", "GENERAL INFORMATION": "Millersville Quarry, a surface crushed limestone operation owned and operated by MGQ Aggregates Incorporated, is located in Helena, Sandusky County, Ohio.\u00a0 The principal operating official is Lynn Radabaugh, President.\u00a0 The mine operates one 8-hour shift per day, five days per week.\u00a0 Total employment is eight persons.A surface lime facility, owned and operated by Carmeuse Lime Inc., is located on the same property.\u00a0 The two operations are physically separated by Ohio State Route 635; however, they are connected by a 1.5-mile long main quarry haul road (see Figure 1).\u00a0 Ponds are located to the north and south of this haul road with water depths ranging up to 45 feet deep.At the Millersville Quarry, limestone is drilled and blasted from a multiple-bench quarry.\u00a0 An excavator is used to feed the broken limestone into portable plants for crushing and sizing.\u00a0 A front-end loader is used to load the material into haul trucks for transport to Carmeuse Lime Inc.\u2019s plant for further processing.\u00a0 The limestone is heated in kilns and further reduced to produce hydrated lime.\u00a0 The final product is sold for use in the agricultural and cement industries.\u00a0Mark\u2019s Excavating & Trucking, owned and operated by Mark Schaffer, President, is located in Norwalk, Huron County, Ohio.\u00a0 The company is contracted by MGQ Aggregates Incorporated to perform stripping operations prior to mining in the quarry.\u00a0 Eleven persons work at the mine on one 8-hour shift, five days per week.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this mine on April 23, 2014.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On December 1, 2014, Darwin O. Glover (victim) reported for work at 6:30 a.m., his normal starting time.\u00a0 Timothy Knoll, Supervisor, instructed Glover to operate an articulated haul truck to transport overburden from the quarry to a reclamation area at Carmeuse Lime Inc.\u2019s facility.\u00a0 Glover began hauling and dumping successive loads of material as instructed.\u00a0 At about 10:30\u00a0a.m., Glover dumped a load of overburden at the dump site and was returning to the stripping operation. \u00a0After making a 90-degree turn, Glover crossed State Route 635 to access the main quarry haul road.\u00a0 He drove eastward approximately 454 feet down a grade of 5\u00a0percent and onto a level area where the road turned approximately 36 degrees to the south. \u00a0In this area, ponds were located on each side of the haul road.\u00a0 Jeremy Briggs, Quarry Superintendent, was traveling in the opposite direction.\u00a0 Briggs noticed Glover\u2019s truck was traveling faster than normal speed and crossing over into his lane.\u00a0 Briggs realized that Glover was not going to negotiate the curve.Glover\u2019s truck did not follow the turn but traveled straight approximately 213 feet and impacted the northern berm at a 21-degree angle.\u00a0 The truck then straddled the berm and skidded for approximately 64 feet before the right side wheels rode up and over the berm and the truck entered the pond.Briggs drove his haul truck to the pond and saw the submerged cab of Glover\u2019s truck.\u00a0 Briggs immediately radioed for help and then called 9\u20111-1 for emergency assistance.\u00a0 At 10:55 a.m., local fire and water rescue services arrived at the site.\u00a0 A rescue diver entered the pond and extricated Glover from the fully submerged truck.\u00a0 Emergency medical services arrived and transported Glover to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.\u00a0 The cause of death was attributed to drowning.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "MSHA was notified of the accident at 11:42 a.m. on December 1, 2014, by a telephone call from Jeremy Briggs, Quarry Superintendent, to the National Call Center.\u00a0 The National Call Center notified Joseph M. Denk, Staff Assistant, and an investigation was started the same day.\u00a0 An order was issued under provisions of Section 103(j) of the Mine Act.\u00a0 This order was later modified to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act after the arrival of an Authorized Representative at the mine site.\u00a0 Part 50 citations were issued to Mark\u2019s Excavating & Trucking and MGQ Aggregates Incorporated, for untimely reporting.MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident.\u00a0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine and contractor management and employees and local law enforcement.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred on the main quarry haul road approximately 960 feet from State Route 635 near a 36-degree curve to the south in the haul road.\u00a0 The victim\u2019s truck was traveling from west to east.\u00a0 Substantial berms are constructed on both sides along the length of the haul road.\u00a0 The haul road is smooth, consisting of hard-packed limestone, and is approximately 40\u00a0feet wide between the berms.\u00a0 The posted speed limit at the mine and on the main quarry haul road is 25\u00a0mph.The berms consist primarily of limestone rocks ranging in size from 3 inches to 8\u00a0inches.\u00a0 The berm height in the area where the truck ran over the berm is approximately 66 inches above the adjacent roadway with a base approximately 17 feet between the roadway and pond.\u00a0 Tire tracks on the berm indicate the left front tire impacted the berm at an angle of approximately 21\u00a0degrees.\u00a0 As the result of trucks traveling the road and periodic grading, fine limestone dust had accumulated over time between the base of the berms and the haul road.\u00a0 This created an approximately 30\u2011inch wide and 16-inch high ramp up onto the berms.Equipment InvolvedGeneral Information:\u00a0The truck involved in the accident is a 2004 Caterpillar Model 725 Articulated Haul Truck consisting of a tractor unit and a trailer unit.\u00a0 The truck is approximately 32-feet long, 9-feet wide, and 11-feet high and is powered by a 6-cylinder, turbocharged diesel engine.\u00a0 The transmission has six forward speeds and one reverse speed.\u00a0 The operator selects the gear using a shift lever in the operator\u2019s compartment.\u00a0 The transmission has an integral hydraulic retarder activated by a lever on the right side of the steering column.\u00a0 The truck has six-wheel drive, with one axle on the tractor unit and two axles on the trailer.\u00a0 The truck\u2019s rated load capacity is 26 tons and its approximate gross vehicle weight is 51 tons.\u00a0 Caterpillar specifications for the truck indicate a top speed of 32.1\u00a0mph in sixth gear.\nTruck Conditions Found:\u00a0The truck sustained minor damage due to the accident.\u00a0 Water entered the engine, transmission, and hydraulic systems.\u00a0 The front windshield was broken and the fiberglass cowling behind the operator\u2019s compartment was cracked and had pieces broken off.\u00a0 The front skid plate was bent up and the adjacent engine exhaust pipe was bent in and had approximately a \u215c-inch hole in the pipe in this area.\n\tThe positions of the operator\u2019s controls were observed and the engine start switch (key) was in the \u201con\u201d (run) position. The transmission selector lever was in the \u201c1\u201d position.\u00a0 The retarder lever was in the disengaged (off) position.\u00a0 The parking brake was in the pushed-in, disengaged (off) position.\u00a0 The control positions may have been affected during the accident or recovery from the pond.\u00a0\n\tThe machine was equipped with 23.5R25 radial tires.\u00a0 The rolling radius of the tires, with the truck unloaded, was approximately 28.75 inches and the tread width was approximately 22\u00a0inches.\u00a0 The tires were found to be in good to fair condition.\u00a0\n\tNo significant debris or extraneous items were found in the operator\u2019s compartment that would have interfered with the truck\u2019s operation.\u00a0 The steering wheel, accelerator, and brake pedal were operated by hand without difficulty.\nEvent (Fault) Codes at the Time of Accident:\u00a0 Although the batteries were dead, the truck\u2019s Electronic Control Modules (ECMs) and electrical circuits operated properly after the truck was re-powered.\u00a0 Data from the truck\u2019s ECMs were downloaded and the ECM time was recorded in hour increments.\u00a0 The only code possibly related to the accident was for a \u201cLow Steering Pump Pressure\u201d event at transmission hour reading 6032 hours which corresponded to the engine hour reading of 6070 hours.\u00a0 Since numerous other event codes occurred at the same time, this is considered to be the time of the vehicle entered the water.\u00a0 The investigators concluded that the low steering pressure event occurred as a result of the truck entering the water.\nPre-operational Examinations and Maintenance:\u00a0 Examination and Maintenance records, dating from August\u00a013, 2005, were available and reviewed.\u00a0 In 2014, no pre-operational examination records indicated any problems with the truck.\u00a0 The only steering and braking system defects previously noted were for the parking brake system (in 2013) and steering system (in 2008, 2012, and 2013) low pressure switches.\u00a0 The investigators concluded that these defects did not represent a recurring problem and were not contributing factors in the accident.\n\tThe hydraulic filters for the hydraulic (braking and steering) system were removed and inspected.\u00a0 No significant accumulation of debris was observed on the filters.\u00a0 Maintenance records indicated that the filters had been changed approximately four months prior to the accident.\nRepairs Made to Allow Testing:\u00a0 After the truck was recovered from the water, it was hauled to the contractor\u2019s main shop in Norwalk, Ohio.\u00a0 The truck\u2019s engine, transmission, and hydraulic systems were drained to remove water and fluids.\u00a0 After new filters were installed and necessary fluids replaced, the engine was restarted to conduct operational testing.\nOperator Controls and Testing:\u00a0 The gear shift lever, park brake control, hoist control, and the retarder lever sent correct signals to the ECM when moved through their various positions.\u00a0 The accelerator pedal appeared to properly control the engine speed after the engine was started.\u00a0 The ECM monitor for the accelerator pedal indicated that pedal\u2019s signal to the ECM moved from 0 percent to approximately 95 percent and back to 0 percent as the pedal was fully applied and then released.\u00a0 The accelerator pedal worked as designed.\nBraking Systems Design and Testing:\u00a0 The truck is equipped with a dual system, hydraulic service brake and a spring-applied, hydraulic pressure-released parking brake.\u00a0 The parking brake functions as a tertiary brake if both service braking systems fail.\u00a0 The service braking system activates dry caliper disc brakes on the tractor axle and on the first rear axle.\u00a0 Two calipers are provided on the discs at each wheel.\u00a0 The second rear axle is not designed with service brakes.\u00a0 The park brake system activates a dry caliper disc brake attached to the output drive shaft of the transmission. \u00a0The park brake acts on both of the trailer axles.\u00a0\n\tThe service and parking brake systems are supplied with hydraulic pressure from an engine driven piston pump.\u00a0 The hydraulic pressure applies service brakes when the operator activates a foot pedal in the operator\u2019s compartment. \u00a0Hydraulic pressure releases the parking brake when a control button in the operator\u2019s compartment is depressed.\u00a0 The parking brake is applied by pulling the button out.\u00a0 Both systems are provided with a hydraulic accumulator which reduces lag time in application of the service brake and release of the park brake.\n\tVisual inspection of the brake pads and rotors did not reveal any significant defects.\u00a0 After the truck was repaired (as described above) to allow operational brake testing, hydraulic fluid was observed leaking at the front right brake line block that tees in the upper and lower calipers.\u00a0 A line support clamp, approximately 18 inches from the block, was loose and allowed the line to vibrate at the block.\u00a0 The investigators concluded that the slight leak did not affect the capability of the service braking system.\n\tThe service brake holding ability was checked with the service brake applied, the transmission in first gear, and the engine speed increased to 1200 rpm and the truck did not move.\u00a0 The service brake met Caterpillar\u2019s brake holding ability specifications.\n\tAccording to Caterpillar specifications, the parking brake is to be tested on a 15 percent grade.\u00a0 Since the truck was taken to the contractor\u2019s shop, it could not be tested on a grade.\u00a0 However, when the truck was pulled from the pond, it was found with the parking brake disengaged.\u00a0 The parking brake was subsequently set to prohibit inadvertent movement while the truck was being examined.\u00a0 The investigators noted that when the truck was pulled away from the berm and loaded onto a \u2018low boy\u2019 trailer, all four rear tires skidded.\u00a0 This indicated that for an unloaded truck, as was the case prior the accident, the parking brake had the capability of stopping the truck, if necessary, in the event of an emergency.\nSteering System Design and Testing:\u00a0\u00a0The articulated truck frame steering is provided by double-acting hydraulic steering cylinders that provide 45-degree left and right steering.\u00a0 Caterpillar specifies a turning radius of 23 feet 10 inches.\u00a0 Under normal operation, the steering system is provided hydraulic pressure by a piston pump connected to the engine.\u00a0 In the case of loss of primary steering pressure, secondary steering is provided by a battery-driven hydraulic pump.\u00a0 A secondary test switch is located on the instrument panel in the operator\u2019s compartment.\u00a0 Using this switch, the secondary steering system was tested at the accident site after installing new batteries in the truck.\u00a0 The secondary steering system worked and no leaks were observed in the steering circuit.\u00a0\n\tAccording to Caterpillar specifications, a steering time test was performed with the engine at high idle while measuring the average time from steering stop to stop when rotating the steering wheel at 60 rpm.\u00a0 The average of 10 tests of the stop to stop times was approximately 4.8 seconds which met the Caterpillar specifications.\u00a0 No damage, leakage, or operational problems were noted with the steering system.\nSeat Belt:\u00a0\u00a0The seat belt latched and unlatched when tested.\nWeatherOn the day of the accident, skies were clear with an average temperature of 34\u00a0degrees Fahrenheit with calm winds.\u00a0 Sunrise was at 7:44 a.m. \u00a0The investigators determined that weather conditions and lighting were not contributing factors in the accident.SummarySubstantial berms had been constructed on both sides along the length of the entire of the main quarry haul road.\u00a0 The haul road was smooth and approximately 40 feet wide between the berms.\u00a0 The posted speed limit at the mine and on the main quarry haul road was 25 mph.\u00a0 There were no road obstructions or adverse weather conditions.\u00a0 In addition, there were no defects identified with the haul truck\u2019s braking systems, steering system, or accelerator.\u00a0 Other than excessive speed, there were no conditions present that would have restricted the ability of the driver to control the truck at the time of the accident.", "TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE": "Darwin O. Glover had 20 years of experience as a mobile equipment operator.\u00a0 Glover worked for the contractor, primarily as a truck driver, for the past 1\u00bd years, but had worked at the mine for only five days.\u00a0\nA representative of MSHA\u2019s Educational Field and Small Mine Services conducted an in-depth review of the contractor\u2019s part 46 training records for Glover. \u00a0The records documented that he had received all required training, including task training on the articulated haul truck that he was operating.\u00a0 He received site-specific hazard training through MGQ Aggregates Incorporated and Carmeuse Lime Inc.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "The investigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified the following root causes:Root Cause: \u00a0Contractor management did not ensure that the victim maintained control of the truck he was operating at all times.Corrective Action: \u00a0Contractor management established procedures to ensure that mobile equipment operators maintain control of trucks at all times while operating them.\u00a0 The procedures require that mobile equipment operators obey posted speed limits and maintain safe control of the equipment being operated.\u00a0 All contract truck drivers were trained in these new policies and procedures.Root Cause:\u00a0Contractor management policies, procedures, and controls did not ensure the victim wore his seat belt when operating the haul truck.Corrective Action:\u00a0All contract truck drivers received additional training regarding the required use of seat belts when operating haul trucks. \u00a0Management will monitor truck drivers to ensure seat belts are worn.", "CONCLUSION": "The accident occurred due to contractor management\u2019s failure to ensure that the victim maintained control of the truck he was operating at all times.\u00a0 An inspection of the truck did not identify any defects and the haul road and berms were in good condition.\u00a0 Glover was not wearing a seat belt.", "ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS": "Issued to Mark\u2019s Excavating and TruckingOrder No. 8807207\u00a0- Issued on December 1, 2014, under the provisions of Section 103(j) of the Mine

Pabian (victim) reported to the Pabian Enterprises, LLC shop in Oglesby, Illinois at 6:30 a.m., which was his normal starting time. After receiving the day\u2019s instructions from his supervisor, the victim traveled to the Ottawa Plant mine site with Bruce Patterson and Jonathon Koniecky, both maintenance/repairmen.These three men reached the mine at approximately 7:15 a.m. and met Steve Pabian, owner of Pabian Enterprises, LLC, who had driven separately. As they arrived, work began at the #7 Relay Pump Station installing an overhead electric hoist. Work progressed normally through the early morning.At approximately 11:00 a.m., Steve Pabian left the #7 Pump House to check conditions on #8 Pump House.At approximately 11:05 a.m., Koniecky was working on the overhead hoist from the top of a step ladder. Daniel Pabian bent over to retrieve a wrench on the pump house floor and then began climbing up the first couple of rungs of the same ladder to hand Koniecky the tool.\u00a0 Patterson, who was standing nearby, watched Daniel Pabian climb the ladder rungs and then fall backwards unexpectedly, as if he made no attempt to catch himself or control the fall. During the fall, Pabian struck his head on a steel guard to the water pump drive belts and sheave. He landed on the concrete pump house floor.At approximately 11:10 a.m., Patterson called Steve Pabian to inform him that Daniel Pabian had fallen. Patterson and Steve Pabian then both contacted 911 operators for emergency assistance.\u00a0 After calling 911, Steve Pabian went to the mine gate so he could direct emergency responders to the scene. Patterson relayed 911 dispatcher instructions to Koniecky so cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) could be administered.Emergency medical services arrived, continued CPR, and transported the victim to a local hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.

Crane backed the haul truck to the edge of an overburden dumpsite and started to raise the truck\u2019s bed to dump a load of material. The bank failed, causing the truck to overturn and fall 30 feet below.The accident occurred due to management\u2019s failure to ensure examinations were conducted periodically at the dumping location throughout the shift as changing conditions warranted. Management also failed to ensure that loads were dumped a safe distance back from the undercut edge of the overburden stockpile.An excavator removed material from the toe area of the overburden stockpile as material was being dumped from the haul truck at the top. Removing material from the pile steepened the slope angle from 30 to 39 degrees, creating an unstable condition at the dump site. The loaded haul truck backed very close to the edge of the overburden stockpile where the weight from the truck caused a localized failure and loss of ground under the back wheels of the loaded truck. As the rear of the truck dropped, the downward and lateral momentum caused it to flip over onto the cab, landing approximately 30 feet down the slope of the overburden stockpile.", "GENERAL INFORMATION": "South Sterling Quarry, a surface crushed sandstone operation owned and operated by Edwards Sand & Stone, is located in Greene Township, Pike County, Pennsylvania. The principal operating official is George F. Edwards Jr., President. The mine typically operates one 9 hour shift, five days per week. Total employment is 17 persons.Sandstone is drilled and blasted from a multiple-bench quarry. A front-end loader is used to load haul trucks which transport the broken sandstone to a primary plant for processing. There the material is crushed, sized, washed and sold as construction aggregates.Stripping overburden is included as part of the mining cycle at the quarry. An excavator is used to remove overburden from an elevated bench and load it into a haul truck which transports the material to an established dump site on top of an overburden stockpile. A second excavator is used on a bench located on the downstream slope of the overburden stockpile about ten feet above the toe. It removes material from the slope directly below the dump site and feeds it into a remotely-controlled mobile screening plant located near the toe. The portable plant is used to separate the material into three sizes which are placed in respective stockpiles using a front-end loader.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on October 17, 2014.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On November 25, 2014, James P. Crane (victim) reported for work at 7:00 a.m., his normal starting time. Michael R. Nebraski, Plant Manager, instructed Crane to operate a haul truck to transport material from the overburden bench to the overburden dump site. Afterward, Crane began hauling successive loads of material as instructed. At approximately 1:15 p.m., Crane hauled a load of material from the overburden bench to the top of the overburden stockpile and backed the haul truck into the dump site. At that time, Egon E. Hussman, Excavator Operator, was feeding material into the portable screening plant located at the base of the overburden stockpile. Hussman noticed Crane\u2019s haul truck was not approaching the dump point squarely. He sounded the excavator\u2019s horn and raised its bucket, attempting to stop Crane; however, Crane\u2019s truck continued to back up. The bank collapsed and Hussman turned the excavator and trammed it away from the falling haul truck.Ronald C. Heffner, Front-end Loader Operator, was stockpiling sorted material from the portable screening plant when he saw Crane\u2019s haul truck falling over the dump site. Heffner immediately radioed for assistance and parked his machine. When Hussman swung his excavator around, he saw Heffner running toward the overturned haul truck. When Heffner arrived at the truck, he found Crane attempting to crawl out of the window of the cab and helped him get out of the cab.When Mark L. Courtright, Front-end Loader Operator, heard Heffner\u2019s call for help, he radioed the mine office and asked George F. Edwards III, Asphalt Plant Manager, to call 9-1-1 for emergency assistance. Courtright drove to the overburden stockpile where he and Heffner assisted Crane until emergency medical services arrived at 1:23 p.m. At 2:24 p.m., Crane was transported by a life flight helicopter to a hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Crane died en route to the medical facility. The cause of death was attributed to multiple blunt force trauma injuries.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "MSHA was notified of the accident at 2:34 p.m. on November 25, 2014, by a telephone call from George F. Edwards Jr., President, to the National Call Center. The National Call Center notified Kevin T. Hardester, Staff Assistant, and an investigation was started the same day. An order was issued under provisions of Section 103(j) of the Mine Act. This order was later modified to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act after the arrival of an Authorized Representative at the mine site.MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident. MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, employees, and local and State law enforcement.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred at an overburden dump site. Stripping overburden is included as part of the mining cycle at the quarry (see Figure 1). An excavator is used to remove overburden from an elevated bench and load it into a haul truck on a bench below (see Figure 2). The loading area is approximately 800 feet from the established dumping location. The first 525 feet is predominantly level and the remaining 275 feet is sloped downward between 16.5 and 21.5 percent toward a dumping area (see Figure 3).As a haul truck approaches the dump site, it must turn at least 90 degrees to the right, reverse direction, back to the edge, and dump (see Figures 4 and 5). The haul truck has to back to the dump point on a radius of approximately 25 feet (as measured from tire rutting shown in Figure 5) and then begin to dump material. The immediate approach to the dump site is sloped downward approximately 1.5 percent toward the edge.A second excavator is used on a bench located on the downstream slope of the overburden stockpile about ten feet above the toe. It removes material from the slope and feeds it into a remotely-controlled mobile screening plant located near the toe (see Figure 6). The plant is used to separate the material into three sizes (cobbles, gravel, and fine soil). After separation, the materials are placed in stockpiles using a front-end loader (see Figure 7).The overburden material consists primarily of cohesive soil material. Cobbles and gravel comprise relatively smaller fractions of the material. Though loose and cohesive, the materials on the slopes of the stockpile naturally repose to an angle of approximately 30 degrees. Where it had been loaded out the toe area, the slope had steepened to about 39 degrees extending to the immediate dump site (see Figures 8 and 9).The material directly beneath the back tires of the haul truck at the dump point failed, sliding away approximately 6 to 8 feet back from the edge, 18 feet across the dump, and 10 feet down the steepened slope (see Figure 10). The weight of the loaded haul truck triggered this localized failure beneath the haul truck\u2019s back wheels, causing the haul truck to overturn and land on its roof approximately 30 feet down the slope at a slight angle, with the operator side slightly further downslope.The remaining berms on each side of the dump site were approximately 18 inches high. The material comprising the berms (which was the same as the loose overburden material being dumped) was soft, loose, and cohesive. On the day before the accident, the area had received approximately 1.4 inches of rain. Deep tire rutting at the surface of the dump area indicated the overburden material was still wet. Tire imprints remaining on the surface of the dump area clearly indicated the material used to construct the berms had little strength and could be easily penetrated by the tires of the moving truck. A noncontributory citation was issued. Cracking of the ground surface in the dump area was also evident (see Figure 11).EquipmentGeneral Information:\u00a0The haul truck involved in the accident was a 1994 Euclid Model R35 324TDC, rigid frame, off-highway truck. The truck was powered by a 6-cylinder, Cummins 18.8 liter, turbocharged diesel engine. The truck was 26-feet 11-inches long, 12-feet 1 inch wide and 13-feet 5-inches high. The rated maximum gross machine weight was 146,000 pounds, the empty weight was 65,100 pounds, and the payload capacity was 80,900 pounds.\nTruck Conditions Found:\u00a0Immediately after the truck was up righted, the control positions were noted. The transmission selector lever was in D (Drive). The emergency and load/dump brake toggle switch was found in the \u201cbrake applied\u201d position. The park brake, which was designed to automatically apply when the air pressure dropped below 40 psi, was found in the \u201cbrake applied\u201d position. The service brake pedal, retarder pedal, and throttle pedal operated freely.\nRepairs Made to Allow Testing:\u00a0The truck had an electronically controlled, automatic transmission with six forward speeds, neutral, and two reverse speeds. The shift control lever provided automatic shifting up to the gear position selected by the operator, but no higher. In the \u201cD\u201d position, the transmission started in first gear and automatically upshifted as the speed increased. When tested, the transmission gear selector operated to shift the truck into forward and reverse gears as described in the operator\u2019s manual.\nSteering System Design and Testing:\u00a0Two double-acting cylinders acted to steer the front wheels. Supplementary steering was provided by an automatic, electric-battery driven pump circuit that supplied hydraulic pressure to steer the front wheels if engine power was lost. A supplementary steering on-off switch was provided inside the operator\u2019s cab. The operator\u2019s manual instructed the operator to turn this switch to the \u201con\u201d position immediately after starting engine and to turn it to the \u201coff\u201d position just prior to shutting the engine down when parking the truck. The truck was maneuvered through a number of left and right turns and no steering deficiencies were found. The supplemental steering system functioned when tested and operated as described in the operator\u2019s manual.\nThrottle Pedal Testing:\u00a0The throttle pedal operated freely and returned to the low idle position when released.\nBraking System Overview:\u00a0The truck was equipped with a service brake, an emergency and load/dump brake, a parking brake, and a retarder.\nService Brake System Design and Testing:\u00a0A foot-operated valve controlled a dual circuit, air-over-oil service brake system. It had one circuit for the front dry disc brakes and another circuit for the rear axle wet disc brakes. The service brake pedal moved freely throughout its range of motion and returned to the brake released position when foot pressure was released. When tested, the service braking performance was above the minimum acceptable performance level and was in the preferred performance range as specified by Euclid for an R35 truck with dry caliper-disc front brakes and wet disc rear brakes. The brake linings on the dry disc front brakes exceeded the minimum lining thickness specified by Euclid. Both of the front axle brake discs exceeded the minimum Euclid disc thickness specification. No braking system leaks were found. The brake discs were dry and clean with no oil contamination. No service brake deficiencies were found when the truck was operated and numerous stops were made. An additional test showed the service brake had the ability to stop and hold the empty truck on a 15% test slope.\nEmergency and Load/Dump Brake Design and Testing:\u00a0The truck was equipped with an on-off toggle switch for the emergency and load/dump brake. This switch was designed to apply the rear brakes at full pressure. The Euclid operator\u2019s manual stated that this switch should be used to hold the attended machine stationary for loading, dumping, and waiting. The emergency and load/dump brake control functioned to apply and release the emergency and load/dump brake. When tested, the emergency and load/dump brake had the ability to hold the empty truck on a 15% test slope.\nParking Brake Design and Testing:\u00a0The parking brake was a spring actuated, air released, driveline drum brake mounted on the rear of the transmission. A push-pull hand control for the parking brake was located on the dashboard. The parking brake was also designed to automatically actuate if the air pressure dropped to 40 +/- 5 psi. The parking brake control functioned to apply and release the parking brake. When tested, the parking brake had the capability of holding the empty truck on a 15% test slope.\nRetarder System Design and Testing:\u00a0A foot operated valve controlled the air/oil actuation of the same wet disc brakes used by the service braking system. The operator could vary the retarding force by varying how far the retarder pedal was depressed. The retarder pedal functioned to apply and release the retarder. When tested, the retarder had the capability of holding the empty truck on a 15% test slope.\nCompressor Governor and Low Air Warning Tests:\u00a0The compressor cut-in and cut-out pressures, when tested, were 105 psi and 130 psi which was in the correct operating range as specified by Euclid. The truck was equipped with a wig-wag low air pressure warning device at the top of the windshield. When tested, the wig-wag arm dropped into the operator\u2019s field of view when system pressure was reduced to 95 psi, which was in the correct operating range as specified by Euclid.\nSeat Belt:\u00a0The seat belt latched and unlatched when tested. The investigators could not determine if Crane was wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident because he climbed out of the cab after the accident.\nSummaryNo problems were found with the haul truck\u2019s transmission, steering system, throttle pedal, braking systems, or the retarder that would have restricted the ability of the driver to control the truck at the time of the accident.WeatherOn the day of the accident, weather conditions were clear with an average temperature of 46 degrees Fahrenheit. Sunrise was 6:59 a.m. Average wind speed was 14 mph with gusts up to 39 mph. On November 24, 2014, the day before the accident, the recorded total rainfall for the area was 1.42 inches. The investigators determined that the resultant wet conditions present at the overburden dump site, due to previous rainfall in the area, was a contributing factor in the accident.ExaminationsManagement failed to inspect the dump area periodically throughout the shift as changing conditions warranted. Persons responsible for visually inspecting the dump area prior to work commencing did not recognize clear evidence the ground would not support the mobile equipment. This evidence included loose, wet, cohesive material that had been significantly steepened by excavating material from the toe of the overburden dump area. Cracks were also found on the surface at the top of the dumping location. The person examining the dumping location should have recognized the instability of the dump area and should have required that loads of overburden material be dumped a safe distance back from the edge.", "TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE": "James P. Crane had 10\u00bd years of mining experience as a truck driver, all at this mine. A representative of MSHA\u2019s Educational Field Services reviewed the mine operator\u2019s Part 46 training records for Crane. He had received all required training.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "The investigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified the following root causes:Root Cause:\u00a0Management failed to inspect the dumping location periodically throughout the shift as changing conditions warranted. Material had been loaded from the stockpile directly below the dump location which steepened the slope angle and reduced the stability.Corrective Action:\u00a0Management established policies and procedures to ensure that dumping locations are inspected at the beginning of the shift and during mining operations for signs of slope instability. The top of the dump area is to be examined for cracks, unstable ground, and sunken or soft areas. The load-out area is to be examined for signs of undercutting and over steepening of the slope. All mobile equipment operators were trained in these new policies and procedures.Root Cause:\u00a0Management failed to ensure that loads were dumped a safe distance back from the undercut edge of the overburden stockpile.Corrective Action:\u00a0Management established policies and procedures to ensure that loads are dumped a safe distance back from the edge of the overburden stockpile. A front-end loader will be used to push the material over the edge. No material will be dumped over the edge while material is being removed from the toe of the stockpile.

Fletcher and Co.\u00a0 The machine is provided with drill station canopies equipped with slider extensions.\u00a0 The ATRS system is an \u201cL\u201d style - \u201cT bar\u201d with one ATRS pad on each end of the unit measuring 16 inches long by 12 inches wide.\u00a0 The width of the ATRS system is manually adjustable with four pin selections on each side, each 6 inches apart.\u00a0 The pins were located in the second slot from the inside.\u00a0 At this setting in an 18-foot wide entry, the left pad was measured to be 58 inches from the rib.\u00a0 This is within the allowable maximum distance of 60 inches.Twin Boom Roof Bolting Machine ControlsThere are two sets of controls on the roof bolting machine that control different functions.\u00a0 The \u201cinch tram\u201d controls are located near the center of the machine and control movement of the roof-bolting machine.\u00a0 The controls for the ATRS are also located at this location.\u00a0 The roof drilling controls are the second set of controls. \u00a0An attached canopy is located over the roof drilling controls and provides protection for the roof bolting machine operator.\u00a0 The canopy and roof drilling controls move/swing as one unit.\u00a0 The distance between the last installed bolt and the canopy increases or decreases depending on the location of the roof drilling controls.\u00a0 This machine is not provided with controls at the \u201cinch tram\u201d control station to move/swing the roof drilling controls.\u00a0 These controls are located with the roof drilling controls.Normal Roof Bolt Installation ProcedureWhen the roof bolting machine is advanced to install the new row of bolts, the ATRS system is set against the roof, providing temporary support.\u00a0 The current approved roof control plan allows the ATRS system to be 6 feet from the last row of permeant support and 5 feet from the closest rib.\u00a0 When the roof bolting machine was positioned to reconstruct the accident, the distance between the ATRS pad and the last row of bolts measured 60.5 inches and the distance between the ATRS pad and the left rib measured 58 inches. \u00a0The placement of the temporary support provided by the ATRS system was in compliance with the current approved roof control plan.\u00a0 The roof drilling controls are located on the outside of the machine close to the ATRS. \u00a0This location places the roof bolting machine operator between the coal rib and drill station to operate the controls. \u00a0The normal roof bolting sequence is to first install the outside bolt in the row.\u00a0 \u00a0The inside bolt is installed last (Refer again to Appendix A for roof bolt installation sequence).\u00a0 This installation sequence leaves the roof drilling controls and canopy adjacent to the machine when the row is completed.\u00a0 The roof drilling controls are normally left in the inside bolting position to advance the roof-bolting machine for installing the next row of roof bolts.\u00a0 The canopy over the drilling station was not in optimal position to deflect the rock that fell in the area between \u00a0the coal rib, the last row of installed support and the ATRS pad.\u00a0 Savage was located in this area between the roof drilling controls and the \u201cinch tram\u201d controls, when the accident occurred.\u00a0GeologyThe rock fell from a contact location where two different types of rock intersected. \u00a0The rock separated from beneath a compaction slickenside, which represented a plane of low cohesion while disrupting the lateral continuity of the strata.\u00a0 The compaction zone represents a narrow sand channel that meanders northeast/southwest across the section, but lobes of the sand channel were only exposed in the mining horizon in the No. 2 entry/Crosscut No. 239 intersection.\u00a0 The small pods of sandstone are very hard and dense; producing sparks when struck with a hammer, and define a keel shape that protrudes from the roof.\u00a0 Shale of the immediate roof was compacted around the obdurate sandstone, forming meandering slickensides that follow the trend of the keel-shaped sandstone.\u00a0 The compaction slickensides represent low-angle folds, dipping from 8-11 degrees away from a central axis that follows the trend of the sandstone.\u00a0 The fatal rock represents a slickenside-bounded block of shale that destabilized.Examination of the SectionPossible adverse roof conditions were identifiable across the section.\u00a0 These areas were bolted by experienced roof bolters and examined (preshifted) by a certified foreman.\u00a0 The adverse roof was present in the outby cross cut between the No. 2 to No. 1 entries and extended into the No. 2 entry where the accident occurred.\u00a0 However, the adverse roof in the cross cut was not as pronounced being broad and shallow, allowing the condition to go undetected.\u00a0 \u00a0Roof Control PlanThe last fully revised and consolidated roof control plan was approved on September 5, 2014. \u00a0The plan permitted a maximum mining width of 18 feet and required the roof to be supported with fully-grouted roof bolts at least 48 inches long in normal mining conditions. \u00a0Roof bolts are spaced no more than 4 feet apart, side to side, and a maximum distance of 4 \u00bd feet apart between rows.\u00a0 When mining over or within 100 feet of a \u201cPittsburgh break\u201d zone, two cables bolts are required to be installed between every row of support. \u00a0If torque tension bolts are used as primary support, two cable bolts are required to be installed between every other row of bolts.\u00a0 A \u201cPittsburgh break\u201d zone refers to areas of old workings, partial mining, or barrier pillars left in the Pittsburg coal seam which lies 80 feet beneath the Sewickley seam. \u00a0The 2-left section had just crossed a \u201cPittsburgh break\u201d zone in the No. 6, 7, and 8 entries at cross cut 239.\u00a0 The roof supports being used at the time of the accident in all entries were 6-foot torque tension roof bolts in conjunction with two - twelve foot cable bolts installed between every other the row of supportThe extended cut section of the roof control plan also required the depths of the cut to be reduced to a length sufficient to effectively control the mine roof when adverse roof conditions are encountered. \u00a0Adverse conditions are classified as clay veins, slips, mud seams, excessive water coming from the roof washouts or other irregularities. \u00a0Where these conditions are encountered, longer bolts with boards, or larger plates, and if needed crossbars are to be installed.At the time of the accident all measurements and distances required by the roof control plan were complied with.The mine operator was following the provisions of the roof control plan pertaining to the \u201cPittsburgh break\u201d zone across the entire section. \u00a0Entries 6, 7, and 8, were still within the zone.Experience and TrainingThe victim had over 29 years mining experience, 24 years at this mine with 19 \u00bd years as a roof bolting machine operator. \u00a0He received task training as a roof bolting machine operator on October 5, 2012, along with experienced miner training.\u00a0 The victim\u2019s annual refresher training was received on October 31, 2014, and was current at the time of the accident. \u00a0", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "An analysis was conducted to identify the most basic cause of the accident that was correctable thought management controls.\u00a0 Causal factors were identified that if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated the consequences.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nListed below are causal factors identified during the analysis and their corrective actions implemented to prevent a reoccurrence of the accident.1. Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator did not assure there was adequate protection provided between the ATRS, the rib, and the last row of supports. \u00a0The ATRS had not been extended outward enough for the pads of the unit to come in contact with a rock that fell from the left rib line. The ATRS system on this machine is manually adjusted with four settings.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, it was set in the second setting from the inside leaving a distance of 58 inches from the outside edge of the pad to the rib.\u00a0 If the setting had been in one of the outside slots, the pad would likely have been in contact with the fallen rock and possibly prevented the accident.Corrective action:\u00a0\u00a0The approved roof control plan was revised to require that one of the two most outside slots be used during roof bolt installation. \u00a0\u00a0The miners were trained in the provisions of the revised roof control plan.2. Root Cause:\u00a0\u00a0The mine operator did not assure there was adequate protection provided between the ATRS, the rib, and the last row of supports. After the second roof bolt (middle) is installed in each cycle, the roof drilling controls and canopy remained adjacent to the machine while the machine was advanced to install the next row of roof bolts. \u00a0This position, adjacent to the roof bolting machine, left an unsupported area between the ATRS and the last row of support. \u00a0The canopy over the drilling station was not in optimal position to defect the rock that fell in the area bounded by the coal rib, the last row of installed support, and the ATRS pad.Corrective action:\u00a0\nThe approved roof control plan was revised to require the drill station controls and the canopy to be moved to the outside position after the middle support is installed and before lowering the ATRS. \u00a0The miners were trained in the provisions of the revised roof control plan.", "CONCLUSION": "The accident occurred because a roof anomaly (slickensided rock) was present, but was not identified prior to positioning the roof bolting machine and starting the roof bolting process.\u00a0 The ATRS system was engaged with the roof at the time of the accident, but the pads of the ATRS were not in contact with the destabilized rock. \u00a0The position of the roof drilling controls and canopy were adjacent to the machine, causing the victim to travel under the rock which fell without warning.\u00a0 The mine operator did not assure that adequate protection was provided between the ATRS, the rib, and the last row of supports.", "ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS": "A 103(J) Order, Number 8060499, was issued to Red Bone Mining Company at approximately 10:30 p.m. to ensure the safety of all persons at the operation and to prevent the destruction of any evidence which would assist in investigating the cause or causes of the accident until an investigation was completed and the area deemed safe.\n\u00a0\n"}}, "/data-reports/fatality-reports/2014/fatality-25-november-10-2014": {"report-url": "https://www.msha.gov/data-reports/fatality-reports/2014/fatality-25-november-10-2014", "accidnet-classification": "Falling, Rolling, or Sliding Rock or Material of Any Kind", "location": "R&S STONE, INC., Virginia", "mine-type": "Metal and Non-Metal", "mine-controller": "Terri Reed  Smith; Terry Garth  Reed", "mined-mineral": "Crushed, Broken Granite", "incident-date": "2014-11-10T08:30:00-05:00", "public-notice": "This posting serves to provide a public notice to employees of the mine, employees of the mining company(s), employees of independent contractors with any connection to the mine, persons with any connection to the mine, and any person with information regarding the cause or contributing factors of this accident.\nPlease provide any information to:\nBilly Ratliff, Lead Accident InvestigatorPhone:\u00a0724-772-2334\n", "preliminary-report": "On November 10, 2014, the victim was seriously injured at this mine.

Hixon, Crusher Operator, age 45, was using a torch to cut a drill bit wedged in a jaw crusher, when the bit released and struck him.\u00a0 Hixon was hospitalized and died on January 17, 2015, as a result of his injuries.\nThe accident occurred due to management\u2019s failure to establish and implement policies and procedures to safely clear a jaw crusher.\u00a0 The jaw crusher was not blocked against hazardous motion to protect miners from flying/falling materials resulting from its movement.Hixon did not receive task training on safe work procedures for clearing or dislodging material in a jaw crusher.\u00a0 Specifically, he was not trained on the potential hazards resulting from a sudden release of stored energy from a jammed crusher.", "GENERAL INFORMATION": "R&S Stone, Inc., a surface crushed granite operation owned and operated by R&S Stone, Inc., is located in Floyd, Floyd County, Virginia.\u00a0 The principal operating official is Terry G. Reed, President.\u00a0 The mine typically operates one 8\u2011hour shift, five days per week and employs seven persons.\u00a0\nAt this operation, granite is drilled and blasted from a multiple-bench quarry.\u00a0 An excavator is used to load a haul truck which transports and dumps the broken granite into a pan feeder.\u00a0 The material is then fed into a jaw crusher for initial sizing.\u00a0 When smaller sizes are needed, the material is conveyed to a cone crusher for further reduction.\u00a0 After crushing and sizing, the material is stockpiled.\u00a0 The finished products are sold as construction aggregates.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on September 11, 2014.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On Friday November 7, 2014, at approximately 2:45 p.m., Carl A. Hixon, Crusher Operator, went to check the partially filled primary jaw crusher because it was jammed.\u00a0 Before checking on the problem, he de-energized the crusher and locked it out.\u00a0 Hixon and Cherokee Gibson, Laborer, entered the crusher and began to manually lift rocks out of the machine.\u00a0 They found that a 7-inch long by 5-inch diameter drill bit was wedged lengthwise between the jaw plates in the crusher. \u00a0The crew discussed options for removal of the bit.\u00a0 An attempt was made to remotely remove the drill bit from the crusher using a small backhoe to pull a chain wrapped around the bit, the drill bit would not move.\u00a0 At the end of the shift, Hixon reported to the mine office and discussed the problem of removing the bit with Tammy Evans, Mine Foreman.\u00a0 At about 4:00 p.m., everyone left the mine.During the weekend, Hixon and Reed worked together to install a septic system at a non-mining-related job site.\u00a0 At that time, Hixon and Reed discussed the drill bit wedged in the jaw crusher at the mine.\u00a0 Reed instructed Hixon to use the mine\u2019s larger pit excavator and chains to remove the drill bit from the crusher.\u00a0 Reed informed Evans of his discussions with Hixon and reiterated his instruction to use the pit excavator on the next attempt.On the day of the accident, Hixon picked up Kevin Faulkner and Cesar Martinez, Equipment Operators, at an off-site shop and took them to the mine.\u00a0 They arrived at the mine at approximately 7:30 a.m.\u00a0 Faulkner and Martinez went to fuel the mobile equipment while Hixon assisted Evans with the beginning of shift workplace examinations.\u00a0 Hixon and Evans completed the examinations about 8:00 a.m., and Evans went to the mine office while Hixon returned to the plant.When Hixon arrived at the jaw crusher, he was joined by Faulkner, Martinez, and Thomas A. Fox, Equipment Operator.\u00a0 Together, they attempted to use the backhoe one more time to remove the drill bit but were unsuccessful.\u00a0 Martinez then left to grease the processing equipment while Hixon moved a service truck onto the crusher feed ramp and unrolled the truck\u2019s onboard oxy-acetylene torch hoses.\u00a0 At approximately 8:15 a.m., Hixon climbed down into the jaw crusher with the welding torch to cut the bit free. \u00a0Faulkner and Fox watched Hixon from a work platform approximately 12 feet above the jaw crusher.\u00a0 Martinez returned to the crusher and waited in the service truck nearby.\u00a0 At approximately 8:27\u00a0a.m., the stored energy (pressure) from the crusher ejected the bit and it struck Hixon.\u00a0\u00a0When Faulkner saw Hixon slumped over and apparently unconscious, he immediately radioed the office and requested emergency medical assistance (EMS).\u00a0 Fox entered the crusher to check Hixon.\u00a0 Martinez heard a loud noise, while in the truck and ran to the crusher to investigate.\u00a0 When Martinez arrived at the crusher, Faulkner told him to close the regulators on the torch and then climbed into the crusher.\u00a0 Reed heard Faulkner\u2019s call for help and also ran to the crusher.\u00a0 Martinez and Reed helped Fox and Faulkner pull Hixon from the crusher and administer first aid until EMS arrived.A life-flight helicopter transported Hixon to a local hospital where he was admitted in critical condition. On November 27, 2014, Hixon was transported to an extended care facility in Greensboro, North Carolina, where he died on January 17, 2015.\u00a0 The cause of death was attributed to multiple blunt force trauma.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "MSHA was notified of the accident at 9:30 a.m. on November 10, 2014, by a telephone call from Terri R. Smith, Vice-President, to the National Call Center.\u00a0 The National Call Center notified Kevin T. Hardester, Staff Assistant, and an investigation was started the same day.\u00a0 An order was issued under Section 103(j) of the Mine Act.\u00a0 After an Authorized Representative arrived at the mine site the order was later modified to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act.\u00a0 A Part 50 citation was issued for untimely reporting.MSHA\u2019s accident investigator traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident.\u00a0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, mine employees, and the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals, and Energy.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of the Accident\nOn November 10, 2014, Hixon slid approximately 12 feet downward on a piece of rubber belting, and climbed into the jaw crusher (see Figure 1).\u00a0 A noncontributory citation was issued for a violation of 30 CFR 56.11001.\u00a0 Hixon was not protected from hazardous movement of either the crusher components or the drill bit while he was in the crusher.\u00a0 While standing on a rock, Hixon used a torch to attempt to cut the drill bit free from between the jaw plates.\u00a0 Soon after Hixon started to cut the bit, the bit was forcibly ejected from the crusher and struck him (see Figure 2).Drilling and Blasting\nBetween October 18 and October 29, 2014, Fox operated a company-owned Atlas Copco Model ROC F9-11 highwall drill for eight shifts to complete a 52\u2011hole pattern for subsequent blasting.\u00a0 The blast holes were drilled in 9 rows to depths of 15 feet and 30 feet.\u00a0 According to Fox, two drill bits were lost at the bottom of separate 30-foot deep blast holes.\u00a0 After the drilling was completed, the excavator operator, the haul truck driver, and the crusher operator were instructed by Fox to watch out for the two missing bits.Austin Powder Company was contracted to conduct the blasting operation.\u00a0 On October 30, 2014, at 1:16 p.m., the shot was initiated.\u00a0 The contractor\u2019s blasting report shows that the volume of material produced by the shot was 4,880\u00a0cubic yards or 11,224\u00a0tons.After the shot, one of the missing drill bits was found while the excavator was loading trucks.\u00a0 The second bit lodged lengthwise in the primary jaw crusher.\u00a0 This is the drill bit involved in the accident.\u00a0 The drill bit was a 5-inch diameter by 7-inch long Model T51 DC Retractable bit, manufactured by Atlas Copco (see Figure 3). \u00a0The drill bit weighed approximately 27 pounds.\u00a0Lost drill bits are often found after they pass through the jaw crusher at this operation.\u00a0 When interviewed, Reed stated that this was the first drill bit to get caught lengthwise between the jaw plates and jam the crusher.\u00a0\u00a0Jaw Crusher\nThe Model MS-3042 jaw crusher involved in the accident was manufactured in November 1995 by Minyu Machinery Corp., LTD, located in Taiwan, Republic of China.\u00a0 The jaw crusher was the primary component of a portable rock crushing unit that included a vibrating rock feed table.\u00a0 The complete unit was assembled in 1996 by Construction Equipment Corporation (CEC) of Lake Grove, Oregon. \u00a0The unit was purchased by the current mine operator in 1998. \u00a0\u00a0Figure 4 shows a cross-section of the jaw crusher.Jaw Crusher Design\nThe jaw crusher is driven by an electric motor with a smaller multi-v-belt pulley driving a larger multi-v-belt pulley attached to the pitman arm shaft.\u00a0 A large flywheel is mounted on the opposite end of the pitman arm shaft.\u00a0 The pitman arm shaft is mounted to the crusher main frame using two large roller bearings, one on each end of the shaft.\u00a0 The pitman arm (the moving part or \u201cjaw\u201d of the crusher) is mounted to the pitman arm shaft using two large roller bearings and the shaft can rotate freely within the pitman arm.\u00a0\u00a0The pitman arm shaft is designed as an eccentric, a circular disk that is solidly fixed to a rotating axle with its centre offset from that of the axle, and provides the action to crush and feed the material (rock) into the crusher.\u00a0 By design, the diameter of the eccentric of the pitman arm shaft is larger than the diameter of the shaft mounted to the crusher frame.\u00a0 As the shaft rotates, the eccentric portion of shaft rotates within the pitman arm.\u00a0 Figure 5 is a representative illustration of the end view of the pitman arm shaft or the eccentric.The toggle plate acts as a fulcrum for the lower (lever) portion of the pitman arm.\u00a0 The edges of the plate are not connected to the pitman arm or toggle block but are inside the groove of the toggle seats, one in the back of the pitman arm and one in the front of the toggle block.\u00a0 The tension rods connected to the lower portion of the pitman arm are spring loaded to keep the toggle plate in position while the crusher is operating.\u00a0The shim plates are steel plates of different thicknesses that are used to adjust the gap between the main frame and the bottom of the pitman arm.\u00a0 The size of the gap changes the size of the crushed material leaving the bottom of the crusher.\u00a0 The hydraulic cylinder attached to the main frame and toggle block is used only when changing the shim plates.\u00a0 Once the toggle block bolts are loosened, the hydraulic cylinder is used to push the pitman arm away from the shims, allowing the shims to be installed or removed accordingly.\u00a0 The cylinder can also be used to help retract the toggle block when retightening the bolts.\u00a0 The investigators determined that a hydraulic cylinder was not installed in the crusher; however, a hydraulic cylinder is not needed to operate the crusher and its use is not recommended for clearing jams.Jaw Crusher Operation\nThe jaw crusher is used to crush large material into smaller material.\u00a0 The large rotating mass of the large v-belt pulley and flywheel drives the pitman arm and creates the crushing action.\u00a0 The motion of the pitman arm forces the material lower into the jaws with each shaft rotation as the material is reduced in size.\u00a0 Once the material reaches the size dictated by the gap between the main frame and pitman arm, the material drops from the bottom of the crusher.\nThe Parts and Service Manual provided with the jaw crusher recommends placing material into a grizzly or other type of feeding unit to avoid overloading the crusher.\u00a0 The manual also recommends using an electric overhead hoist to clear the crusher when it is jammed.\u00a0 The design of this crusher does not allow for the jaws to be disengaged or otherwise opened to remove a clog or clear a jam.\nWhen the investigators asked if anyone attempted to open the jaw plates to allow the drill bit to fall through, Reed stated that, \u201cthis is an old-style jaw crusher and the jaw cannot be opened until it completes its full cycle of closure.\u201dWeather\nOn the day of the accident, weather conditions were clear with an average temperature of 47\u00a0degrees Fahrenheit.\u00a0 Sunrise was at 6:54 a.m.\u00a0 Weather and lighting were not considered to be contributing factors to the accident.SummaryNo blocking was used to protect the victim from hazardous movement of either the jaw crusher components or the drill bit.\nThe haul truck dumped rock directly into the pan feeder which fed the jaw crusher.\u00a0 The mine operator did not use a grizzly or other recommended type of feeding unit to prevent unwanted items such as a drill bit from entering the crusher.\nThe rotating mass of the crusher applies a large amount of compressive force to any object stuck in the jaw.\u00a0 When an object, such as a drill bit, is jammed in the crusher, this compressive force supplies enough energy to propel an object from the crusher when that object is loosened.\u00a0\u00a0\nTRAINING AND EXPERIENCECarl A. Hixon had 3 years 20 weeks of mining experience as a crusher operator, all at this mine.\u00a0 The investigators reviewed the mine operator\u2019s Part 46 training records for Hixon and found that he had received all required training with the exception of task training on removing objects jammed in the crusher.\u00a0 There is no evidence that Hixon or any other miners received adequate task training on safe operating procedures related to dislodging objects stuck in the jaw crusher.ROOT CAUSE ANALYSISThe investigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified the following root causes:Root Cause:\u00a0\u00a0Management failed to establish policies or procedures to protect miners from hazardous motion of the jaw crusher components or objects stuck in the jaw crusher.\u00a0Corrective Action:\u00a0\u00a0Management established policies and procedures to ensure that miners would not enter the jaw crusher to free any jammed material or objects and trained miners on these procedures.\u00a0 The onsite Kobelco SK400 excavator, equipped with a 10,000 pound hammer, will be used to dislodge any items that become wedged through the crusher plates.Root Cause:\u00a0\u00a0Management failed to task train miners on safe procedures for dislodging objects stuck in the jaw crusher, and hazards resulting from a sudden release of stored energy from a jammed crusher.Corrective Action:\u00a0\u00a0Management has revised their Part 46 training plan to include task training for all miners on safe procedures for dislodging objects stuck in the jaw crusher, including the hazards resulting from a sudden release of stored energy from a jammed crusher.\u00a0 All miners were trained according to the revised plan.\u00a0CONCLUSION\u00a0The accident occurred due to management\u2019s failure to establish and implement policies and procedures to safely clear a jaw crusher.\u00a0 The jaw crusher was not blocked against hazardous motion to protect miners from flying/falling materials resulting from its movement.\u00a0Hixon did not receive task training on safe work procedures for clearing or dislodging material in a jaw crusher.\u00a0 Specifically, he was not trained on the potential hazards resulting in a sudden release of stored energy from the jammed crusher.ENFORCEMENT ACTIONSIssued to R&S Stone, Inc.Order No. 8731261\u00a0- Issued on November 10, 2014, under Section 103(j) of the Mine Act.\u00a0 An Authorized Representative modified this order to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act upon arrival at the mine:An accident occurred at this operation on November 10, 2014, at 8:27 hours.\u00a0 This order is being issued, under Section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety Act of 1977, to prevent the destruction of any evidence which would assist in investigating the cause or causes of the accident. \u00a0It prohibits all activity at the area of the plant where the accident occurred until MSHA deems that it is safe to resume normal operations in this area. \u00a0This order was initially issued orally to the mine operator at 10:10 hours and has now been reduced to writing.\nThe initial order is modified to reflect that MSHA is now proceeding under the authority of Section 103(k) of the Federal Mine and Health Act of 1977.\u00a0 This Section 103(k) Order is intended to protect the safety of all persons, including those involved in the rescue and recovery operations or investigation of the accident.\u00a0 The mine operator shall obtain prior approval from an Authorized Representative of the Secretary for all actions to recover and / or restore operations in the affected area.\u00a0 Additionally, the mine operator is reminded of its existing obligations to prevent the destruction of evidence that would aid in the investigating the cause or causes of the accident.\nThe order was terminated on November 12, 2014, after conditions that contributed to the accident no longer existed.\u00a0Citation No. 8731264\u00a0-\u00a0Issued under Section 104(a) of the Mine Act for a violation of 30 CFR \u00a7\u00a056.14105:A serious accident occurred at this operation on November 10, 2014 at 0827 hours, when an employee entered the jaw crusher to cut a lodged drill bit that seized the jaw crusher.\u00a0 The power was locked out but the bit contained stored energy from the pressure of the jaw.\u00a0 The employee bent over the bit with a torch when the bit sprang from the jaw and struck him in the chest and head.\u00a0 The position of the employee did not protect him from the hazardous motion.\u00a0 Failure to protect the employee from hazardous motion could lead to a fatal accident.\u00a0 The employee died on January 17, 2015, as a result of his injuries.\nCitation No. 8915004\u00a0-\u00a0Issued under of Section 104(a) of the Mine Act for a violation of 30 CFR \u00a7\u00a046.7(b):Management failed to task train miners on safe procedures for dislodging objects stuck in the jaw crusher, including the projectile hazard associated with a sudden release of stored energy.\u00a0 This failure placed miners at risk and contributed to the serious accident that occurred at this operation on November 10, 2014, when a miner was seriously injured while using a torch to cut a drill bit that was wedged in a jaw crusher.\u00a0 When the bit was freed, stored energy was released and the bit became a flying projectile that struck the miner. The victim was hospitalized and subsequently died on January 17, 2015, as a result of his injuries.\n\u00a0Approved: _____________________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Date: __________________Kevin H.

(McCoy), arrived for the night shift.\u00a0 He and the other crew members of the night shift met at area 101 of NARM.\u00a0 They held their nightly meeting to discuss safety and receive their respective job assignments for the shift.\u00a0 The miners performed their pre-operational checks.\u00a0 On the pre-operational examination form filled out by Reimer for the Caterpillar 777B haul truck, company ID No. 77-08, serial No. 4XJ0023, he did not document any defects that affected the safe operation of the truck.The shift was proceeding normally until approximately 9:45 to 9:50 p.m., when Reimer, after completing his fifth load, pulled into the staging area. \u00a0He turned out his truck lights and sat in his truck.\u00a0 Two of the haul truck drivers checked on Reimer as they drove past his haul truck on their way to the loading area.\u00a0 Both drivers reported that Reimer looked all right and driver Mike Orozco stated Reimer was sitting up, and waved as he drove past.\u00a0 The second driver, Leroy Bohne, stated Reimer\u2019s head was resting on his arm, his arm was positioned on the top of the steering wheel.\u00a0 Bohne stated Reimer raised his head when he honked his horn while driving past.\u00a0Victor Kirshner, Excavator Operator, made repeated attempts to contact Reimer by radio and have him pull forward, but Reimer did not answer.\u00a0 Reimer remained in his haul truck, with the lights out, for 10 to 15 minutes.\u00a0 At approximately 10:00 p.m., Kirshner radioed the McCoy night shift foreman, Craig Sadler, telling him there was a problem with one of his trucks.\u00a0 Sadler radioed back that he was leaving the dump area and coming that way.\u00a0 At that time, Reimer put his haul truck in gear, turned the wheels sharply to the left, and exited the staging area at a high rate of speed.The haul truck then traveled 2,296 feet through a top soil limit area, through a drainage ditch and over a 4 foot high berm.\u00a0 The truck continued traveling south across the old top soil berm section, and went over a 3 foot high berm in the process.\u00a0 The truck continued traveling south through the cast berm section and it broke through the cast berm which measured approximately 6 to 9 feet high and 32 feet wide.\u00a0 The truck continued traveling in a southerly direction through the drill pattern section (cast section).\u00a0 The truck traveled through the shot pattern, running over drill material 3 to 5 feet in height and over six loaded shot holes.\u00a0 The truck then traveled over the north highwall of the East Elk Pit.\u00a0 The left front side of the truck\u2019s operator compartment struck the top bench of the highwall before falling to the pit bottom.\u00a0 The victim was ejected at some point.\u00a0 This portion of the event lasted approximately 4 minutes according to testimony. \u00a0See Appendix A for the haul truck\u2019s path of travel.A mayday call went out at 10:19 p.m., when Sadler, Harry Ruffing, McCoy Mechanic, and Trevor Frogge, Blasting Crew Member, Western Explosives Systems Company (WESCO), followed the truck tracks through the blasting area to the highwall.\u00a0 They observed the truck wreckage in the bottom of the pit.\u00a0 NARM management personnel and the Surface Mine Emergency Team (SMET) were called. \u00a0They helped with the search, rescue, and recovery of the victim.\u00a0 Some of the first to arrive were John Heimann, Overburden Supervisor, Matt Sudbeck, NARM Dragline Supervisor, and Josh Turner, Step up or Lead man.\u00a0 \u00a0Sudbeck and Brian McDermott, Equipment Operator NARM, were first to arrive at the bottom of the East Elk Pit.\u00a0 They crawled over the berm blocking the roadway and noticed a small fire at the wreckage site from their position at the berm area.\u00a0 They continued to the wreckage of the Caterpillar 777B.\u00a0 Sudbeck and McDermott searched the wreckage area but they did not locate the victim at the scene.\u00a0 They noticed reflective material (vest) on the highwall on a coal bench approximately 65 feet above the pit bottom.\u00a0 The SMET team, led by incident commander (IC) Justin Malone, was dispatched to the scene at 10:24 p.m.\u00a0 A rubber-tired bulldozer had been called to the scene earlier to breach the berm and allow rescue personnel into the pit area.\u00a0 Malone and others searched the accident scene and confirmed no one was in the wreckage.\u00a0 The Campbell County Sheriff\u2019s office was notified at 10:36 p.m.\u00a0 The county sheriff and rescue personnel arrived at the mine site at 10:57 p.m.\u00a0 They arrived at the accident scene at approximately 11:15 p.m.\u00a0 Search, rescue, and recovery operations were already in progress. \u00a0The victim was recovered from a coal ledge on the highwall, which was approximately 65 feet above the pit floor.\u00a0 The victim was transported from the scene by Campbell County Deputy Coroner, Gail Graham who pronounced him dead at 5:59 a.m., October 19, 2014.\u00a0 An autopsy was performed by Campbell County Coroner Tom Eekhoff.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On October 18, 2014, at 11:53 p.m., the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) National Call Center received notification that a serious accident had occurred at NARM.\u00a0 Sid Hansen, Coal District 9 Supervisory Mining Engineer \u2013 Roof Control, received notification on the District\u2019s emergency call phone at 12:08 a.m., October 19, 2014. \u00a0A verbal 103(j) order was issued to Duane Myers at 12:15 a.m., October 19, 2014.Citation No. 8483420 was issued to Duane Myers, NARM Director of Safety and Training, for a violation of 30 CFR \u00a7 50.10 for a failure to report this fatal accident immediately, at once, without delay, and within 15 minutes.MSHA Inspector David D. Hamilton from the Gillette, Wyoming, MSHA Field Office was dispatched to the mine.\u00a0 After assessing the scene, the 103(j) order was modified to a 103(k) order to ensure the safety of all persons involved in the accident investigation.\u00a0 MSHA accident investigator Gary J. Wilson was dispatched from the Price, Utah, MSHA Field Office, on October 19, 2014.Photos and measurements were taken of the route of travel of the Caterpillar 777B driven by the victim.\u00a0 Hamilton began the investigation of existing physical conditions.\u00a0 He also conducted initial interviews with mine personnel and McCoy personnel who were present at the scene.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe investigation of the physical aspects of the accident was completed on October 22, 2014. Digital photographs, relevant measurements, and sketches of the scene were developed as part of the investigation. \u00a0The investigation included a review of training records, mine and contractor examination records, and contractor maintenance records. \u00a0Interviews were conducted on October 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24, 2014, with individuals having knowledge of the accident.\nThe investigation was conducted in conjunction with the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services, State Mines Division.\u00a0 Those persons who were interviewed are listed in Appendix B.", "DISCUSSION": "The path of the haul truckThe haul truck\u2019s path according to an engineered report using global positioning satellite (GPS) plotting shows the following:The truck exited the staging area by taking a sharp left hand turn and traveled to the top soil limit area.\u00a0 It went over the 3 foot cut where the excavator had removed the top soil.\u00a0 Then the truck traveled north before making a turn to the west, and continued on a wide looping turn, eventually turning back to the south toward the staging area.\u00a0 Next, the truck traveled 786 feet across the topsoil limit section, before it went over a ditch (clearing a 5 foot wide section of the ditch) and traveled through a 4 foot berm.\u00a0 The truck continued traveling south 669 feet across the old topsoil berm section and went over a 3 foot high berm.\u00a0 Afterwards, the truck continued traveling south 280 feet through the cast berm section. \u00a0It then turned slightly to the west where it went through the cast berm, which is approximately 6 to 9 feet high and 32 feet wide.\u00a0 The axle height of a Caterpillar 777B haul truck is 4 feet and 1 inch.\u00a0 Next, the truck continued in a slight southwesterly direction of travel through the drill pattern section for 382 feet.\u00a0 The truck continued on this route for 179 feet through the shot pattern, running over drill material 3-5 feet in height.\u00a0 Lastly, the truck ran over six loaded shot holes before going over the north highwall of the East Elk Pit.Caterpillar 777B Haul TruckThe wreckage of the Caterpillar 777B haul truck was too severe for MSHA Technical Support evaluate the condition of the truck.\u00a0 The maintenance records, pre-operational checks, and work orders for the McCoy equipment at this site were reviewed for any reported equipment problems.\u00a0 The only maintenance record for this truck was the repair to a broken air line to the operator\u2019s seat, on October 9, 2014.\u00a0 The operator of this haul truck from the day shift (on the day of the accident) was interviewed.\u00a0 He stated the truck was in sound condition and this truck was one of the best the contractor owned. \u00a0After the truck was removed from the pit, the operator\u2019s compartment was examined.\u00a0 The seat belt was found unbuckled with no visible damage to the buckle or the latch.\u00a0 The buckle was tested several times and the latch worked perfectly each time.\u00a0 No visible damage was observed to the belt itself and no cutting or scarring was visible.Weather ConditionsThe weather was determined to not be a factor.\u00a0 Clear weather and warmer than normal temperatures were present.\u00a0 No inclement weather was experienced at the time of the accidentTraining and ExperienceReimer was an experienced haul truck operator, having 5 years, 42 weeks, and 6 days of experience; with 42 weeks and 6 days at this mine.\n\u00a0\nTraining records were reviewed by MSHA Education Field Services training specialists Kathy Cattles and Edward C. Edwards.\u00a0 They determined that the training for Reimer was current in accordance with 30 CFR \u00a7 Part 48.\u00a0 Reimer received new task training for the Caterpillar 777B haul truck on July 1, 2013, site specific hazard training on June 27, 2014, and annual refresher training on July 9, 2014.Illumination at Staging and Loading SiteLight plants were readily available but were not in use.\u00a0 During interviews, several of the miners and the safety department stated they preferred the machine lights due to the glare of the light plants.Toxicology Report\u00a0\nA blood ethanol test was performed and revealed Reimer\u2019s ethanol level was 109 mg/dl, which equates to 0.093% blood alcohol content.\u00a0 This is above the legal limit for driving in Wyoming of 0.08% blood alcohol content.\u00a0 An empty pint whiskey bottle was found at the scene near the operator\u2019s compartment.McCoy\u2019s Program of OversightMcCoy\u2019s drug and alcohol policy states, \u201cThe consumption of alcohol or drugs, (even some over the counter medications and prescriptions), can slow reactions, blur vision, reduce the ability to determine distance, and impair judgment.\u00a0 It is, therefore, a violation of our safety policy for any employee to operate a vehicle with illegal drugs in his/her system or while impaired by alcohol, prescription drugs, or over-the-counter medications.\u00a0 You must inform your supervisor if you are taking or using any prescription drug that bears a warning label.\u00a0 Failure to follow this procedure is grounds for reprimand or dismissal.\u201dPrior to the accident, McCoy\u2019s policy included a pre-employment drug test and allowed for unannounced searches for illegal drugs or alcohol while on company property, work sites, facilities, and equipment.\u00a0 The policy allowed for random drug testing any time during the working hours, and included testing for any employee who is involved in an accident.\u00a0 There was no established frequency for these unannounced tests.\u00a0 Any employee who violated this policy was subject to termination.Since the accident, the contractor has contracted with a third party (Gillette Employment Testing, Gillette, WY) to perform computer generated drug and alcohol testing.\u00a0 They randomly test 20% of McCoy employees monthly for drug and alcohol usage.\u00a0 The results of these tests are given to NARM on the 1st and 15th of each month.The spot checks performed by McCoy never indicated that the victim had used illegal drugs or alcohol.\u00a0 On one occasion, the victim\u2019s use of prescription drugs was detected, but he had a valid prescription for the drugs.NARM Program of Oversight of ContractorsPrior to the accident NARM\u2019s policy under section 15.0 Drug and Alcohol Testing, on page 18 of the Contractor Services Agreement booklet stated:The Contractor and all sub-contractors will maintain a drug and alcohol free workplace by instituting and maintaining policies and procedures for pre-employment, random, and post-accident testing that are at least as extensive as the policies and procedures in place at Peabody for mine employees.\u00a0 Failure to comply may result in penalties and work stoppage.\u00a0 All levels of supervisory personnel shall know these policies and procedures.\n\u00a0\nNARM safety personnel discussed the Contractor Service Agreement Booklet with the contractors prior to them working onsite.\u00a0 The contractors were required to initial all areas addressed.\u00a0 This agreement booklet addressed the MSHA Title 30 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), training, equipment, and other areas.\u00a0 The agreement also required a Designated Safety Person to be at the site at all times.\u00a0NARM conducted spot inspections on the contractors, and required the contractors to do random drug/alcohol testing with an independent tester. \u00a0The results had to be provided to NARM on the first and fifteenth of the month.Since the fatal accident, NARM has instituted additional requirements including background checks of the contractor employees.\u00a0 Also, training classes were held in Gillette, Wyoming on November 13, 2014, for contractors to address the drug and alcohol policies, detecting depression, and risk management.\u00a0 Additional bi-monthly training classes in Gillette began on February 4, 2015, for other NARM contractors.\u00a0 This training will be mandatory for the contractors.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "An analysis was conducted to identify the underlying causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 Listed below are root causes identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions implemented to prevent a recurrence of the accident.Root Cause:\u00a0 The drug and alcohol policy of contractor Dennis McCoy & Sons, Inc. was not adequate to prevent noncompliance.\n\u00a0Corrective Action:\u00a0\u00a0The contractor has implemented an enhanced drug and alcohol testing program.\u00a0 Management has implemented more intense hands on monitoring of work activities at all job areas by supervisors. \u00a0This monitoring will be recorded.\nRoot Cause: \u00a0NARM oversight of independent contractor Dennis McCoy & Sons was not sufficient to prevent violation of the drug and alcohol policy.\n\u00a0Corrective

Upon completion of the #659 opening, the push beam and the cutter-head were retracted out of the opening.Between 9:00 and 9:30 a.m., the highwall mining machine was moved over to mine the #660 opening.\u00a0 This opening was mined approximately 400 feet deep.\u00a0 The highwall mining machine operator then retracted the push beams and the cutter-head out of the opening at approximately 3:00 p.m.\u00a0 The entire crew serviced the mining machine, set bits, and greased and adjusted the cutter-head chains in preparation to start the #661 opening.At approximately 3:30 p.m., the #661 opening was started and mining had advanced approximately 70 feet when Cornett, who was operating the highwall mining machine, informed the crew that the right side motor had stopped cutting and the push beams and cutter-head would have to be retreated from the underground opening.\u00a0 When the highwall mining machine was out of the opening, the crew noticed the right side cutter-head chain was missing.\u00a0Newsome, Cornett, A. Cox, Newman, and Sexton gathered at the face of the opening. \u00a0Utilizing a light, they saw the cutter-head chain lying near the right rib approximately 37 feet into the opening.\u00a0 They discussed how to retrieve the chain from the mine opening. \u00a0Cornett asked A. Cox if he was going in the opening to retrieve the chain.\u00a0 A. Cox refused to go, but he told Cornett that Mize would go into the opening to connect to the chain so it could be removed from the opening.\u00a0 While standing at the face of the opening, Cornett, Newsome, Newman, and Sexton were examining the roof when Mize stated to Cornett, Newsome, Newman, and Sexton that he would go into the opening to retrieve the chain.\u00a0 Newsome, Newman, and Sexton insisted that the roof was too bad to go into the opening, but Mize remained firm that he could retrieve the chain.\u00a0 Foreman Cornett and Mize told Sexton to find something that Mize could take into the unsupported opening to connect to the chain so that the chain could be pulled outside.\u00a0 Sexton obtained a chain and straps from a truck nearby.\u00a0 Cornett and Mize tied and taped the chain and straps together and Cornett instructed Sexton to get the loader and have it ready while Mize entered the opening.Cornett was standing at the entrance of the opening when Mize entered the highwall mining machine opening.\u00a0 During the accident investigation interviews, no witness recalled Cornett taking any action to prohibit Mize from entering the unsupported highwall mining machine opening.\u00a0 Approximately ten to fifteen seconds after Mize entered the opening, Cornett heard the roof fall.\u00a0 Cornett shouted out to Mize, but received no response.\u00a0 Cornett traveled into the opening to check on Mize and found that he was covered by the roof fall.\u00a0 Cornett exited the opening and told A. Cox, Newsome, Newman, and Sexton that Mize was covered up and he needed their help to get him out.\u00a0 Cornett instructed them to gather crib blocks, hammers, and a slate bar to help free Mize from the rock.\u00a0 A. Cox, Newsome, and Sexton immediately dispersed to collect the materials while Cornett called 911.\u00a0 Cornett instructed Newman to meet the ambulance at the bottom of the hill.\u00a0 Newsome was fearful and refused to enter the opening.\u00a0 Cornett, A. Cox, and Sexton entered the opening in an attempt to rescue Mize.\u00a0 After reaching Mize\u2019s location, they shouted outside and advised Newsome that they needed more crib blocks and a pneumatic jack to free Mize from beneath the rock. \u00a0Sexton observed the roof of the opening as A. Cox and Cornett worked to free Mize from the fall and bring him outside.\u00a0 Newsome retrieved the materials including a Mine Emergency Technician bag and medical supplies and placed them near the opening for use when Mize was brought outside.Cornett and A.

The persons who participated in the investigation are listed in Appendix A.\u00a0 The persons who were interviewed are listed in Appendix B.", "DISCUSSION": "The mine operator utilizes a Superior Highwall Mining Machine on the surface to penetrate the coal seams and transfer the coal to the surface.\u00a0 At this operation, the highwall mining machine openings created by the mining process are typically 9.5 feet wide, 3 feet high, and up to 400 feet deep.\u00a0 Coal pillars or webs are left between each highwall mining machine opening to support the overburden.\u00a0 At this location of the mine, the coal seams had previously been mined with a 24-inch auger mining machine to a depth of approximately 70 feet.\u00a0 It is not known when these auger holes were mined.\u00a0 The web spacing between the highwall mining machine openings is a minimum of 12.5 feet as specified in the acknowledged Ground Control Plan.\u00a0 The maximum overburden height is 302.5 feet (see pictures in Appendix C).From the facts gathered during the investigation, the highwall mining machine opening where the accident occurred had only been driven 70 feet due to the cutter-head chain breaking. \u00a0The cutter-head chain was located 37 feet from the surface into the opening.\u00a0 Twelve to twenty inches of loose drawrock and cap coal was observed hanging from the roof of the highwall mining machine opening where the accident occurred.\u00a0 Additionally, drawrock was present in the roof of the #659 highwall mining machine opening which was mined earlier in the shift.\u00a0 Drawrock that had already fallen from the roof was also observed on the floor of the #659 highwall mining machine opening.When the victim crawled underground in an attempt to recover the broken cutter-head chain, no roof support or ground support was used.\u00a0 Additionally, no roof support or ground support was used at any time while the foreman and the other two miners were attempting to rescue the victim.\u00a0 At no time was roof support or ground support used to protect the victim or those who recovered the victim.Several miners stated in their interviews that there was no reason to enter the mine opening to retrieve the cutter-head chain because three to four additional cutter head chains were available on mine property at the time of the accident.\u00a0 MSHA accident investigators confirmed these chains were available on mine property.\u00a0 Although the victim should not have entered the mine opening for any reason, because other cutter head chains were available and could have been used, he did not need to enter the mine opening.Management KnowledgeMine management, specifically the foreman, knowingly allowed an employee to enter the highwall mining machine opening to retrieve a cutter-head chain.\u00a0 The foreman also assisted other miners in preparing a chain and straps to connect to the cutter-head chain for retrieval from the opening.\u00a0 Adverse roof conditions in the mine opening in the form of drawrock and cap coal were obvious.\u00a0 Title 30 CFR \u00a7 77.1502 states that no miners are allowed to enter a highwall mining machine opening without a plan approved by the District Manager.\u00a0 Such a plan did not exist at this mine.\u00a0After the accident occurred, the foreman and two other miners entered the highwall mining machine opening to recover the victim without using any type of roof support and without prior approval of the District Manager. \u00a0A non-contributory 104(d)(1) order was issued for a violation of 30 CFR \u00a777.1502 for these miners entering a highwall mining machine opening without a plan approved by the District Manager.Interviews also indicated that there were previous occasions when the crew members associated with the operation of this highwall mining machine had entered mine openings.\u00a0 A. Cox indicated that this was not the first time crew members had entered a highwall mining machine opening to retrieve a chain with the foreman\u2019s knowledge.\u00a0Experience and TrainingMize had 9 years and 26 weeks of mining experience, including 2 years and 31 weeks at this mine and at this work activity.During the accident investigation, MSHA examined the Experienced Miner and Annual Refresher training records of all of the mine operator\u2019s employees including the victim\u2019s training records. \u00a0All training records were found to be current.

Benoit, Mechanic, age 55, was killed while performing maintenance on a forklift in a mill building. Benoit was adjusting the directional solenoid on the transmission from the ground when the forklift began to move forward, pinning him between a wooden support pillar and the forklift\u2019s Falling Object Protective Structure (FOPS).The accident occurred due to management\u2019s failure to ensure that persons performed repairs and maintenance on a forklift with the power turned off and the equipment blocked against hazardous motion. The forklift\u2019s engine was running when the operator left the seat and performed maintenance on the directional solenoid that controls the transmission. Additionally, the parking brake was not set and the wheels were not chocked to prevent movement. The victim was not effectively protected against hazardous motion.", "GENERAL INFORMATION": "Hockley Mine, owned and operated by United Salt Corporation, is a single level room and pillar underground mine located near Hockley, Texas. The principal operating official is Mark F. Wiggins, Mine Manager. Fifty-six persons are employed at the mine. Sixteen persons work underground in two 10 hour shifts per day, 5 days per week. Forty persons work on the surface in three 8-hour shifts per day, 5 days per week. The surface of the mine consists of several buildings including a mill/warehouse (mill building), a maintenance shop, a hoist house, and other offices.Salt is mined by drilling and blasting. Rooms are 60 feet wide and 18 to 20 feet high. Pillars are 90 feet wide and 120 feet long. After blasting, the salt is loaded into a 22 ton haul truck that transports the salt to the primary crusher where it is crushed into four products; coarse salt, medium salt, stock salt, and feed mix salt. The products are stored underground until needed when it is hoisted to the surface and processed in bulk, sacks, or blocks for shipment. During the processing phase, sacked salt and salt blocks can also have additional minerals added prior to packaging. A majority of the salt is shipped in bulk trucks.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on August 28, 2014.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On the day of the accident, September 26, 2014, Mark G. Benoit (victim) clocked in at the mine at 5:50 a.m. Benoit was employed as a surface mechanic and typically inspected the forklifts at the mill building at the beginning of his shift as he did on the day of the accident.At approximately 6:45 a.m., Jose G. Lopez, Mineral Mixer Operator, told Benoit that the forklift he had operated the night before became inoperable and could not travel in either forward or reverse. The forklift was parked on the east side of the mill building, facing east. Benoit walked to the forklift to begin repairs. At approximately 6:50 a.m., he got a can of lubricant from Jose A. Rodriguez, Block Press Operator, who was working nearby. Benoit then was able to tram the forklift in reverse for approximately 86 feet. As he turned the forklift to the south, it became wedged against a wooden support pillar and the forklift stopped. Although the engine was still operating, the machine would not move.Benoit began repair work on the forklift in its wedged position against the wooden pillar. He removed the floorboard to access the directional solenoid attached to the transmission. Benoit stood on the left side of the forklift between the support pillar and the forklift\u2019s FOPS while attempting to change the direction of the forklift by tapping on the solenoid cylinder. When Benoit tapped the cylinder in the forward direction, the forklift moved forward, pinning him between the support pillar and the forklift\u2019s FOPS.Rodriguez was working nearby, heard a noise, and then turned to see Benoit pinned. He attempted to free Benoit but could not move the forklift. Rodriguez left to retrieve another forklift to pull the forklift backwards to free Benoit. He notified Roger Ramirez, Mineral Mixer Operator, of the accident. At approximately 7:08 a.m., Rodriguez and Ramirez pulled the forklift backwards, freeing Benoit.David Gonzales, Mill Supervisor, arrived at 7:10 a.m. and began Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) on the victim with Ramirez assisting. At approximately 7:11 a.m., Gonzalo Perez, Forklift Operator, called 911.At 7:25 a.m., the Waller County EMS arrived and took over the emergency procedures. James Jones, Waller County Supervisor, arrived and pronounced Benoit dead at 7:37 a.m. The cause of death was attributed to blunt trauma to the chest.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "MSHA was notified of the accident at 7:16 a.m. on September 26, 2014, by a telephone call from Mark Wiggins, Plant Manager, to the National Call Center. The Call Center notified Joseph O. Steichen, Assistant District Manager, and an investigation started the same day. To ensure the safety of all persons, an order was issued under provisions of section 103(j) of the Mine Act. This order was later modified to section 103(k) of the Mine Act after the arrival of an Authorized Representative at the mine site.MSHA's accident investigation team traveled to the mine, made a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, reviewed documents and evaluated work procedures relevant to the accident. MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred just south of the block press in the mill building. The mill building has a flat cement floor.Operation ProceduresForklifts are located throughout the mill building. Two Toyota forklifts are primarily used to move pallets of salt. The TCM forklift involved in the accident is used as a backup machine to the other forklifts. Typically, a mechanic inspects all of the forklifts at the beginning of the shift. Equipment operators also conduct a preoperational inspection of a forklift prior to operating it. When a forklift needs any maintenance and can be safely operated, it is driven to the maintenance shop for repairs.ForkliftThe forklift involved in the accident is a TCM model FD30T7. It is a self-propelled, diesel powered, forklift truck with solid rubber tires and is used to move and stack pallets. The machine, manufactured in December 2006, has a maximum travel speed of 12 mph and can lift up to 6,000 lbs.The forklift is equipped with a parking brake and a service brake. The parking brake is controlled by a lever on the dashboard. The forklift has three pedals of standard automotive orientation. From left to right, they are: the clutch or inching pedal, the brake pedal, and the throttle pedal. The forklift has one forward gear and one reverse gear. An electric gear shifter is on the steering column with forward, neutral, and reverse settings.Operational Checks of the ForkliftThe forklift is equipped with a neutral start feature; when the gear selector is in forward or reverse, the forklift engine will not start. At the time of the investigation, once the machine was started and the brakes released, it was found that the forklift moved forward regardless of the setting of the gear shift. The investigators also found that the parking brake was out of adjustment. A noncontributory citation was issued.The investigators determined that tapping on the exposed plunger of the directional control valve allowed the forklift to move in the desired direction. Once the direction was manually changed with this method, the machine moved in this direction regardless of the setting of the gear selector. Additionally, the engine would start in forward or reverse gear after the plunger was manually manipulated, which defeated the neutral start feature. The investigators also found that a 10 amp fuse for the transmission was blown due to the defective solenoid.After a new solenoid operated directional control valve was installed, the forklift moved in the direction the shift lever was set and would not start in gear. The adjustment screw on the parking brake was adjusted and the forklift stayed in place when in neutral on the steepest slope it traversed.The steering and hydraulic controls were tested and functioned properly.Summary of Physical FactorsThe parking brake was out of adjustment. After adjustment, it held on the steepest grade it was used on when the engine was in neutral.\nThe parking brake held the machine in place in reverse but did not hold against the creep function in forward with the engine idle and the service brake released.\nThe solenoid operated directional control valve remained in the last position it was in despite the position of the gear shift.\nThe electrically actuated neutral start interlock verified the position of the gear shifter, not the actual gear setting of the transmission.\nThe solenoid operated directional control valve in the forklift at the time of the accident did not return to center, negating the neutral start feature.\nThe machine functioned properly when the blown fuse and the solenoid operated directional control valve were replaced and the parking brake was adjusted.\nWeatherThe weather on the morning of the accident consisted of clear skies with a temperature of 68\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Weather was not considered to be a factor in the accident.", "TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE": "Benoit had approximately 1 year and 49 weeks of mining experience all at this mine. A representative of MSHA's Educational Field Services staff conducted a review of the mine operator's training plan and records. The required training for Benoit was up to date and in compliance with 30 CFR Part 48 requirements.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "The investigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified the following root cause:Root Cause:\u00a0The accident occurred due to management\u2019s failure to ensure that persons performed repairs and maintenance on a forklift with the power turned off and the equipment blocked against hazardous motion. The unblocked forklift exposed the victim to hazards associated with the potential movement of the machine.Corrective Action:\u00a0Management developed safe work procedures for blocking mobile equipment against hazardous motion before persons perform maintenance. Miners were tasked trained to follow these new procedures.", "CONCLUSION": "The accident occurred due to management\u2019s failure to ensure that persons performed repairs and maintenance on a forklift with the power turned off and the equipment blocked against hazardous motion. The forklift\u2019s engine was running when the operator left the seat and performed maintenance on the directional solenoid that controls the transmission. Additionally, the parking brake was not set and the wheels were not chocked to prevent movement. The victim was not effectively protected against hazardous motion.", "ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS": "Issued to United Salt CorporationOrder No. 6315046\u00a0- issued on September 26, 2014, under the provisions of section 103(j) of the Mine Act:An accident occurred at this operation on 09/26/2014 at approximately 7:10 a.m. This order is being issued, under section 103(j) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, to assure the safety of all persons at this operation.

2014, was in progress when the accident occurred.\u00a0 The Non-Fatal Days Lost (NFDL) injury incident rate for the mine operator in 2013 was 5.71, compared to the National NFDL rate of 3.25 for mines of this type.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "Andrian Kyle Abetya, Midnight Shift Supervisor, was provided a list of those miners reassigned to his shift, and Ramirez was on that list.\u00a0 Based on Ramirez\u2019s previous work during longwall extractions, he was assigned to David Lee Montoya, Longwall Support Supervisor, to operate the a Wagner ST-2DS (Wagner), No. 24-43 can setter, parked in the number two entry of the B Canyon Mains at crosscut No. 11. \u00a0This is the intake access into the two entry longwall panel designated as 23rd East, 004-0 MMU (see Appendix A).At 12:26 a.m., Ramirez called Montoya, advising him that water was needed for the exhaust scrubber on the Wagner.\u00a0 No other problems with the machine were relayed to Montoya.\u00a0 At approximately 1:22 a.m., Jesse Egbert, Equipment Operator, drove a Tamrock 980L utility tractor and trailer into 23rd East from the B Canyon Mains with instructions to pick up expended utilities and pipe. \u00a0The Wagner was blocking the entry one crosscut inby the corner.\u00a0 Egbert honked the horn on the 980L tractor, but received no response.\u00a0 About the same time, coming outby from 23rd East, Hamilton and Leon were in an Isuzu pick-up truck, also blocked by the Wagner.Egbert parked the 980L tractor and walked past the Wagner to the Isuzu pick-up.\u00a0 Egbert noticed the Wagner was idling. \u00a0Egbert did not see Ramirez when he passed on the off side of the Wagner. \u00a0Egbert asked Hamilton and Leon if they knew where Ramirez was. \u00a0Both Leon and Hamilton stated they had seen Ramirez moving a pallet into the storage entry earlier, but had not had contact with him since then.At 1:28 a.m., Hamilton tried to call Ramirez on the mine wide phone system and received no response. \u00a0At about the same time, Egbert and Leon both noted a light shining under the Wagner and went to investigate. \u00a0They found Ramirez in the articulation pinch point area, at the operator\u2019s compartment entrance, with the machine pivoted in the closed position. \u00a0Ramirez was observed partially out of the cab with his torso outside the machine frame.At 1:30 a.m., Egbert called Abetya, while Leon ran into the section and notified Montoya that Ramirez was injured in the Wagner. \u00a0Abetya contacted Kim Ward, Conspec (atmospheric monitoring system) Operator, while driving to the accident scene.\u00a0 Ward was instructed to contact the ambulance service and mine management that a serious accident had occurred.\u00a0 Ward contacted East Carbon ambulance and East Carbon police at 1:36 a.m.\u00a0 Sargent Phillip Holt, East Carbon police, arrived at 1:53 a.m. at approximately the same time as the ambulance.Leon and Montoya both ran outby from crosscut No. 4 to the Wagner.\u00a0 Hamilton was instructed to support Ramirez\u2019s upper body. \u00a0Montoya could not reach the steering control from the operator\u2019s access side so he went to the front of the machine and reached into the front canopy opening and articulated the Wagner open. \u00a0The articulation released Ramirez\u2019 body from the pinch point and Hamilton, Egbert, and Leon placed him on the mine floor. \u00a0Hamilton returned into the 23rd East section and retrieved the section first aid kit, stretcher, and Automated External Defibrillator (AED). \u00a0Abetya arrived at this time and no vitals were detected. \u00a0Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), was started immediately.\u00a0 The AED advised that no shock be given.CPR was continued from the underground accident scene to the surface. \u00a0Shortly after reaching the surface, care of Ramirez was turned over to the paramedics when they arrived on-site at 2:03 a.m. \u00a0CPR was halted when no vital signs could be detected.\u00a0 Carbon County Sheriff, Sergeant David Brewer, acting in his capacity as Carbon County Medical Examiner, arrived at 2:52 a.m. and determined a time of death of 1:34 a.m., based on information he received regarding the time Ramirez was recovered.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "MSHA was notified at 2:14 a.m. \u00a0A technical problem with the MSHA Call Center prevented the mine operator from being able to inform MSHA of this accident within 15 minutes.\u00a0 Peter Saint, Electrical Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, verbally issued a 103(j) order at 2:35 a.m. to the mine operator.Saint notified James Preece, Acting Assistant District Manager, and Donald Durrant, Price Field Office Supervisor, who notified Vernon Marvidikis, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, of the accident.Durrant and Marvidikis arrived at the mine at approximately 5:30 a.m. \u00a0Upon arrival, Durrant modified the 103(j) order to a 103(k) order to insure the safety of all persons during the accident investigation and to preserve all evidence at the accident scene. \u00a0The investigation was conducted in cooperation with the Utah State Labor Commission, Office of Coal Mine Safety. \u00a0Interviews were conducted with persons considered to have knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident. \u00a0The accident area was surveyed with the mine engineering staff. \u00a0A list of the persons who participated in the investigation is contained in Appendix B.", "DISCUSSION": "Accident Location23rd East is a two entry longwall headgate with conveyor belt entries.\u00a0 Local geology showed an average seam thickness of 96 inches.\u00a0 The seam had a 13 percent grade with the machine articulated upgrade.\u00a0 The roof, rib, and floor conditions did not contribute to the accident.The pallets being handled by Ramirez held 44 crib blocks, which were eight by eight by thirty-six inches, with two pallets setting on the lower rib outby the front of the Wagner.\u00a0 The Wagner that Ramirez was operating when the accident occurred had lift forks installed so it could remove pallets of cribs delivered to the No. 11 crosscut in the B Canyon mains.\u00a0 The pallets were stored between the ventilation stopping at the head roller of the 23rd East longwall belt and intake access.Wagner ST-2DS Scooptram Load-Haul-Dump (LHD) Loader with Can Setter\nThe Wagner ST-2DS Scooptram load-haul-dump (LHD) unit was manufactured in 1989.\u00a0 The Wagner was purchased as a used LHD in 2003 with two other ST-2DS\u2019s.\u00a0 In 2007, West Ridge applied for and was granted a field modification for the Wagner to have greater versatility in mine production work. \u00a0It was originally equipped with a 2-yard ejector bucket, which had a hydraulically movable plate that pushes material out of the bucket.Behind the longwall face, the mine installed secondary roof supports called \u201ccans.\u201d\u00a0 These were mild steel cylinders filled with an air-entrained concrete. \u00a0Cans were manufactured in 18, 24, or 36-inch diameters, and of the length necessary to match the entry height. \u00a0The Wagner had equipment that would pick-up cans, carry them to the installation site, rotate to vertical, and set the can in place. \u00a0Miners then secured each can in place with caps and wedges. \u00a0West Ridge adapted the Wagner with a bulk paper roll lifting clamp that was suited for the can installation requirements, made by Cascade Clamp, Mfg.The third modification option for the Wagner was a set of lift forks similar to the forks on a forklift. \u00a0Prior to the accident, can setting was finished and pallets of crib block were brought into the longwall as additional roof support where cans could not be installed. \u00a0The Wagner was in this configuration at the time of the accident.The Wagner consisted of two major sections with an articulation joint between them.\u00a0 The front section included the can setter, forks or a 2-yard bucket, lift boom, hydraulic cylinders, front drive axle, and operator's compartment.\u00a0 The rear section included the engine, torque converter, transmission, rear drive axle, exhaust scrubber and fire suppression system.\u00a0This four-wheel drive LHD was powered by a Caterpillar 3304 PCNA, diesel engine, with a four-speed transmission for both the forward and reverse directions.\u00a0 Fourth gear was blocked out.The LHD was equipped with an air actuated, hydraulic braking system at each wheel, applied with an air treadle valve mounted at the foot pedal.\u00a0 There was a second braking system for emergency and parking brakes. \u00a0This system was spring applied and hydraulically released.\u00a0 It had multiple wet discs and was built into the transmission.The weekly examination for the LHD, required under 30 CFR \u00a7 75.1914(f), was completed at approximately 9:00 a.m. on September 15, 2014, without any defects or hazardous conditions noted.Accident investigators found the Wagner\u2019s transmission forward/reverse control arm in the neutral position, the gear selector in the \u201cfirst\u201d gear position, the park brake set, and the headlight switch in the \"rear on\" position.Machine's Operator CompartmentThe operator's seat and compartment was oriented on the left side of the machine, adjacent to the forward wheel assembly.\u00a0 The operator sat perpendicular to the direction of travel in a semi-reclined position, and looked left for forward travel, and looked right when traveling in reverse.\u00a0 There was no door on the operator's compartment side access which was open to the articulation area.\u00a0 The Wagner was not provided with a restraint system that would keep the operator within the confines of the operator\u2019s compartment.\u00a0 It is not known why the victim was partially outside of the operator\u2019s compartment.All hydraulic controls were mounted within the compartment for steering, boom control, and can setter control.\u00a0 After the modification, the boom lift and bucket levers operated similar functions for the can setter clamp.\u00a0 Additional levers operated the rotation and clamping of the can setter.\u00a0 All were readily accessible.\u00a0A manual park brake release was included in the operator\u2019s compartment.\u00a0The operational gauges, air toggle lever, system override, diesel motor air start buttons, brake release, and a hand held fire extinguisher, were mounted on the rear section at arm\u2019s length.\u00a0 All gauges functioned as required.\u00a0 The certified canopy was adjusted to its lowest setting, restricting the operator\u2019s view to the rear.The service brake pedal was located to the left of the throttle pedal in standard automotive orientation.\u00a0 Both pedals were tested and moved freely.\u00a0 Spring returned them when released without obstruction.\u00a0The steering was controlled by a \u00bd inch \u201cMono Control\u201d joystick type rod with a plastic knob threaded on its end that traveled up or down in a slotted guard.\u00a0 The joystick was spring-centered and caused right and left machine articulation movement with the speed of articulation being proportional to the lever displacement and motor speed.\u00a0 With the joystick in the down position, the Wagner turned left in forward travel.\u00a0A hinged, forked mechanical steering lock was added to the joystick guard. \u00a0Its intent was to hold the joystick in the centered position.Equipment TestingTo complete the site investigation, the Wagner involved in the accident was inspected to facilitate function testing. \u00a0Multiple machine mechanical and safety deficiencies required repairing, before the Wagner could be tested.Once repaired for testing, the machine was able to articulate fully to the left as it did in the accident. To articulate, the machine had to overcome the fact that the park brake was set, friction from contact with the mine floor, and turn up hill against the 13 percent grade. \u00a0The Wagner was articulated to the left multiple times to show the positon and closure necessary to simulate the condition that occurred during the accident.\u00a0 It took an average of 28 seconds to close to the steering stops. \u00a0The gap between the operator\u2019s compartment frame to the water tank frame, when fully articulated to the left to the steering stops, measured 3 \u00bd inches (see Appendix C).At some point in time, after original manufacturing and prior to West Ridge\u2019s purchase, metal blocks were added to the original steering stops at the articulation frame that increased the closure distance between frames, so that a miner could potentially not be crushed if his body was in the articulation area. The off side steering stop plate was measured at 4 \u00bc inch long by 2 \u00bc inches wide and estimated to be \u00bd inch thick.\u00a0 When examined, the operator\u2019s side forward steering stop was missing.\u00a0 This allowed the closure, frame to frame, at the pinch point where the victim became entrapped.\u00a0 These steering stops were not original to the machine when manufactured (see Appendix C).After testing was completed, the Wagner was determined to be unsafe to drive out of the mine and that it needed to be towed.\u00a0 Both Wagner LHDs were removed from the 23rd West sections and were taken to and secured in the mine\u2019s surface shop.\u00a0 Gary Clark, Mechanical Engineer MSHA Approval and Certification Center, and Dwayne Brown, Coal Mine Safety and Health Diesel Specialist, inspected both operating Wagner LHD\u2019s using the Wagner/Atlas Copco inspection criteria.When examined immediately during the accident investigation, the following defects were found;The inspection/access cover on the side of the fuel tank was leaking diesel fuel. Diesel fuel was dripping from the machine onto the mine floor.\n \nThe fork lift attachment keeper pin was not installed.\u00a0 The pin was sitting in front of the operator\u2019s compartment.\n \nThe manual park brake release system would not pump up and manually release the brakes with the engine not running. \u00a0The park brake tow valve did not automatically return to the park brake applied position when released as required by the equipment manufacturer.\n \nThe high engine temperature shutdown valve did not shut the machine\u2019s engine down at 212 degrees or lower.\n \nThe low scrubber water shutdown level did not shut the machine\u2019s engine down at the proper level.\n \nThe low engine oil pressure shutdown system did not function properly when tested.\n \nIn addition to the safety defects, accumulations of combustible materials in the form of coal, coal fines, oil, diesel fuel, oil and diesel fuel soaked coal had been allowed to accumulate on the Wagner.\u00a0 When examined, oil and oil soaked coal covered the main hydraulic tank, front and side of the transmission, and the boom and front frame of the machine.\u00a0 Diesel fuel and fuel soaked coal, approximately 1 inch in depth, was on and around the machine\u2019s diesel fuel tank.\u00a0 A puddle of diesel fuel was noticed under the machine.\n \nA primary defect directly related to the accident was found with the steering control joystick. \u00a0Due to the loss of the original plastic steering knob, a modified handle assembly was made.\u00a0 This improvisation consisted of adding at the \u00bd inch threaded end of the control rod a \u00bd to \u215c inch pipe bell reducer.\u00a0 Inserted into the \u00bd inch end of the pipe bell reducer was a \u215d inch eye or ring type lift bolt.\u00a0 Since the threads didn\u2019t match, electrical tape was wrapped around the control rod and attachments to hold everything in place.\u00a0 When removed, the control rod, eye bolt, pipe fitting, and tape weighed 15.2 ounces.\u00a0 The Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) knob weighed about 1 ounce.\u00a0 As the handle assembly loosened, more tape was wrapped until it was 1.315 inch in diameter, (0.77 inch wider than the steering interlock), and extended from in the guard plate slot to the base of the ring.\u00a0 The addition of multiple layers of tape created a frictional contact with the guard which, when combined with the added weight of the assembly, held the steering Mono Control rod down in the left articulating position.\n \nThe operator\u2019s side forward steering stop was missing.\nMSHA\u2019s specialists determined the numerous violative conditions on the Wagner were obvious and had, with a high degree of probability, been in place prior to when the accident occurred.West Ridge Equipment ExaminationsWest Ridge mine maintenance personnel received their initial 30 CFR \u00a7 75.1915(a) diesel certification training off site from Randy Tatton,\u00a0owner of Mining Health and Safety Solutions, Inc.\u00a0 Mine specific, follow-up training was completed by the mechanics during an on the job training (OJT) period.\u00a0 The West Ridge training utilized Wagner and Atlas Copco examination check off sheets as training materials, (Atlas Copco purchased Wagner Mfg.).\u00a0 Once trained, mechanics were assigned specific diesel equipment for the required the 30 CFR \u00a7 75.1915(f) inspections.\u00a0 A review of diesel mechanic training records indicated the training was completed for those mechanics currently assigned to repair and perform 30 CFR \u00a7 75.1914(f) examinations and tests of the diesel fleet operating at West Ridge Mine.On September 15th at approximately 9:00 a.m., Richard Evans, Certified Diesel Mechanic, was assisting Darren Bradley, Certified Diesel Mechanic, with the changing of a carrier bearing on the second Wagner ST-2DS can setter, company number 5.\u00a0 The second can setter was in the face area of the 23rd West.\u00a0 The Wagner involved in the accident, number 24-43, was being operated as a fork lift in the same area.\u00a0 Evans stated he was assigned to the 24-43 Wagner for weekly examinations.\u00a0 When Evans saw the 24-43 unit operating near the #5 Wagner, he stopped it and performed the required 30 CFR \u00a7 75.1914(f) examination for the week.\u00a0 During the interview of Evans, he stated that he did not see anything out of order on the 24-43 Wagner and recorded this in the weekly diesel record.\u00a0 That examination was later recorded in the mine\u2019s weekly diesel examination record as \u201cok.\u201d\u00a0 Accident investigators reviewed weekly permissibility records back to August 24, 2014, and found that the only defects noted were fire suppression caps being replaced and the scrubber being shut down so that adjustments could be made.Company policy required Wagner operators to conduct a pre-operational examinations to comply with 30 CFR \u00a7 75.1914(e). \u00a0The company directed examiners to fill out a company provided examination card which would show the operating condition of the Wagner.\u00a0 Once examined, the pre-operational examination card was forwarded to management. \u00a0For each shift, one of these cards should have been filled out for the Wagner that was operated.West Ridge miners randomly submitted these examination cards.\u00a0 The records of these pre-operational examinations were not comprehensive for the shifts that Wagners were operated.\u00a0 The accident investigation team reviewed the previous six months of Wagner pre-operational examination records, (March to September 2014), including those done by Ramirez.\u00a0 Those records that were available for review generally did not contain defects listed that affected safety.During the two shifts prior to the accident, the 24-43 Wagner was used to handle pallets at the same location Ramirez was assigned.\u00a0 Pre-operational examination cards, filled out on the day shift and swing shift on September 15th, by mobile equipment operators Josh Patterson and Zeb Farmer, showed no defects on the machine.The mine operator\u2019s preventative maintenance of the diesel equipment at this mine lacked comprehensive oversight.\u00a0 When asked how long the steering rod had not been maintained, as described above, Travis Graves, Maintenance Manager, and Evans the diesel mechanic assigned to conduct weekly examinations on the Wagner, stated they did not know.\u00a0 When asked if they could remember the modified handle assembly ever not being on the steering rod, they both replied \u201cNo.\u201dThe Wagner non-compliance should have been obvious to a trained examiner.\u00a0 The observations of accident investigators showed that this mobile diesel equipment, continuously operated in a mining environment, was not maintained as well as the pre-operational examination cards and weekly permissibility records indicated.\u00a0 The defects found were both contributory and non-contributory to the accident. \u00a0Both Wagner can setters required several days of repair work, underground and in the surface shop, to make them compliant with 30 CFR \u00a7 75.1914.Work Experience and TrainingAlejandro Ramirez (victim) was employed as an experienced miner from Price Mine Services in 2007. His resume states he had \u201cQualifications\u201d as, among other jobs, a \u201cCan Setter.\u201d\u00a0 Ramirez initially worked at the mine before it became West Ridge in August 2008.\u00a0 He received initial training on the Wagner ST-2DS on May 5, 2007, with training performed by Randy Hunt, Foreman.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nAt West Ridge, Ramirez received additional task training in longwall recovery support activities in 2013 and twice in 2014.\u00a0 This included training on installing roof support for shield extraction, and equipment operations related to the longwall mining machine removal and installation.From March 2009 through September 2014, West Ridge moved their longwall mining machine 14 times.

The mine has 37 employees, and operates two 10-hour shifts (6:00 am to 4:00 pm and 4:00 pm to 2:00 am), Monday through Friday.The mine has one active pit. The mine is a surface bituminous coal operation, utilizing typical drill and shoot methods to break the overburden. This operation utilizes a Hitachi 1200 Excavator and two Caterpillar 992C front-end loaders to remove the overburden. The highwall in the area of the accident ranges from 50 to 60 feet in height. Once the overburden is removed, the coal seams are excavated utilizing front-end loaders and coal haulage trucks. The primary coal seams mined are the Jefferson and Lick Creek seams, averaging a total of approximately 28 inches in thickness. The daily production averages 840 tons.The principal officials of the mine at the time of the accident were:The principal officials for the mine at the time of the accident were:Roger W.

Duncan (victim) arrived at the mine for the day shift at approximately 5:00 am and traveled directly to his work area. Duncan was assigned to continue completion of a drill bench which he had been working on his prior shift.Duncan\u2019s method for creating the bench was to push material to the edge of the bench, in effect creating a berm, which kept his bulldozer from getting close to the highwall edge. He continued to push material to the edge of the bench, keeping a berm, while also pushing material off the bench into the pit. Typically, Duncan moved his bulldozer perpendicular to the edge of the highwall while he was pushing the material.As the remainder of the day shift employees arrived and throughout the day, Duncan carried on small talk over the citizen\u2019s band (CB) radio with the other equipment operators. Some of the other equipment operators observed Duncan working on the bench throughout the shift, but never observed anything unusual.At approximately 12:40 p.m., the bulldozer operated by Duncan traveled over the highwall and fell approximately 50 feet to the Jefferson bench below. The bulldozer came to rest in the upright position. Johnnie Turner, Excavator Operator, noticed a cloud of dust in the area where Duncan was working and attempted to call Duncan over the CB radio several times with no response. Turner then called over the CB for mine personnel to investigate.Barry Gilbreath, Rock Truck Operator, was the first to arrive at the accident scene. He found the victim on the floor of the bulldozer cab, not wearing his seatbelt, with his head face down in the operator\u2019s seat, unresponsive, and without vital signs. B.J. Myers and Gary Benson, Rock Truck Operators, arrived and started CPR. The coworkers called for medical assistance.First responders from the Thach Volunteer Fire Department relieved mine personnel and continued CPR on the victim. An Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) was attached to the victim and indicated that the first responders should continue with CPR. Regional Paramedics of Jasper arrived and continued the efforts to revive the victim. The paramedics applied an electrocardiogram (EKG) and determined that there were no vital signs. Efforts to revive the victim were stopped and the coroner was called.J.C. Poe, Walker County Coroner, arrived and pronounced the victim dead at 2:04 pm, September 15, 2014.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "At approximately 12:50 pm, Jerry Aaron, Mine Superintendent, notified Coal Mine Inspector, Dean Harbin, of the accident. Harbin was conducting an inspection on mine property at the time of the accident. Harbin met Aaron at the accident scene. Harbin issued a 103(k) order to ensure the safety of all persons and to prevent the destruction of evidence during the accident investigation. Harbin called Jacky Shubert, Bessemer Field Office Supervisor, and advised him of the accident. Shubert replied that he would send an MSHA accident investigator to conduct the investigation. Bessemer Field Office Supervisor, Ed Boylen and Coal Mine Inspector, James Brodeur were dispatched to the mine. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) Call Center was notified of the accident at approximately 1:24 pm, on Monday, September 15, 2014, when Aaron placed the call.Harbin conducted a preliminary examination of the accident scene. Photographs and observations were made of the bulldozer\u2019s route of travel, resting place at the bottom of highwall, and the general condition of the highwall. Boylen and Brodeur arrived on site, began an investigation, and conducted initial interviews with mine employees. A physical examination of the Caterpillar D9L Bulldozer, company number 2 was conducted by Harbin and Brodeur.The investigation was conducted in conjunction with the State of Alabama Department of Labor Inspections Division, Thompson Tractor Company Service Department, mine management, and employees from the mine. Those persons participating in the investigation are listed in Appendix A. Persons interviewed are listed in the Appendix B.The investigation of the physical site of the accident was completed on September 17, 2014. Digital photographs, sketches, and relevant measurements, including a topographic survey of the accident area prepared by Perc Engineering Company, were developed as part of the investigation. The topographic survey is shown in Appendix C. The investigation also included a review of training records, mine and equipment and mine examinations records, and maintenance records. Additional interviews were conducted with persons who had knowledge of the accident on September 16 and 30, 2014. The interviews revealed that there were no eyewitnesses to the accident.The physical examination and function tests performed on the Caterpillar Bulldozer were completed on September 30, 2014. Operational pressure tests for machine speed, brakes, and steering were performed by Morris Campbell, Thompson Tractor Company Service Technician. Thompson Tractor Company, Inc., the regional Caterpillar distributer, is contracted by the mine to provide mine site service and maintenance support of the mine\u2019s equipment.", "DISCUSSION": "Accident Site ObservationsThe accident scene consisted of a highwall in which the upper bench was being prepared for the drilling phase of the mining cycle. The lower pit level had already been mined. The highwall measured 55 feet in the area where the bulldozer traveled off the highwall. There were no cracks in the bench floor or areas where the highwall had broken. The inspection of the highwall revealed no evidence of ground failure. The weather conditions did not contribute to the accident. The day was a mostly cloudy with a temperature of 84 degrees Fahrenheit (\u00b0F). The bench area was dry.The upper level of the highwall was in the construction phase. The investigation showed that normal mining practices were used in clearing and leveling the bench for drilling. A portion of the berm was not left on the edge of the bench, which was the area where the bulldozer traveled over the highwall.On the push by the bulldozer when the accident occurred, there was a gouge in the bench floor close to the edge of the highwall. The bulldozer blade was dropped down when it should have been level or been raised prior to the bulldozer backing up for another push. The last push was the only location on the bench that showed evidence of this occurrence and was a change in the method of bulldozer\u2019s operation during the last push, as compared to the rest of the bench.EquipmentThe bulldozer was a Caterpillar D9L Bulldozer, serial no. 14Y3133. The bulldozer weighs approximately 126,600 pounds and has a turbocharged 12-cylinder engine with approximately 460 horsepower at the flywheel. The bulldozer has three forward gears and three reverse gears. The speed of the bulldozer going forward is as follows: 2.5 miles per hour (mph) in first gear, 4.5 mph in second gear, and 7.5 mph in third gear. The speed of the bulldozer going in reverse is as follows: 3.1 mph in first gear, 5.4 mph in second gear and 9.3 mph in third gear. The bulldozer was in neutral with the engine running when coworkers arrived at the accident site.The bulldozer is equipped with Roll-Over Protective Structure (ROPS). Although there were no eye witnesses to the accident, the post-accident condition of the bulldozer showed evidence of a rollover. There was damage to the exhaust stack, air pre-breather, lights around the cab, and dents in the cab frame. All windows were either broken out or damaged, and dirt was impacted inside of the operator\u2019s cab. Additionally, the seat belt in the bulldozer was in the retracted position and was partially covered with dirt. There was no evidence to indicate that the victim was wearing the seat belt at the time of the accident.Pre-operational Equipment Checks and MaintenanceThe mine operator requires that a pre-operational check list be filled out by all equipment operators on every shift. All pre-operational check lists for the two weeks prior to the accident were reviewed. There were no hazards or problems reported for the bulldozer. During the investigation of the accident site and bulldozer, the bulldozer pre-operational check record for Monday, September 15, 2014 could not be located. There were no mechanical problems with the bulldozer listed in any record that was reviewed.A review was conducted of approximately the previous six months of the service/repair records for the bulldozer involved in the accident, and there was no evidence of any hazards or problems.Field Testing of BulldozerThere were no problems identified with the bulldozer steering, brakes, transmission, or engine decelerator control system. This bulldozer model had no electronic control module which would store diagnostic information. Manual diagnostic tests were performed by a service technician of Thompson Tractor Company, Inc. Pressure gauges were connected to the bulldozer ports to test the oil pressures of the speed clutch, forward and reverse direction clutches, brake pedal, left and right brake levers, and left and right steering clutch levers. Test results are attached in Appendix D. There was no evidence that an operational issue existed with the bulldozer at the time of the accident.Work Experience and TrainingThe victim was an experienced bulldozer operator, having approximately 28 years of mining experience, with 15 years at this mine (see Appendix E).An examination of training records revealed Duncan received required training in accordance with 30 CFR Part 48. Duncan received annual refresher training on May 10, 2014. Duncan received task training for a D9L bulldozer in 2002.Additional InformationThe Walker County Coroner listed the cause of death on the Alabama Certificate of Death as blunt force open head trauma due to a mining accident. No autopsy was performed on the victim.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "A root cause analysis was conducted to identify the most basic causes of the accident, which could have been corrected through reasonable management controls. The following root causes, if corrected, could have prevented the accident or mitigated the outcome:Root Cause:\u00a0The mine operator failed to ensure that the bulldozer operator maintained full control of his machine while in motion and while working in close proximity to the edge of an existing highwall.Corrective Action:\u00a0The mine operator retrained all personnel on maintaining full control of their machine at all times and on the proper techniques of preventing over travel of a highwall or any areas of the mine where the machine may fall and/or turnover. A record of the training conducted was provided to MSHA.Root Cause:\u00a0The mine operator failed to ensure that seatbelts were used where there is a danger of overturning equipment.Corrective Action:\u00a0The mine operator retrained all personnel on wearing the machine\u2019s seat belt at all times where there is a danger of overturning equipment when the machine is in motion. A record of the training conducted was provided to MSHA.", "CONCLUSION": "The accident occurred because the bulldozer operator failed to maintain full control of his equipment while it was in motion in close proximity to the edge of an existing highwall.

Most of the miners work on dayshift from 7:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. while a 3-person night shift works from 3:45 p.m. to 1:15 a.m.Limestone is drilled and blasted from a multiple-bench quarry. A front-end loader is used to load a haul truck which transports the broken limestone to a primary feed hopper for processing. The primary crushing plant consists of a grizzly-type vibrating feeder and a jaw crusher with an under jaw discharge conveyor. The crushed material is conveyed to a scalping screen. The undersized material flows to a conveyor and the oversized material falls into a cone crusher at the secondary plant for additional crushing. When the material exits the secondary plant, it is conveyed to the mill for further reduction. The material is stored in bulk or dried for subsequent bagging. Finished products are sold as bulk or bagged agricultural lime.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this mine on July 23, 2014.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On the day of the accident, Monday August 25, 2014, Glenn F. Dibble (G. Dibble, victim) reported for work at 7:30 a.m., his usual starting time. G. Dibble was instructed by Kevin Dibble (K. Dibble), Plant Manager, to haul five to six loads of sand from a nearby mine. During the morning, coworkers observed G. Dibble hauling several loads of material in an over-the-road dump truck.At approximately 12:30 p.m., Murlyn Harris, Front-end Loader Operator, loaded G. Dibble\u2019s truck with crusher run material to be delivered off site.At about 2:00 p.m., the secondary crushing plant shut down with a full load of material in the cone crusher. The cone crusher needed to be emptied before the plant could be restarted. Derek Collier, Crusher Operator, Jeff Jenkins, Plant Operator/Shift Supervisor, and Harris decided to use chains and slings connected to a front-end loader in an attempt to lift the crusher and allow material to flow through.At approximately 3:00 p.m., Harris observed G. Dibble return to the mine and park his dump truck. About 3:15 p.m., G. Dibble stopped by to assist with the work on the cone crusher. G. Dibble stated that they would need several wooden planks to prevent material from flowing from the stone hopper into the crusher. G. Dibble then stated that he knew where the planks were and left in a pickup truck and traveled toward the bag storage building.At 3:45 p.m., the 3-person nightshift crew gathered in the breakroom, punched their timecards, and traveled to the milling plant. The crew consisted of two bagging machine operators and an operator/machine tender.When the work on the cone crusher was completed, Collier, Jenkins, and Harris went to the breakroom to punch out for the shift. Harris noticed that G. Dibble had not returned and assumed that K. Dibble had sent him on some errands. The dayshift crew left the mine at 4:00 p.m.On Tuesday, August 26, 2014, at 1:25 a.m., the nightshift crew returned to the breakroom at the end of the shift. At that time, they noticed that G. Dibble\u2019s motorcycle helmet was on the table in the breakroom. Darren House, Bagger, looked outside and saw that G. Dibble\u2019s motorcycle was parked behind the breakroom. Nicholas Trapp, Bagger, noticed that the pickup truck was not parked near the shop as it normally was during nightshift. At that time, Steven Spano, Operator/Machine Tender, checked G. Dibble\u2019s timecard and noticed he had not punched out at the end of dayshift. According to interviews, they assumed G. Dibble\u2019s motorcycle did not start and he had taken the pickup truck home. The nightshift crew left the mine at 1:45 a.m.Harris arrived at the mine at 5:12 a.m. and waited in the breakroom for the rest of the dayshift crew to arrive. While waiting, he noticed G. Dibble\u2019s motorcycle helmet was still on the table in the breakroom. At 6:00 a.m., Harris and Collier punched their time cards and decided to look for G. Dibble. They saw the pickup truck sitting near the bag storage building, went inside, and found G. Dibble lying between two loaded pallets. He was unresponsive and had no vital signs. They immediately called the local authorities and K. Dibble to report the accident. The New York State Police and the St. Lawrence County Coroner responded to the mine. At 7:30 a.m., the victim was pronounced dead at the scene by Kevin Crosby, St. Lawrence County Coroner. The cause of death was attributed to blunt force trauma.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "MSHA was notified of the accident at 6:19 a.m. on August 26, 2014, by a telephone call from Derek Collier, Crusher Operator, to the National Call Center. The National Call Center notified Victor Lescznske, Supervisory Special Investigator, and an investigation was started the same day. An order was issued under provisions of Section 103(j) of the Mine Act. This order was later modified to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act after the arrival of an Authorized Representative at the mine site.MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident. MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management, employees, and state law enforcement.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred in the bag storage building on the east end of the mine. The structure is a three-sided enclosure built to store and shelter stacked pallets of new bags and other materials needed for the mine (see Figure 1). The earthen floor is covered with fine gravel and free of debris. Wire mesh bag support columns for the onsite dust collectors and wooden planks are stored in the building\u2019s rafters approximately 12 feet from ground level.WeatherOn the day of the accident, weather conditions were clear with an average temperature of 80 degrees Fahrenheit and wind approximately 6 mph. Sunrise was at 6:18 a.m. The investigators determined that the weather conditions and lighting were not contributing factors in the accident.Physical FactorsThe evidence gathered during the investigation indicated that the victim had climbed approximately 8 feet on top of two stacked pallets and reached for wooden planks in the rafters above him (see Figures 2 and 3). Each wooden plank was approximately 2 inches thick by 12-inches wide by 12 feet long and weighed 30 pounds. The victim had taken down two wooden planks before falling to the ground.", "TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE": "Glenn Dibble had 1\u00bd years of mining experience as a truck driver, all at this mine. A representative of MSHA's Educational Field Services reviewed the mine operator\u2019s Part 46 training records for G. Dibble. Although the records documented that G. Dibble had received all required training, including task training and annual refresher training, he did not receive task training addressing safe work procedures for accessing overhead areas and the potential hazards associated with the task.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "Root Cause:\u00a0Management failed to provide a safe means of access for miners retrieving stored materials from the overhead rafters in the bag storage building.Corrective Action:\u00a0All materials were removed from the overhead rafters and stored in a safe manner. In addition, management established written policies and safe work procedures, including the use of ladders for any work being performed overhead. Miners were trained in the new policies and procedures.Root Cause:\u00a0Management failed to provide the victim, an over-the-road truck driver, sufficient task training addressing safe access and safe work procedures while performing additional duties at the mine.Corrective Action:\u00a0Management has revised their Part 46 training plan to include task training for over-the-road truckers who may perform additional duties at the mine. All truck drivers were trained in accordance with the revised plan.", "CONCLUSION": "The accident occurred due to management\u2019s failure to establish and implement procedures for persons to safely access materials stored in the bag storage building. Additionally, G. Dibble did not receive task training addressing safe work procedures for accessing overhead areas and the potential hazards associated with the task.", "ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS": "Issued to Gardenscape of New YorkOrder No. 8802348\u00a0- Issued on August 26, 2014, under the provisions of Section 103(j) of the Mine Act.

the Pocahontas No. 3 Seam.\u00a0 The seam averages 6 feet in height.\u00a0 Four fans exhausting 2.4 million cubic feet of air per minute provide ventilation.\u00a0 Laboratory analysis of return air samples shows a methane liberation rate of 9.3 million cubic feet per day through the main mine fans.\u00a0 The development units are ventilated using a split system with exhausting line curtains or auxiliary fans and ventilation tubing.\u00a0\nThe mine employs a total of 402 underground and 65 surface miners working three shifts per day, two production shifts and a maintenance shift, five days per week.\u00a0 The evening shift is designated as a maintenance shift.\u00a0 The mine produces an average of 17,600 tons of raw material daily from six continuous mining machine units and one longwall unit.\u00a0 Six continuous mining machine Mechanized Mining Units (MMUs) comprise three super sections where two units operate side-by-side and dump coal at the same section loading point.\u00a0 Coal is transported from the faces by battery-powered ram cars, freedom cars (battery-powered shuttle cars), and a longwall face conveyor.\u00a0 The coal is then transported to the production shaft bottom by belt conveyors, stored in underground bunkers, and hoisted to the surface by skip hoist cars.\u00a0 Employees and materials are transported in and out of the mine via man hoists and underground travel is facilitated by a diesel-powered track haulage system.\u00a0\nThe super sections support longwall mining.\u00a0 Longwall panels are developed 750 feet wide by 11,500 feet long.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, mining was ongoing on the 3 super sections and the longwall.\n\u00a0\nPrior to the accident, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular health and safety inspection of the mine on June 26, 2014.\u00a0 A regular safety and health inspection started on July 1, 2014, and was ongoing at the time of the accident.\u00a0 The Non-Fatal Days Lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for the mine in 2013 was 0.56 compared to a National NFDL rate of 3.28 for mines of this type.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On August 20, 2014, the mine was conducting normal mining operations.\u00a0 Coal production started on the 24 Right super section (013 and 014 MMUs) on the midnight shift and continued into the day shift.\u00a0 The 24 Right day shift crew arrived on the section at approximately 8:20 a.m.\u00a0 Rick Koger, Section Electrician, started his daily routine of placing calibration gas on the methane monitor for the right side continuous mining machine.\u00a0 Koger then went to the right side roof bolting machine located in the No. 3 entry inby survey station No. 31596 to test the methane sensors on the roof bolting machine.\u00a0 The roof bolting machines at this mine are equipped with a methane monitor that has dual sensors; one sensor is located underneath each operator\u2019s drill canopy.\u00a0 According to Koger, both the right side continuous mining machine and the right side roof bolting machine functioned properly when calibration gas was applied to the methane monitor sensors.\u00a0 After he completed the checks on the roof bolting machine, Koger started to walk away.\u00a0 One of the roof bolting machine operators called for him to come back. \u00a0Koger was told that the roof bolting machine would not start.\u00a0 Koger started troubleshooting the roof bolting machine.\u00a0 Koger stated that he took the cover off the largest explosion proof enclosure (see Appendix A) on the roof bolting machine in order to troubleshoot the electrical circuits.\u00a0 Koger found a blown fuse and a broken resistor wire.\u00a0 He determined that the blown fuse and broken resistor wire did not correct the startup problem.\u00a0 At no time did Koger or anyone else deenergize the power for this roof bolting machine at the power center.Some outby maintenance supervisors are also assigned to oversee a mining section as part of their normal duties.\u00a0 Those maintenance supervisors travel to the sections on a regular basis to assist the section electricians.\u00a0 Justice, a Maintenance Supervisor, was assigned to the 24 Right section (see Appendix B).\u00a0 On the day of the accident, Justice traveled to the section as part of his normal duties.\u00a0 Justice entered the mine at approximately 7:52 a.m.\u00a0 He walked to the maintenance area and traveled by diesel powered man bus (track) to the 24 Right section.\u00a0 Justice arrived on the section at approximately 9:20 a.m.\u00a0 When Justice arrived on the section, he learned that the roof bolting machine was not operating.\u00a0 Justice traveled the No. 3 entry to the right side roof bolting machine to assist Koger with troubleshooting and electrical work on the roof bolting machine.\u00a0 Koger told Justice what he had done and they both discussed the next steps to be taken.\u00a0 Justice then directed Koger to get an IS relay from the parts sled for the emergency stop circuit.At this time, Justice performed electrical work, instead of troubleshooting, when the IS relay was removed and a new relay was installed.\u00a0 After replacing the IS relay, it was determined that the relay was not the problem.\u00a0 Justice instructed Koger to go to the methane monitor power supply and open the electrical enclosure for further troubleshooting.\u00a0 The methane monitor power supply electrical enclosure was located in the center toward the front of the walk-through roof bolting machine.\u00a0 At some point, Justice placed the circuit breaker, which was inside the largest explosion proof enclosure of the roof bolting machine, in the \u201coff\u201d position and replaced the IS relay with the original relay he had taken out earlier (see Appendix C).It is believed that Justice was trying to put the relay retainer bands in place when he came into contact with the loose strands of the red phase lead or the connection lug on the line side of the breaker.\u00a0 This contact put 346 VAC from the tip of his left hand ring finger through his body to ground.\u00a0 The 346 VAC is the phase-to-ground voltage of a 600 VAC three-phase circuit.Koger walked to the methane monitor power supply and was preparing to remove the cover of the electrical enclosure.\u00a0 He heard Justice make a noise.\u00a0 Koger stated he turned and ran out of the walkway to the back of the roof bolting machine and observed that Justice appeared to be in contact with an energized electrical circuit.\u00a0 According to Koger, Justice was on his knees and appeared to have both hands inside the panel board of the roof bolting machine.\u00a0 Koger ran to Justice and kicked him, to knock him away from the energized circuit of the roof bolting machine.\u00a0 Koger stated that when kicked, Justice was not knocked away from the machine, but Koger believed that Justice had been freed from the energized circuit.\u00a0 Koger then grabbed Justice by the shoulders and pulled him to the ground.\u00a0 Koger stated that he did not feel an electrical shock when he grabbed Justice.Greg Burress, Roof Bolting Machine Operator, was also near the roof bolting machine when the accident happened. \u00a0Burress yelled for help.\u00a0 Terry Hamilton, Section Foreman, and Luke Stull, Geologist, were located just outby the roof bolting machine in the intersection and heard Burress.\u00a0 Hamilton came to the accident scene and started first aid.\u00a0 Tim LaForce, Continuous Miner Coordinator, was notified of the accident by Stull, and they arrived at the scene shortly after Hamilton.\u00a0 Burress left to get first aid supplies.\u00a0 Todd Keen, Roof Bolting Machine Operator, went to the mine phone to request an ambulance. \u00a0On his way back to the accident scene, Keen met Roby Thomas, Left Side Continuous Mining Machine Operator, with the Automatic External Defibrillator (AED).\u00a0 Keen took the AED to the accident scene. \u00a0While first aid was being rendered, the AED was placed on Justice.\u00a0 The AED recommended one shock, which was given.\u00a0 The AED did not recommend any further shocks.\u00a0 Jackie Horn, Right Side Continuous Mining Machine Operator, Burress, LaForce, and Keen continued administering first aid.\u00a0 Daniel Smith, Roof Bolting Machine Operator, went to obtain track clearance and prepare a man bus to transport the victim to the surface.\u00a0 LaForce instructed Hamilton to go to the mine phone at the power center, notify management,\u00a0 \u00a0and make sure the track was clear from the 24 Right section to the Horn Mountain shaft bottom. \u00a0Hamilton met Anthony Cook, Scoop Operator, and directed him to make sure the roadway between the No. 3 entry and the supply hole was clear and to take the scoop to the No. 3 entry where the victim was located. \u00a0Justice was secured on a backboard, loaded into the bucket of the scoop, and transported to the man bus. \u00a0Justice was then transported on the man bus to the Horn Mountain shaft bottom.\u00a0 LaForce, Keen, Burress, and Horn continued performing CPR on the victim during transport while Smith operated the man bus.\u00a0Mercy Ambulance Service was notified of the accident at approximately 10:29 a.m.\u00a0 The ambulance arrived at the mine site at approximately 10:55 a.m.\u00a0 At approximately 11:20 a.m., the man trip arrived on the shaft bottom with Justice and the EMTs from the ambulance service took over resuscitation efforts.\u00a0 They continued CPR and transferred Justice to the top of the shaft and into the ambulance.\u00a0 They left the mine at approximately 11:53 a.m. and transported Justice to Clinch Valley Medical Center, Richlands, Virginia, arriving at approximately 12:16 p.m.\u00a0 The emergency room physician, Dr. Ben Kerny, pronounced Michael Justice dead at 12:29 p.m.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On August 20, 2014, at 11:03 a.m., Quintin Justice, Mine Engineer, called the MSHA toll free number to inform MSHA of the accident.\u00a0 A citation was issued because MSHA was not notified immediately, at once, without delay, and within 15 minutes.Personnel from the MSHA Hotline contacted Scott Beverly, Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, at 11:10 a.m.\u00a0 A copy of the MSHA Escalation Report was sent to Beverly.\u00a0 Information concerning the accident was gathered and an accident investigation team was assembled.\u00a0 The team consisted of Dennis Shortt, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector (Electrical Specialist); Mark Deel, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector (Health Specialist); and Jason Hess, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector (Ventilation Specialist).\u00a0 Shortt was designated the lead accident investigator.\u00a0Cornelius Simmons, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector and Shortt were underground at the Buchanan Mine when the accident occurred. \u00a0Shortt was located at 23 Right longwall belt drive area and Simmons was on the 25 Right section. \u00a0Simmons traveled to the 24 Right section and assisted with the investigation.\u00a0\nJames Kiser, Assistant District Manager; Delmer Hess, Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector; Michael Colley, Supervisory Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector, along with Simmons, were located on the 25 Right section at the time of the accident. \u00a0D. Hess was informed by Ray Kinder, Mine Foreman that a miner was found unresponsive on 24 Right section.\u00a0 D. Hess directed Danny Atwell, Mine Superintendent, to locate Shortt and have Shortt meet D. Hess at the mouth of 24 Right.\u00a0 Atwell called Eric Vandyke, Maintenance Supervisor, who was traveling with Shortt, and informed Shortt that there had been an accident and requested Shortt meet D. Hess at the mouth of 24 Right section.\u00a0 At 11:00 a.m., Shortt issued a 103(k) order verbally to Ray Kinder, Mine Foreman.\u00a0 The order was issued to ensure the health and safety of persons in the affected areas of the mine until the accident investigation could be completed.\u00a0 J. Hess arrived at the mine and traveled underground to the accident scene with personnel from the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy (DMME).Officials from CONSOL Buchanan Mining Company LLC, DMME, and MSHA participated in the accident investigation at the mine (see Appendix D).\u00a0 On August 20 and 25, 2014, the investigation team collected information, examined the accident scene, and took photographs of the affected area.\u00a0 The accident investigation team obtained the circuit breaker associated with the fatal accident to examine and test it under laboratory conditions. \u00a0\u00a0Fred Martin, Educational Field Services (EFS) examined the victim\u2019s training records.MSHA and DMME conducted joint interviews with 15 miners on August 21 and 22, 2014, at the CONSOL office located at Oakwood, Virginia.\u00a0 Those persons interviewed are listed in Appendix D.", "DISCUSSION": "Physical FactorsThe accident occurred in the No. 3 heading approximately 127 feet inby survey station No. 31596 on the 24 Right section off 3 East Mains, 014-0 MMU.\u00a0 The section consisted of 4 entries.\u00a0 Entries No. 2 and 3 provide intake air to ventilate the section.\u00a0 Entries No. 1 and No. 4 are used for air returning from the section.The section, including the area around the accident site was dry to damp.\u00a0 The accident site was relatively flat and level with a roof height of approximately 7.8 feet.\u00a0 The roof and ribs in this area were generally smooth.The victim\u2019s work gloves were located on top of the area light at the operator\u2019s deck of the roof bolting machine.\u00a0 The Fluke multimeter located at the accident scene belonged to Koger.\u00a0 The multimeter was set on \u201cOhms\u201d to measure resistance, and was not being used at the time of the accident. \u00a0A Fluke non-contact voltage tester was also located at the scene.During the investigation, it was determined that the roof bolting machine\u2019s onboard circuit breaker had wiring deficiencies.\u00a0 The connection of the red phase lead (closest to the IS relay) to the line side of the circuit breaker had several strands of copper wire protruding out of the connection lug and one strand of the wire protruding toward the IS control relay on which the victim was working.\u00a0 The IS relay was located approximately 1\u00bd inches from the copper strand.\u00a0 Also, the white phase lead (farthest from the IS relay) was not properly installed in the connection lug.\u00a0 There were strands of wire protruding around the connection lug and the lead was loose in the lug which caused heating and damage to the insulation (See photographs in the Appendices).It is believed that Justice was trying to put the relay retainer bands in place when he contacted the energized circuit because this was the next step in the process of installing the IS relay. \u00a0These bands were very close to the energized circuit, and this was what the victim was working on according to Koger and evidence at the scene of the accident.When the new circuit breaker was installed, approximately 7 to 10 inches of the white phase lead had to be removed in order to access the portion of the lead that was not damaged by heating.\u00a0 The protruding wire strands of the red phase lead were one possible contact point. \u00a0The autopsy indicated two thermal injuries to the tip of the ring finger of Justice\u2019s left hand \u2013 a 2 centimeter blister and one 0.9 centimeter blister.\u00a0The investigation further determined that the original cause of the electrical problem was a defective panic strip located at the left side of the roof bolting machine operator\u2019s position.\u00a0 MSHA electrical specialist, Lincous Gary Perkins, oversaw the post-accident troubleshooting and repair.Troubleshooting and Electrical Work\u00a0\nTroubleshooting or testing is the process of locating electrical problems and verifying that proper repairs have been made.\u00a0 In contrast, electrical work is installing, repairing, or replacing electrical equipment, components, or conductors.\u00a0 Electrical work requires the electrician to first perform lock out and tag out procedures.Justice began troubleshooting and reportedly thought that the IS relay was defective.\u00a0 According to interviews, the victim removed the original IS relay and installed a replacement IS relay.\u00a0 He then removed the replacement IS relay and installed the original IS relay.\u00a0 It is believed that when the accident occurred, the victim had just re-installed the original IS relay and was attempting to place the relay retainer bands over the IS relay and continue with the troubleshooting process.\u00a0Before the victim secured the IS relay in place, by placing the relay retainer bands over the IS relay, he should have traveled to the section power center (located approximately 563 feet outby the roof bolting machine in the No. 3 entry), de-energized the circuit breaker, removed the cable coupler or plug from the receptacle on the power center to establish visually that the circuit was de-energized and disconnected, and locked out and tagged out the visual disconnect (cable coupler).\u00a0 When the victim broke the plane of the explosion proof enclosure for the purpose of securing the IS relay, he was no longer troubleshooting but was doing electrical work.Each time the victim broke the plane of the explosion proof enclosure to replace the IS relay, he should have first de-energized the circuit breaker, removed the cable coupler, and locked out and tagged out the cable coupler at the section power center prior to doing this electrical work.\u00a0 He should have repeated this process each time he removed and replaced the IS relay.EquipmentThe roof bolting machine involved in the accident was manufactured by J.H. Fletcher & Co., type DDR-15-A, serial number 2009101, with MSHA Approval No. 2G-2956A-6.\u00a0 The nominal input voltage to the roof bolting machine is 600 volts, 3-phase, and 60 hertz. \u00a0A No. 2 American Wire Gage (AWG) trailing cable was used to supply power to the walk thru roof bolting machine.\u00a0 During operation, the roof bolting machine utilizes a cable reel to spool cable on and off the roof bolting machine. \u00a0The roof bolting machine is equipped with metal track-type crawlers to move.\u00a0 The explosion proof box cover, which covers the electrical components in the box, is 16 \u00bd inches tall and located on the right side (off side) with the bottom approximately 22 inches above the mine floor.\u00a0 The original equipment manufacturer provides a 250 amp circuit breaker with a trip range of 500 to 1,000 amps.\u00a0 The circuit breaker that was in the roof bolting machine at the time of the accident was a 250 amp circuit breaker with a trip range of 875 to 1,750 amps.\u00a0 The IS relay being worked on by the victim was located approximately 36 inches above the mine floor.\u00a0Testing\nExamination of the onboard circuit breaker was conducted on September 16 and September 17, 2014, at the MSHA Approval and Certification Center (A&CC) in Triadelphia, West Virginia.\u00a0 The examination of the circuit breaker did verify eight deficiencies; however, none of the deficiencies found indicated that the circuit breaker contributed to the accident.\u00a0 The examination verified that there were several conductor strands of #26 AWG that were not captured in the terminal lug closest to the IS control relay on which the victim was working.\u00a0Mine Examinations\nThe pre-shift and on-shift records for the 24 Right section (013 and 014 MMUs) were found to be up-to-date.\u00a0 No significant entries were recorded for the midnight shift pre-shift examination on the day of the accident related to the accident scene.The last weekly electrical examination record for the right roof bolting machine was up-to-date.\u00a0 The \u201cExamination of Electrical Equipment\u201d record book showed the right roof bolting machine was last examined on August 19, 2014.\u00a0 The record book lists a Hazardous Condition of \u201cPlace in cable needed additional tape.\u201d The Action Taken for correction showed \u201cTaped.\u201d\u00a0Experience and TrainingMichael Justice was hired on July 26, 2010 and received experienced miner training at Buchanan Mine #1 on August 2, 2010. \u00a0He had nineteen years, three weeks, and four days of mining experience.\u00a0 He had four years, two weeks and four days with CONSOL Buchanan Mining Company, LLC, and two years, fifteen weeks as a Maintenance Supervisor at the mine. \u00a0Justice\u2019s training was current and he was properly certified by the DMME and qualified by MSHA to perform duties as an underground electrician. \u00a0He completed Underground Electrical Repairmen retraining on September 30, 2013. \u00a0In addition to the required training, CONSOL Buchanan Mining Company, LLC had a program in place at the time of the accident to evaluate electricians on their skill and knowledge of regulations, including \u201cLock and Tag Out.\u201d\u00a0 The victim had a Certificate of Task Training and Observation Form completed for a \u201cFull Cycle Observation \u201con June 2, 2014, for \u201cLock and Tag Out.\u201d\u00a0 Company records show at least 21 different Certificates of Task Training and Observation Forms had been completed for him since he was hired for \u201cLock and Tag Out.\u201d\u00a0In 2014, Justice trained three electricians in proper lock and tag out procedures, and observed the lock and tag out practices of these electricians.\u00a0 Koger was one of these electricians. \u00a0Training and Observation forms were completed for these sessions.Before the fatal accident, the company did not have a written policy clearly defining the difference between performing electrical troubleshooting and performing electrical work.\u00a0 The company has since modified its training program to clearly define the difference between electrical troubleshooting and electrical work.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "An analysis was conducted to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 During the analysis a root cause was identified that, if eliminated, would have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.Listed below is the root cause identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective action implemented to prevent a recurrence of the accident:Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator failed to follow well established and well known safe electrical work requirements. Additionally, the mine operator\u2019s programs, policies and procedures were not sufficient to prevent miners from working on energized electrical equipment without first locking and tagging out the equipment before electrical work is started.Corrective Action:\u00a0 The mine operator modified its training program to clearly define the difference between performing electrical troubleshooting and performing electrical work.\u00a0 All miners were retrained on the differences between performing troubleshooting and electrical work.\u00a0 Troubleshooting training included glove requirements at specific voltages.\u00a0 Electrical work training included lock out, tag out procedures. \u00a0The mine\u2019s Part 48 training program was revised to include specific training of the items above in the Task Training section.In addition, a managerial oversight program was implemented by the mine operator to ensure that the mine operator\u2019s policies, procedures and programs are followed by the miners.", "CONCLUSION": "The victim did not de-energize, lock out, and tag out the visual disconnecting device on an electrical circuit prior to performing electrical work on that circuit.\u00a0 The non-workmanlike and deficient installation of the conductors on the circuit breaker may have been an indirect cause of the accident.\u00a0 The victim was performing electrical work inside the energized explosion proof enclosure when he came in contact with either the line side connection lug for the red phase lead to the circuit breaker or with strand(s) of No. 2 AWG wires protruding from that connection lug.\u00a0 The company\u2019s programs, policies, and procedures that were in place at the time of the accident failed to prevent this accident.\u00a0Approved:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0______________________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ______________________________\nClayton Sparks\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Date\nDistrict Manager\u00a0", "ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS": "The Section 103(k) order was modified 6 times during the investigation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 103(k) Order No. 8204341 issued August 20, 2014, to Consol Buchanan Mining Company, LLC, Buchanan #1 Mine: A Fatal accident occurred at this operation on August 20, 2014 at approximately 1045 a.m.\u00a0 This order is being issued, under Section 103(k) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, to prevent the destruction of any evidence which would assist in investigating the cause or causes of the accident.\u00a0 It prohibits all activity inby the 24 Right Section Power Center until MSHA has determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations in this area.\nA 104(d)(1) Citation, No. 8204342, was issued for a violation of 30 CFR \u00a7 75.511.\u00a0 A fatal accident occurred at this mine on August 20, 2014.\u00a0 A Maintenance Supervisor, who was a qualified electrician, was electrocuted while working inside an energized 600 VAC roof bolting machine explosion proof enclosure.\u00a0 The Fletcher walk thru roof bolting machine, Model No. DDR-15-A, S/N 2009101 was located on the 24 Right section.\u00a0 The Maintenance Supervisor was in the process of replacing the intrinsically safe (IS) relay and retaining bands when he came in contact with at least one phase of the energized three phase circuit.\n\u00a0The operator failed to ensure that the equipment was de-energized, that the cable coupler was removed, and that the circuit was locked out and tagged out prior to installing, repairing or replacing electrical equipment, components, or conductors.\u00a0 The mine operator engaged in aggravated conduct when the maintenance supervisor worked on the energized circuit without de-energizing, removing the cable coupler, and locking and tagging out the cable coupler.\u00a0 This violation is an unwarrantable failure to comply with a mandatory standard.\n\n"}}, "/data-reports/fatality-reports/2014/fatality-17-august-2-2014": {"report-url": "https://www.msha.gov/data-reports/fatality-reports/2014/fatality-17-august-2-2014", "accidnet-classification": "Falling, Rolling, or Sliding Rock or Material of Any Kind", "location": "Belzer Pit, Montana", "mine-type": "Metal and Non-Metal", "mine-controller": "Steve  Fossum;

Martin had not received task training in the health and safety aspects of the task he was assigned, specifically working near energized conductors.", "GENERAL INFORMATION": "Murray Mines Inc., a common sand and gravel operation owned and operated by Murray Mines Inc. is located in Ridgeville, Colleton County, South Carolina. \u00a0The principal operating official is James Murray Jr., President. \u00a0The mine normally operates two 12 hour shifts per day, five days per week. \u00a0Total employment is 10 persons.At the time of the accident, sand was mined using a dredging method in a water filled pit (pond). \u00a0Overburden and vegetation were stripped from the edge of the bank. \u00a0A cutter head on the dredge removed the sand, and it was then pumped to the processing plant where it was washed and screened to size for use in the construction industry and at golf courses.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) completed the last regular inspection at this operation on November 21, 2013.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On the day of the accident, July 21, 2014, Kyle Martin (victim) arrived at the mine at approximately 8:00 a.m., his normal starting time.\u00a0 His first task was to insert approximately 150 feet of pipe in the existing dredge pump line. \u00a0Afterwards, he performed general maintenance work at the plant. \u00a0At 12:00 p.m., Martin left the mine to pick up lunch for the mine employees.After lunch, a belt conveyor malfunctioned in the plant, blocking the screw auger with sand. \u00a0The dredge stopped pumping sand.\u00a0 Martin worked on the plant to resolve the problem.\u00a0 At approximately 2:55 p.m., Larry Freeman, Plant Manager, spoke with Martin at the plant.\u00a0Shortly thereafter, Martin left the plant and went to the dredge to check the conductors for the upcoming night shift. \u00a0This is a normal daily activity to ensure that there is a sufficient amount of slack in the 480 volt power conductors to allow the dredge to advance.\u00a0 Mike Datre, Dredge Operator, pushed a boat to the shore from the dredge, where it was tied, for Martin to use. \u00a0Martin got in the boat and paddled it approximately 300 feet to the area where the power conductors for the dredge exited the water and were laying on the ground.\u00a0 \u00a0At approximately 3:30 p.m., Datre tried to call Martin to replace him on the dredge, because Datre needed to leave at 4:00 p.m.\u00a0 Datre was unable to contact Martin so he called Ryan Soard, Loader Operator, using his two-way radio.\u00a0 Datre told Soard he needed someone to replace him on the dredge and also told Soard he saw the boat but did not see Martin.At approximately 3:45 p.m., Ian Graham, Laborer, drove to the dredge to replace Datre and parked near Martin\u2019s truck.\u00a0 Datre told Graham that Martin had taken the boat. \u00a0Graham saw the boat and walked toward it.\u00a0 As Graham approached the boat, he saw Martin lying on his back, partly submerged in the water in front of the boat, which was on top of the conductors. \u00a0When Graham stepped in the water, he immediately felt a light shock on his left leg and realized something was wrong. \u00a0Graham then called Freeman telling him to call 911 and to shut off the power.Graham called out to Datre who was still on the dredge across the pond. \u00a0At 3:58 p.m., Datre saw Graham jumping and waving his arms. \u00a0Datre pulled off his back pack, left it on the dredge, jumped into the water from the left side of the dredge, and swam to shore.\u00a0 He then ran to the area where the accident occurred.Graham saw Freeman leave the motor control center box where the dredge was energized.\u00a0 He tested the water with his foot and did not feel any shock. \u00a0Graham then pulled Martin out of the water and started cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\u00a0James Rogers, Safety Director, was operating a dozer clearing an area near the front of the dredge when he received a call from Freeman reporting the accident.\u00a0 Rogers took the dozer to the accident scene and assisted performing CPR.\u00a0 \u00a0At 4:17 p.m., Emergency Medical Personnel from the Colleton County Fire-Rescue arrived.\u00a0 The victim was transported by ambulance to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead at 5:25 p.m.\u00a0 The cause of death was attributed to electrocution.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "MSHA was notified of the accident at 4:11 p.m. on July 21, 2014, by a telephone call from Barbra Mascarelli to the National Call Center. \u00a0The National Call Center notified Patrick Sharp, District Health Specialist, and an investigation was started the same day.\u00a0 An order was issued pursuant to Section 103(j) of the Mine Act. \u00a0This order was later modified to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act after the arrival of an Authorized Representative at the mine site. \u00a0MSHA\u2019s accident investigation team traveled to the mine, conducted a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident. \u00a0MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees.", "DISCUSSION": "Description of the Pond Area and DredgeThe accident occurred in the pond area of the mine approximately 300 feet behind the 400 HP dredge. \u00a0This mine had two motor control centers (MCC), commonly referred to as the Booster Pump Shed and the #2 Shed.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, the 480 volt power for the dredge was supplied from the #2 Shed through approximately 1,500 feet of power conductors that had been laid across the ground and into the water.\u00a0 The conductors were tied to floats, spaced 10 feet apart, to keep the conductors near the surface of the water. \u00a0The conductors came into a main disconnect on the dredge.\u00a0 The main disconnect was used for starting the main motor across the line. \u00a0A soft start for the main motor was on board but it was not used.The dredge had a 30 HP Baldor fresh water pump, a 25 HP North American Electric hydraulic pump, and a 110V control transformer.\u00a0 The full load current rating of fresh water pump was 36 amps. The pump was protected by 100 amp dual element time delay fuses encased in a fused disconnect.\u00a0 The hydraulic pump had a full load current rating of 28.5 amps and was protected by 60 amp dual element time delay fuses encased in a fused disconnect.The victim was found near the shore in a shallow end of the pond that was approximately 9-11 inches deep.\u00a0 This is the area where the dredge operators accessed the boat to travel back and forth to the dredge. \u00a0The dredge operators paddled the boat approximately 300 feet to the dredge using a single paddle.WeatherThe weather on the day of the accident was cloudy with rain in the area and a temperature of approximately 80 degrees Fahrenheit with a light wind.\u00a0 Weather was not considered a contributing factor to the accident.Physical FactorsThe conductors supplied 3 phase 480/277V exclusively to a suction type dredge powered from a 3 phase 500KVA pad mounted transformer with a wye-wye configuration. \u00a0The transformer primary is 12470/7200V with a secondary of 480/277V and an impedance of 2.2%.\u00a0 The transformer fed a motor control room which exclusively feeds the dredge.\u00a0Inside the motor control room, a fused disconnect was used to connect/disconnect power to the dredge. \u00a0The power could not be disconnected to the line side of the fused disconnect because it was hardwired to the secondary of the 500KVA transformer which only could be accessed by the power company. \u00a0Based on persons interviewed, investigators determined that the fuses were changed on several occasions while the line side of the fused disconnect was energized.\u00a0 A non-contributory citation was issued.The load side of the fused disconnect was connected to a jacketed cable of three aluminum conductors. \u00a0The jacket was worn and scuffed to the point where the manufacturer\u2019s information was no longer legible.\u00a0 Management could not provide any information regarding the cable. \u00a0The jacketed cable exited the motor control room and was spliced into individual conductors that powered the dredge. There was approximately 1,000 feet of the conductor per phase with an electrical rating for operation of 600V or less in wet or dry locations, including direct burial in the earth, and a maximum allowable ampacity of 500 amps at 90\u00b0C.The boat became energized to the same potential of the conductor; 480V line to line. The victim was exposed to 277V line to ground while standing in shallow water.BoatThe flat bottom, aluminum boat involved in the accident was 12 feet long and 46.5 inch wide.\u00a0 This boat was the only access boat to the dredge that was provided at the mine.During the inspection of the boat, investigators noted three ribs located on the bottom of the boat that had been repaired. \u00a0The right (starboard) side rib was observed with two strips of metal, one on each side of the rib, that had been placed over a strip of rubber and secured by screws into the bottom of the boat. \u00a0A section of the metal strips, toward the rear of the boat, was observed separated with a thin piece of rubber lodged between the metal strip and the boat bottom. \u00a0Martin was not wearing a life jacket. \u00a0A newly purchased life jacket was found in his truck parked in the vicinity of the dredge.", "TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE": "Kyle Martin had 11 years and 8 weeks of mining experience, all at this mine. \u00a0\u00a0The investigators reviewed the mine operator's training records and found that Martin received annual refresher training on March 29, 2014. \u00a0Martin had received task training for front-end loader operator, excavator operator, dredge operator, bulldozer operator, and mine maintenance.\u00a0 However, Martin had not received task training in the health and safety aspects of the task he was assigned.\u00a0 He was not provided training for the hazards associated with working near energized conductors.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "A root cause analysis was conducted and the following root causes were identified:Root Cause:\u00a0Management failed to ensure that the individual power conductors supplying power to the dredge were provided with an outer jacket to protect them from mechanical damage thereby exposing miners to an electrical hazard.Corrective Action:\u00a0Management discontinued using the dredge as a mining method. An open pit excavation system will now be used to mine the material. The dredge and the associated electrical conductors have been removed from service.Root Cause:\u00a0Management failed to task train any miners, including the victim, to perform electrical tasks.Corrective Action:\u00a0Management established safe operating procedures by hiring an electrical contractor trained and experienced in electrical work. All miners are trained on the new safe operating procedures.", "CONCLUSION": "The accident occurred due to management\u2019s failure to ensure that the individual power conductors supplying power to the dredge were provided with an outer jacket to protect them from mechanical damage exposing miners to an electrical hazard.\u00a0 None of the persons at the mine were trained to perform electrical tasks.

It is located near Decker, Montana. The mine extracts coal from the Anderson-Dietz seam utilizing two draglines and two electric shovels for overburden removal. The coal is loaded by a shovel, front end loaders, and a hydraulic excavator into 240 ton haul trucks. The seam averages 80 feet in thickness and the overburden varies from 65 to 185 feet thick.At the time of the accident, the mine produced 50,000 tons of coal per day and employed 282 miners.

The mine\u2019s non-fatal days lost (NFDL) incidence rate in calendar year 2013 was 0.00, compared to the national average of 0.96 for mines of the same type in 2013.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "Monday, June 23, 2014, was the first day shift worked following a seven day break due to shift rotation. The truck drivers arrived at their equipment at approximately 6:55 a.m. At 7:00 a.m., Stewart Orcutt, was given his job assignment by Eli Whiteman, Crew C Supervisor. Orcutt was assigned to operate the Komatsu 830E truck, company number 361, to load coal from shovel number 303 in pit 4, cut 20.The shift proceeded as normal, with coal being loaded during the shift. A lunch break occurred at approximately 1:00 p.m. Near the end of the shift, loading was stopped temporarily while the shovel was being repositioned. As the shovel was repositioning, Orcutt was the first truck in line when the loading resumed at 6:33 p.m. Shovel Operator, Cy Olson called on the mine\u2019s FM radio (company radio) \u201ctruck 361 go dump out, you are done for the day.\u201d Leaving the loading area, Orcutt started shouting on the company radio, which was not understandable due to the loud music playing on a citizens band (CB) radio in the truck. Orcutt would often shout religious praises and key his microphone open to the CB radio speaker for long durations.According to heavy equipment operator Ed Shannon, who was operating the dump bulldozer, Orcutt did not dump his last load on the dump. It was later determined that the load was dumped at an elevation below. Orcutt then traveled to the Ramp 74 parking area where the shift change occurs. Orcutt parked, shut his truck off, but remained in the cab of the truck. Orcutt would normally wait in the truck until the crew bus arrived, then Orcutt would exit the truck. Four other drivers came to the parking area after dumping their last load. They exited their trucks and gathered on the ground, waiting for the crew bus. Shannon drove a crew cab truck and stopped at the parking area to pick up the four drivers on the ground. Shannon noticed Orcutt in his truck and waved at him. Orcutt acknowledged and waved back. A crew bus arrived, drove by the parking area and proceeded to the #303 shovel. At this time, Orcutt restarted his truck and drove toward the #303 shovel. The crew bus passed Orcutt on its way back to the parking area. Orcutt turned around and followed the crew bus, but did not turn into the parking area. Instead, Orcutt turned onto Ramp 65, which is the road to the office/shop complex. Brandon Wilcox, the night shift truck driver for truck #361, observed Orcutt operating truck 361 and thought maybe the shop had sent Orcutt a message to come to the truck repair shop. Wilcox started walking to the lunch shack to call his boss on the company radio and to get a ride to another truck. Wilcox saw Orcutt turn onto the Ramp 65 Ranch dump at what appeared to be full speed. The truck traveled across the dump area, over the six-foot high berm, and disappeared.Wilcox ran to the lunch shack and called on the company radio \u201ctruck 361, are you ok?\u201d Wilcox received no answer. Wilcox told Chris Boll, Truck Driver, what he had seen, but there were no other witnesses. Boll said he would drive up to the Ranch dump and look. Wilcox called on the company radio for the Shift Supervisor, Rob Marney, and asked him to go to the Ranch dump and look for Orcutt\u2019s truck. Marney and equipment operator Randy Barney arrived at the lunch shack. They picked up Wilcox, drove to the Ranch dump, and saw a hole in the berm through which Orcutt\u2019s truck had traveled. Boll, an emergency medical technician (EMT) and mine rescue member, parked his truck on the Ranch dump. Boll called a \u2018Mayday\u2019 over the company radio and went into the spoil \u201cV,\u201d where Orcutt\u2019s truck had stopped the opposite embankment at the bottom of the spoil \u201cV.\u201d Wilcox and Barney were already at the scene. Orcutt was visible in the truck, but did not respond when his name was called. Wilcox held the truck door open while Boll entered and checked for a pulse. No pulse was detected. Leonard Hotchken, EMT, arrived and also checked for a pulse. It was decided to remove the victim from the truck cab onto the deck. When more help arrived, the victim was removed from the truck to a level place on the ground. The EMTs started cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and an automated emergency defibrillator (AED) was used. The AED advised \u2018no shock\u2019 and the EMTs continued CPR. The Rocky Mountain Ambulance Service from Sheridan, Wyoming arrived on scene and applied a cardiac monitor which indicated no heart activity. Terry Bullis, Big Horn County Coroner, pronounced the death at 10:35 p.m. on June 23, 2014. Orcutt was removed from the accident scene by Bullis and transported to St. Vincent\u2019s hospital in Billings, Montana for an autopsy.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "Whiteman notified the MSHA Call Center of the accident on Monday, June 23, 2014, at 7:49 p.m. The call center notified William Reitze of District 9 at 7:58 p.m. Reitze verbally issued a 103 (j) order at 8:07 p.m. to Whiteman to secure the accident scene and assure miners\u2019 safety at the mine. Reitze then notified Todd Jaqua, Field Office Supervisor in Gillette, Wyoming, and instructed Jaqua to dispatch an inspector to the accident scene. Jaqua dispatched Coal Mine Inspector David Maynard, who was in Sheridan, Wyoming. Maynard modified the 103(j) order to a 103(k) order upon arrival at the mine. Maynard conducted a preliminary examination of the accident scene that evening. Photographs and measurements were taken of the haul truck\u2019s route of travel and location after the accident.Jaqua; David Hamilton, Coal Mine Inspector; and Maynard arrived on June 24, 2014, and began the formal investigation of existing physical conditions, conducted initial interviews with mine employees present at the scene, and made the initial examination of the truck. Digital photographs and relevant measurements of the scene were taken as part of the investigation. The investigation also included a review of training records, mine examination and equipment records, and maintenance records. Interviews were conducted on June 25, 26, and 27, 2014, with persons who had knowledge of the accident (see Appendix B).On June 26 and 27, 2014, data from electronic equipment removed from the truck was downloaded for investigation. This information was shared with MSHA Technical Support Mechanical Engineer, Ronald Medina. Review of the information did not reveal any issues related to the accident.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of Accident and Conditions:The scene of the accident was an overburden dumping location that had not been used for at least three weeks. The haul truck went through the dump berm, across a lower dump berm and came to rest approximately 75 feet below the dump. The Ranch 65 dump had a berm on the outer edge of the dump. The berm at the location of the accident extended 6 feet to the right side of a hole created by the truck going through the berm, and 5 feet and 5 inches to the left. The Komatsu 830E DC trucks on the mine site were measured to be 5 feet 4 inches high at mid-axle of the trucks and were in compliance with MSHA regulations.Approximately 0.35 inches of rain had fallen earlier in the day, ending at 7:00 a.m. The dump area was dry at the time of the accident. The temperature was 710 Fahrenheit, with a 3.5 to 4.6 miles-per-hour wind from the South. The road to the 65 Ranch dump was intermittently watered.The accident investigation team was not able to determine what caused the truck operated by Orcutt to travel across the dump, through the berm, and descend into the spoil \u201cV\u201d cut.General Machine InformationThe haul truck was a Komatsu 830E and the product identification number was A30818. The truck had direct current (DC) electric drive, and was a rigid frame rear dump truck that was designated by the company as unit number 361. The truck was equipped with a Cummins QSK 60, 16 cylinder, diesel engine and a General Electric (GE) Statex III, electric drive system. The electric drive system had a three-position control for the forward, reverse, and neutral positions. Two GE type 787 electric wheel motors, one at each rear wheel, powered by an engine driven alternator, propelled the truck. The foot operated service brake or the electric retarder were utilized to slow the truck as needed.Summary of Equipment Related Physical Factors:No braking or steering system defects were found.\nWhen the haul truck stopped suddenly at the bottom of the spoil \u201cV\u201d cut, an arc chute for the RP2 contactor dislodged and hit the door of the electrical enclosure. This caused the Statex III Drive System central processing unit (CPU) to record an RP2 contactor fault. The RP2 contactor is one of several contactors that are energized to establish the electric retarding circuit. No other braking, steering, retarder, or electric drive system faults were logged during the time of the accident.\nThe RP2 contactor fault triggered the Statex III Drive System CPU to store 51 frames of data, 40 before the fault code event and 10 after, plus the event itself. In terms of time this was 8.51 seconds prior to the event and 2.08 seconds afterward. This was the standard window of data that is saved as a result of such events and was a total of 10.59 seconds. The data within the 10.59 second time frame was analyzed.\nPutting the 10.59 seconds on a timeline, data collection began at time 0. Near the 1.8 second mark, the Statex data indicated the wheel speed suddenly increased, indicating the point where the truck crested the edge of the dump and started down the steep slope. Near the 6 second mark, the wheel speed data indicated the truck suddenly stopped, apparently when the truck struck the bottom of the \u201cV\u201d cut. The RP2 contactor fault occurred at 8.51 seconds. The Statex data indicated that the service brake and park brake were not applied at any time during the 10.59 second period of data collected. In addition, the Statex data indicated that the retarder was not applied as the truck approached the berm and traveled through it. After the truck went over the edge, the Statex data indicated intermittent retarder applications mostly at values of less than 10%, with 0% representing no retarder and 100% representing maximum retarder. These intermittent retarder commands occurred while the truck was bouncing down the slope and did not cause any effective slowing of the truck based on the wheel speed data collected.\nA map based on global positioning system (GPS) data points from the Modular Mining Systems Dispatch/Mine Care system was generated that displayed the truck\u2019s position after the shift ended. The GPS data showed that the empty truck went to the parking area when the shift ended. Next, the truck left the parking area and traveled on a haul road back toward the dump point that had been used during the shift. Thereafter, the truck made a U-turn, traveled to the 65 Ranch dump, went through the berm, and down the steep slope.\nExperience and training recordsOrcutt was an experienced truck driver, having 5 years and 50 weeks of experience, all at the Spring Creek Mine. Orcutt received task training on a Komatsu 830E haul truck on July 9, 2008. Orcutt received annual refresher training on January 16, 2014.The Cloud Peak Health and Safety Standards handbook, June 3, 2013 version, page 31, 7.1 states, \u201cThe driver and all passengers must wear their seat belts, where fitted, at all times.\u201d The seat belt in Orcutt\u2019s truck was not engaged when examined at the accident scene. The seat belt assembly was still intact after the accident and the seat belt functioned when tested.ToxicologyToxicology of the victim\u2019s blood was conducted post-mortem. The results were:Diphenhydramine: 0.19 MG/L quantitated in the blood and detected in the urine;\nCyclobenzaprine: 0.07 MG/L quantitated in the blood and detected in the urine;\nOxymorphone: 0.05 MG/L quantitated in the blood at this concentration;\nCaffeine: detected in the blood and urine;\nIbuprofen: detected in blood;\nAcetaminophen: detected in blood;\nGabapentin: detected in blood;\nMetoprolol: detected in blood.\nThe Toxicology results did not draw a conclusion with regard to the substances found in the victim\u2019s blood.Mine ExaminationsThe work area where the accident occurred was examined prior to the accident. No hazards were noted in the mine\u2019s examination records.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "An analysis was conducted to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were correctible through management controls. These root causes, if corrected could have prevented the accident or mitigated the outcome. The following root cause was identified:Root Cause:\u00a0The mine operator failed to ensure seat belts were used where there is a danger of overturning mobile equipment. The victim did not wear his seat belt.Corrective Action:\u00a0The mine operator modified its new miner and contractor training plans to emphasize the importance of the use of seat belts. The plan further emphasized the potential disciplinary actions for not wearing a seat belt.Additionally, the mine operator established a Safety Interaction Program that involves performing spot checks on a continual basis to determine if the miners are wearing their seat belts. This program also involves having conversations with employees about the use of seat belts and the requirement for wearing seat belts. The mine operator trained all miners and crews on the training plan revision and new safety interaction program, including the mandatory requirements of seat belt usage at the mine at all times.", "CONCLUSION": "The fatal accident occurred when the haul truck, operated by the victim, traveled through a berm, descended approximately 75 feet, and stopped abruptly against the opposite embankment in the bottom of a spoil \u201cV.\u201d The cause of the truck traveling through the berm was not determined. The victim was not wearing his seat belt when the accident occurred which resulted in him receiving fatal injuries.", "ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS": "103(j) Order No. 8477220 was issued to ensure the safety of all miners during and after any recovery actions taken for the affected area. It prohibited all activity at the Ramp 65 Ranch Dump and 500 feet to either side of its entrance, until MSHA determined that it is safe to resume normal mining operations. The order was modified to a section 103(k) order at 9:28 p.m. on June 23, 2014.\n104(a) Citation No. 8476775 was issued for a violation of 30 CFR \u00a7 77.403-1(g).

mechanic, age 67, was seriously injured on May 13, 2014. \u00a0Mr. Schmidt was performing maintenance on a cone crusher.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, Schmidt was standing on the crusher drive belt guard. \u00a0An excavator had been used to lower components into the cone crusher.\u00a0 The operator of the excavator stopped the work and was getting out of the cab to speak to Schmidt when the excavator swung and the bucket knocked Schmidt off of the crusher.\u00a0 Schmidt fell approximately 11 feet to the ground, landing on his head and shoulder.\u00a0 Schmidt was transported to the local hospital where he underwent emergency surgery to stabilize his condition.\u00a0 He spent more than a week in the Intensive Care Unit on life support.\u00a0 Following his hospitalization, Schmidt was sent to various long term care facilities, but succumbed to his injuries on May 26, 2015.Management failed to ensure that the hydraulic system on the excavator was deactivated. \u00a0This allowed the boom to swing, knocking the victim off of the cone crusher.\u00a0 Management also failed to ensure that miners were wearing fall protection devices when exposed to the danger of falling.On September 3, 2015, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) referred the accident to the Chargeability Review Committee (CRC).\u00a0 On April 12, 2016, the CRC determined that this death should be charged to the mining industry.\u00a0", "GENERAL INFORMATION": "Hualapai Pit is a surface construction sand and gravel operation, owned and operated by Desert Construction Inc., located near Kingman, Mohave County, Arizona.\u00a0 The principal operating official is Thomas Short, President.\u00a0 The mine employs five miners, and operates one eight-hour shift per day, five days per week.\u00a0Rock, sand, and gravel is mined from an open pit and transported to the plant by loader for crushing, sizing, and stockpiling.\u00a0 The final product is loaded into customer trucks by loader.\u00a0 The finished product is sold for use in the construction trades.Prior to the accident, MSHA completed the last regular inspection at this operation on March 11, 2014.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "Michael Schmidt, mechanic, arrived at the Hualapai Pit at 6:00 a.m. PST on Tuesday, May 13, 2014.\u00a0 Schmidt,\u00a0Mark Shaffer, laborer, and Donnie Scroggins, lead operator, set out to replace the bowls in the mine\u2019s cone crusher.\u00a0 The team was using a John Deere 790 ELC excavator to lift and move the heavy parts.\u00a0 Scroggins was operating the excavator, and Shaffer was helping Schmidt to replace the worn out parts in the cone crusher.\u00a0 The job proceeded without any reported problems until the accident, which took place at approximately 11:30 a.m.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nImmediately before the accident, Scroggins used the bucket of the excavator to lower the top bowl into the body of the crusher.\u00a0 Shaffer was below the crusher putting the oil plug into the bottom of the cone crusher and Schmidt was above making sure the bowl was placed properly.\u00a0 The bowl was in place and had been disconnected from the excavator bucket.\u00a0 Schmidt gave Scroggins directions, but he did not understand them.\u00a0 Scroggins said that he disengaged the hydraulics using the lock-out lever, got up, and began to exit the cab of the excavator.\u00a0 As he exited the cab, he inadvertently hit the swing arm lever, causing the hydraulics to reengage and the bucket to swing toward Schmidt.\u00a0Schmidt was standing with one foot on the crusher drive belt guard and the other on the cone.\u00a0 As the bucket swung, it struck Schmidt in the side, causing him to fall forward off of the crusher.\u00a0 He fell approximately 11 feet to the ground, landing on his head and shoulder.\u00a0 Shaffer and Scroggins saw Schmidt fall and immediately went to his aid.\u00a0 An ambulance was summoned and Schmidt was transported to the hospital.Schmidt suffered severe injuries, including a broken collar bone, a broken neck, a broken back, two broken legs, and broken ribs.\u00a0 After spending several months in the hospital, he was moved to a rehabilitation facility.\u00a0 He was released from the rehabilitation facility in mid-April 2015, but had to return, because a foot wound was not healing properly.\u00a0 Schmidt went into acute respiratory distress, and was transported to the hospital where he died on May 26, 2015.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "Mike Schmidt, the victim\u2019s son, called the Department of Labor\u2019s National Contact Center (DOLNCC) to notify MSHA of the accident at 1:42 p.m. PST on May 13, 2014. \u00a0The DOLNCC notified Patricia Borer, Staff Assistant in MSHA\u2019s Western District, and an investigation started the same day.\u00a0 A non-contributory citation was issued to the mine operator for failure to contact MSHA within 15 minutes of the accident.MSHA's accident investigator traveled to the mine, made a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed employees, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident.\u00a0 MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of the Accident\u00a0\nThe accident occurred in the crusher plant on the TEL SMITH cone crusher trailer during the relining of the cone crusher.Equipment involved in the accident\nThe 790 ELC John Deere excavator involved in the accident uses a series of pedals and levers in the cab to control the machine\u2019s movement and the operation of the excavator arm and bucket.\u00a0 This unit is equipped with a hydraulic lock-out lever to the left of the operator\u2019s seat that disengages the hydraulics so that the unit and implements will not move.\u00a0\u00a0The lever has two positions. \u00a0When the handle is in a 90 degree vertical position, the hydraulics are isolated and the machine controls are not operable. \u00a0When the lever is pushed forward, from a vertical position down to approximately 45 degrees, the machine will move and the arm and bucket will operate.\u00a0 While in the 45 degree (operation) position, the lever partially blocks the exit from the excavator.\u00a0 The lock-out lever and hydraulic controls were tested and functioned properly. \u00a0Weather\u00a0\nThe weather on the day of the accident was mostly clear and sunny.\u00a0 The temperature ranged between 49 degrees in the morning and a high of approximately 79 degrees Fahrenheit in mid-afternoon. \u00a0Weather was not considered to be a contributing factor in the accident.Training and Experience\u00a0\nMichael Schmidt had thirteen years and one week of experience as a Plant Maintenance Mechanic, all at this mine.\u00a0 An in-depth review of the mine operator's training records was conducted.\u00a0 The training records for Schmidt were reviewed and found to be in compliance with MSHA training requirements.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "Investigators conducted a root cause analysis and identified the following root causes:Root Cause: The excavator operator was unable to effectively maintain control of the excavator while exiting the cab of the unit, resulting in the excavator bucket striking the victim.Corrective Action: The operator retrained miners to shut down the unit before exiting the cab.Root Cause:\u00a0 The victim was not wearing any type of fall protection to prevent him from falling from the top of the cone crusher.Corrective Action:\u00a0 Miners were retrained in the proper use of fall protection", "CONCLUSION": "Management failed to ensure that the hydraulic system, on the excavator being used to lift heavy components during repair tasks, was deactivated.\u00a0 This allowed the boom to swing, knocking another miner off of the crusher.\u00a0 Management also failed to ensure that miners were wearing fall protection devices when exposed to the danger of falling.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0"}}, "/data-reports/fatality-reports/2014/fatality-4-5-may-12-2014": {"report-url":

Ayers did not see Reynolds in the truck, which was still running with the headlights on. \u00a0Ayers went to investigate by walking around the truck and then shined his flashlight into the diversion ditch where he saw Reynolds face down in the water.\u00a0Ayers immediately called the \u201c911\u201d emergency phone number at approximately 5:25 a.m., and spoke with the emergency operator until the ambulance arrived.\u00a0 Shortly after the ambulance arrived at the site, a Crime Scene Investigator with the Kanawha County Sheriff\u2019s Department also arrived to conduct an investigation because the accident was determined to be an unwitnessed death.\u00a0The victim\u2019s body was recovered from the diversion ditch by the East Bank Volunteer Fire Department and subsequently taken to the West Virginia State Medical Examiner\u2019s office in Charleston, West Virginia for autopsy.\u00a0 The Chief Medical Examiner concluded the cause of death to be asphyxia due to drowning. \u00a0The toxicology report also showed \u201cMarked alcohol intoxication causing work site impairment; judged contributory to fatal accident scenario.\u201d\u00a0 The victim had a blood alcohol (Ethanol) content of 0.27% at the time he died.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On April 18, 2014 at 5:53 a.m., the accident was reported to MSHA\u2019s National Call Center by Frank Linville. \u00a0At 6:13 a.m., Roy Baker, District 4 Health Supervisor, received notification from the call center that a night shift security guard had been found dead on the property by an employee who had reported for work on the day shift.\u00a0 Baker called the facility and at 6:30 a.m., issued a verbal 103(j) Order to Frank Linville in order to prevent the destruction of evidence and to preserve the accident scene. \u00a0Martin Carver, Supervisory Mine Safety and Health Inspector from the Mt. Carbon Field Office, and Andrew Sedlock, Coal Mine Safety and Health Inspector/Accident Investigator from the Mt. Hope Field Office, were notified of the accident and dispatched to the site.\u00a0 Upon arrival at the facility, the 103(j) Order was reduced to writing and subsequently modified to a 103(k) Order to insure the safety of all persons during the investigation.\u00a0The accident was investigated in conjunction with the West Virginia Office of Miners\u2019 Health Safety and Training (WVOMHST), the Kanawha County Sheriff\u2019s Department, the operator of the facility, the contract operator, and the employees of the operator and contractor.A list of the persons participating in the investigation is shown in Appendix A.", "DISCUSSION": "The diversion ditch where the victim was found was constructed around the perimeter of the coal stockpile area and was approximately 10 feet wide at its base, near the water level. \u00a0The top of the berm where the victim\u2019s pickup truck was located was approximately 6 to 7 feet above the bottom of the ditch, and the sides of the ditch sloped at less than a vertical angle into the bottom of the ditch.\u00a0 The ditch had been recently cleaned out and there was 4 to 12 inches of sediment and water in the bottom of the ditch.\u00a0 The diversion ditch was physically located between the coal stockpile area of the facility and the Kanawha River.The victim\u2019s truck, a 2009 Ford Ranger extended cab pickup, had traveled approximately 15 feet up and onto a road berm (approximately 16 inches in height), that had been constructed around the diversion ditch.\u00a0 The wheels of the truck had straddled the berm and become stuck with the left rear tire just above ground level on the inside of the berm.\u00a0 The truck was found still in gear with the engine running, the headlights on, and the driver\u2019s side door open directly above the diversion ditch.\u00a0 The ground slope from the top of the road berm down to the bottom of the diversion ditch was vegetated and less than vertical in grade.\u00a0 The victim was working alone at the time of the accident.\u00a0 There were no witnesses. \u00a0Based on observations during the investigation, it appears that the victim exited his truck from the driver\u2019s side and slid or fell down the slope into the water at the bottom of the diversion ditch where he was found face down.Following the recovery of the victim\u2019s body, the truck involved was moved by a wrecker to a safe location where it was inspected and tested for any defects.\u00a0 A brake service function test was conducted while the vehicle was in gear at an engine speed of 2000 revolutions per minute (rpm).\u00a0 Steering components on the pickup were also inspected for defects.\u00a0 No mechanical deficiencies with the brakes or steering functions were identified by the inspection.\u00a0Items inside the cab of the pickup truck were examined during the investigation by the Sheriff\u2019s office criminal investigator.\u00a0 These included miscellaneous clothing, a hand held radio, a flashlight, several personal items, and an empty whiskey bottle (approximately 4/5 quart). \u00a0\u00a0Reynolds was an employee of Allied Security. \u00a0He had worked at this location for 12 years as a security guard/supervisor.\u00a0 Reynolds had received Hazard Training for this mine site.\u00a0", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "A root cause analysis was conducted to identify the basic causes of the accident that were correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 Listed below is the cause that was identified by the analysis and the corrective action which was implemented to prevent a recurrence of the accident.Root Cause:\u00a0 A substance abuse screening program which is conducted to check for alcohol or drug abuse on a regular basis, but unannounced, was not in place for security personnel employed at this operation.\u00a0 The victim\u2019s blood alcohol content was found to be 0.27% at the time of his death.Corrective Action:\u00a0 The contractor has put into effect a Drug and Substance Abuse Policy for its employees, including the contract employees utilized at this facility.", "CONCLUSION": "A contract security guard drowned in a diversion ditch containing 4 to 12 inches of sediment and water.\u00a0 The investigators concluded that the victim exited the driver\u2019s side of the truck he was operating and slipped or fell into the diversion ditch where he drowned.\u00a0 Alcohol intoxication causing work site impairment was also identified as a contributing factor.\u00a0 The employer of the security guard did not have in place a substance abuse screening program for its employees at this facility.\n\u00a0Approved By:\u00a0_____________________________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ________________\nDavid S.

Simms, District Manager\n\u00a0OVERVIEWAt approximately 1:07 p.m. on October 5, 2013, Robert E. Smith, a 47-year-old general laborer, was fatally injured at the White County Coal LLC, Pattiki Mine. The victim was traveling out of the mine at the end of his shift. The victim was driving a battery-powered, two-man personnel carrier. Evidence indicates that a diesel-powered vehicle began to push the victim\u2019s personnel carrier, which caused the personnel carrier to overturn on top of Smith. The accident occurred because mine management did not have adequate programs, policies, and procedures in place to ensure safe travel of self-propelled vehicles on outby travelways of the mine.GENERAL INFORMATIONThe Pattiki Mine, I.D. No. 11-03058, is operated by White County Coal, LLC and is located in White County near Carmi, Illinois. The mine began production in the Herrin No. 6 coal seam in March of 2002. The mine has 312 employees, with 275 underground workers.Coal is produced on two shifts daily, five days a week, with an average daily production of 10,703 tons. The mine has eight mechanized mining units (MMUs), which utilize shuttle cars to transport coal from the working face to the belt tail. Conveyor belts transport the coal from the working section to the surface.The last regular safety and health inspection (E01) of the mine was completed by MSHA on September 26, 2013. A regular safety and health inspection was not in progress at the time of the accident. The Non-Fatal Days Lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for the mine operator in 2012 was 3.82, compared to a National NFDL rate of 3.24.The principal officers at this mine at the time of the accident were:Johnny Garrett .......... General Manager\nJoshua Bell .......... Safety Director\nRandy Taylor .......... SuperintendentDESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENTOn Saturday, October 5, 2013, at approximately 1:07 p.m., Smith, (victim) was driving the No. 7 personnel carrier out of the mine at the end of his shift. His shift started at 3:00 a.m. He had been to the No. 2 unit to assist on a power move and to build brattices (stoppings). Smith and Steven Brown, Roof Bolter, left the section at approximately 12:37 p.m. after finishing their work for the day. While traveling out of the mine on the No. 7 battery-powered personnel carrier, they were asked by Chris Buchanan, Mine Manager, to take the Company No. 7359 \u201cBlue Jake\u201d diesel-powered personnel carrier out of the mine. Brown exited the No. 7 personnel carrier at crosscut #23 on the 4th 48 travelway. Smith proceeded in front, driving the battery-powered carrier, and Brown followed him driving the diesel-powered carrier. While traveling out of the mine, at approximately crosscut No. 6 on the 2nd 48 travelway, Brown noticed Smith\u2019s vehicle swerve, hit the left side rib, and then overturn. Smith was trapped under the No. 7 personnel carrier. Brown tried to move the No. 7 carrier to free Smith from under the vehicle. Brown was unable to move the vehicle and radioed for help.Josh Knight, Mine Examiner, heard the call for help and traveled from the mechanic\u2019s shack to the scene of the accident, a distance of approximately 1,500 feet. Knight and Brown tried to lift the overturned personnel carrier to free Smith, but they were unable to move it. They located a timber and used it to pry the personnel carrier upward to free Smith. After Smith was removed from under the personnel carrier, Knight evaluated Smith and did not detect any vital signs. Knight began to perform cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on Smith. Knight continued CPR until the arrival of Biff Mosby, Mechanic. Smith was transported out of the mine by Knight, while Mosby continued CPR until arrival on the surface.The White County Ambulance Service arrived at 1:38 p.m. Upon arrival on the surface, emergency medical service personnel from the ambulance service relieved Mosby. The White County Coroner arrived a short time later. Smith was pronounced dead at 1:59 p.m.INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENTThe MSHA call center was notified of the accident at 1:50 p.m. on October 5, 2013, by Joshua Bell, Safety Director. A citation, which did not contribute to the accident, was issued for a violation of 30 CFR \u00a7 50.10, because MSHA was not notified immediately, at once, without delay, and within 15 minutes. The call center notified Mary Jo Bishop, Assistant District Manager/Enforcement, at the District 8 Office in Vincennes, Indiana. MSHA personnel were immediately dispatched to the mine. A section 103(j) order was issued to ensure the safety of persons at the mine until an investigation could be conducted.The accident investigation was conducted in cooperation with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Mines and Minerals. Photographs and measurements of the accident scene were taken and interviews with four miners and management officials were conducted by the investigation team on the day of the accident. Operational checks of the equipment were performed and additional photographs were taken at the accident site on October 7, 2013. An additional interview was conducted with a miner on October 15, 2013, at the Pattiki Mine office. The on-site portion of the investigation was completed on October 21, 2013. A list of those persons who participated in the investigation is shown in Appendix A of this report.DISCUSSION", "Accident Scene": "The accident occurred on the 2nd 48 travelway, which is the secondary escapeway and a main haulage road for the mine. The specific location of the accident was between crosscuts No. 5 and No. 6 of the travelway. The 2nd 48 travelway at the accident scene was in good condition, with a four-foot elevation difference between crosscut No. 12 and crosscut No. 5. The victim was traveling outby and uphill at the time of the accident. No mine-bottom irregularities were observed in the area. The entry was 21-feet wide, with windrows of coal and rock on each side of the travel way. Loose material from rib sloughage was present in the area where the accident occurred.\nDuring interviews, Brown stated that he saw the No. 7 personnel carrier swerve, hit the left rib (facing outby), and overturn. Brown stated that the left side of the carrier rose and caused the carrier to overturn in a clockwise direction from his position.Evidence at the scene of the accident, however, does not support Brown\u2019s account of the carrier swerving and hitting the rib. There were no visible tire marks or disruption of the soft wind row of raw coal and rock along the left rib to indicate that the carrier hit or ran up on the rib (Appendix B).Additionally, there was a fresh skid mark approximately 14.5 feet in length, that indicated that one tire of the No. 7 personnel carrier skidded in a straight line, with respect to the entry, while the wheels were turned to the left (Appendix B). The tires on this personnel carrier have a unique and pronounced alternating tread. A tire will not leave this type of pattern, unless it was skidding."}}, "/data-reports/fatality-reports/2013/fatality-15-october-4-2013": {"report-url": "https://www.msha.gov/data-reports/fatality-reports/2013/fatality-15-october-4-2013", "accidnet-classification": "Machinery", "location": "McElroy Mine, West Virginia", "mine-type": "Coal", "mine-controller": "CONSOL Energy Inc.", "mined-mineral": "Coal (Bituminous)", "incident-date": "2013-10-04T13:10:00-04:00", "public-notice": "This posting serves to provide a public notice to employees of the mine, employees of the mining company(s), employees of independent contractors with any connection to the mine, persons with any connection to the mine, and any person with information regarding the cause or contributing factors of this accident.

The dozer was pushing overburden in a direction parallel to a pond located 130 feet away. The dozer veered hard to the right and then traveled in a straight line, with the blade raised, toward the pond. The dozer reached the side of the pond and slid sideways to the right approximately 20 feet into the pond.The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) conducted an investigation regarding chargeability of the accident as a mine-related fatality. The accident investigators determined the dozer functioned properly and could not determine what caused the dozer to veer off the path of travel and travel in a straight line for approximately 130 feet. Trevathan did not lower the dozer blade or attempt to make an emergency stop before the dozer entered the water.Information was forwarded to MSHA's Fatality Review Committee (Committee). Based on the results of MSHA's investigation and a review of the available medical documentation, the Committee determined on September 30, 2014, that Trevathan\u2019s death should be charged to the mining industry.The autopsy report and death certificate indicated Trevathan died of a cardiac dysrhythmia due to hypertensive heart disease with submersion in water.", "GENERAL INFORMATION": "Troy Plant, a construction sand and gravel operation owned and operated by Ford Construction Company, is located near Hwy 21 in Troy, Obion County, Tennessee. The principal operating official is John H. Ford, President. The mine normally operates one 10-hour shift per day, five days per week. Total employment is 8 persons.After removal of the overburden, the sand and gravel is loaded into haul trucks, transported to the plant where it is screened, sized and washed. The material is stockpiled and the finished products are sold for use in the construction industry.Prior to the accident, MSHA completed the last regular inspection at this mine on May 17, 2013.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On the day of the accident, July 10, 2013, Joe Trevathan (victim) started to work at 6:00 a.m. Trevathan went to his dozer, located in the sand pit, and started stripping by pushing overburden material to create a new pit. At about the same time, Steve Alexander, Equipment Operator, arrived and drove to the gravel pit to get a motor grader. Alexander operated the motor grader for about 45 minutes. He then went to the sand pit stripping area where Trevathan was working. For about five minutes they discussed the work to be done that day and went to the dozers to strip overburden material.Alexander noticed Trevathan stopped the dozer about 9:30 a.m. After taking a break, Trevathan continued stripping until about 10:45 a.m. when he traveled to get the fuel truck. Trevathan returned with the fuel truck and fueled his and Alexander\u2019s dozers. He then drove the fuel truck to refuel the truck\u2019s tanks which typically takes about 1\u00bd hours. Trevathan returned and about 12:30 p.m., took a 20 minute lunch break with Alexander. After lunch, he continued stripping with the dozer.At approximately 2:00 p.m., Alexander moved his dozer to the spoil bank to level it up. He made four passes with his dozer but could not see Trevathan because he was not facing in the direction where Trevathan was working. When Alexander backed up, he did not see Trevathan\u2019s dozer. He promptly turned the dozer around and started to travel to the area Trevathan was working. As Alexander approached the area, he saw Trevathan\u2019s water cooler floating in the pond. He continued to travel towards Trevathan\u2019s work area and noticed a set of dozer tracks leading to the water\u2019s edge. Alexander exited his dozer and walked toward the water but could not see Trevathan or the dozer.At 2:43 p.m., Alexander phoned Jessie Lewis, Leadman, to contact Brian Bartz, Foreman, to tell him to come to the stripping site because it appeared Trevathan had driven his dozer into the water. Bartz arrived at the site and called 911 for Emergency Medical Assistance (EMS).EMS arrived at 3:08 p.m. and requested a boat and divers to assist in the search for Trevathan. The divers searched the area until dark but could not locate the dozer. Two water pumps were set up on the north end of the pond to pump the water level down.The next morning, July 11, 2013, the water level in the pond had decreased about three feet but the dozer still was not visible. Search efforts resumed and at 1:24 p.m., the divers located Trevathan. He was removed from the water and transported to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. The cause of death was attributed to cardiac dysrhythmia due to hypertensive heart disease with submersion in water.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "On July 10, 2013, MSHA was notified of the accident at 3:08 p.m. by a phone call from Vicki Greer, Scale House Clerk, to Jim Croft, Supervisory Mine Safety and Health Inspector. Croft notified Doniece Schlick, Assistant District Manager. Greer also called MSHA\u2019s National Call Center. An investigation was started the same day. To ensure the safety of all persons, an order was issued pursuant to Section 103(j) of the Mine Act. This order was later modified to Section 103(k) of the Mine Act when the first Authorized Representative arrived at the mine.MSHA\u2019s accident team traveled to the mine, made a physical inspection of the accident scene, interviewed the employees, and reviewed documents and work procedures relevant to the accident. MSHA conducted the investigation with the assistance of mine management and employees.", "DISCUSSION": "Location of the AccidentThe accident occurred at the sand pit stripping area adjacent to the pond.DozerThe dozer involved in the accident is a Caterpillar model D8N track-type tractor that was manufactured in 1994. It is not equipped with a ripper. It is powered by a Caterpillar 3406C six cylinder turbocharged and aftercooled diesel engine with a net 285 horsepower rating. The engine is connected to an automatic transmission with 3 forward and 3 reverse gears.The dozer was recovered from the pond approximately seven weeks after the accident. The blade and the axle shafts were removed to transport the dozer from the accident site to the Ford Construction Company shop for inspection. The axle shafts were reinstalled to perform the brake test described below.The accident investigators examined the dozer for any defects. The dozer was washed to remove the mud. No significant impact or rollover damage was observed. Rust was present in numerous places. Water was present inside the fuel tank, hydraulic oil tank, and engine. Mud was present under the operator\u2019s compartment floor panels that were removed to inspect steering and braking linkages. The dozer\u2019s engine could not be started for the investigation.Service Brake TestSince the dozer could not be operated, the functional test provided in the dozer's operation and maintenance manual could not be performed. The holding ability of the brakes was tested by pulling on the dozer with a rubber-tired front end loader and measuring the holding force of the brakes. Note that with the engine not running, the brake hydraulic release pressure was not available; therefore, the brakes were fully applied. Without hydraulic pressure the transmission was also in neutral.When pulled, the dozer tracks slid on the dirt covered pavement. No slippage of the brakes occurred at a force of approximately 42,400 lbs. At the dozer's test weight of approximately 61,600 lbs. (no blade), the brakes would be capable of holding on at least a 43\u00b0 grade. At the estimated full machine weight (with the blade), the brakes are estimated to hold on at least a 35\u00b0 grade. Since the dozer slid on the pavement rather than the brakes slipping, this test did not determine the full capability of the brakes. However, the test confirmed that a substantial braking force could be developed by the brakes.Brake InspectionThe parking brake control cable and the service brake linkage were inspected. No damage or loose connections were observed. Dimensional checks of the parking brake control cable and service brake linkage did not show any significant deviations from Caterpillar specifications. The parking brake lever was found in the released position at the time of the inspection. The parking brake cable was difficult to manually operate however it could be moved across its expected range of motion. The difficulty in moving the parking brake lever was attributed to the effects of the dozer being submerged in the water after the accident. The service brake pedal and linkages could be moved manually without difficulty.Governor and Decelerator ControlsThe dozer was equipped with a hand-operated governor control lever that was connected to the engine governor through linkages. This lever allowed the operator to set the engine's speed. Pulling the lever toward the operator increased the engine speed and pushing it forward decreased the engine speed. By pushing the lever to its furthest position from the operator, the operator was also able to move the governor to shut off fuel and stop the engine. A decelerator pedal was located next to the service brake pedal. The decelerator pedal was connected to the governor control lever linkage and was used to reduce engine speed when making directional changes.Governor and Decelerator Inspection and TestingThe linkages for the governor control lever and decelerator pedal were inspected. Both the governor control lever and decelerator pedal could be moved manually without difficulty. No damage or loose connections was observed with the governor control lever. The decelerator pedal's connection to its shaft was worn and loose. When pushed down, the decelerator pedal did rotate the shaft to the governor. No functional test of the governor control lever or decelerator pedal could be performed since the engine could not be started.Steering, Transmission, and Blade Systems InspectionFunctional tests of the steering, transmission, and blade systems could not be performed since the engine could not be started. The steering and blade control levers could be moved manually without difficulty. The steering control would return to neutral when released and the blade control would return to the hold position when released The directional control selector and the transmission gear selector, both connected to cables, could not be moved by hand. This was attributed to the effects of the dozer being submerged in the water after the accident. In discussions with Caterpillar, it appeared the directional control selector was in the forward position and the transmission gear selector was either in 1st or 2nd gear.The accident investigators determined no equipment related defects or factors contributed to the accident.", "TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE": "Joe D. Trevathan had 23 years of mining experience. The accident investigators reviewed Trevathan\u2019s training records. They were found to be up-to-date and in compliance with MSHA requirements.", "CONCLUSION": "The accident investigators determined the dozer functioned properly and could not determine what caused the dozer to veer hard to the right off the path of travel and then travel in a straight line for approximately 130 feet toward the pond.

Senior Vice President and Chief Operating OfficerA regular safety and health inspection by MSHA was in progress at the time of the accident.\u00a0 The previous inspection was completed on March 30, 2010. \u00a0The Non Fatal Days Lost (NFDL) incidence rate for the mine in 2009 was 3.68, compared to a national NFDL incidence rate of 4.16 for underground mines.", "DESCRIPTION OF ACCIDENT": "On Wednesday, April 28, 2010, at approximately 3:00 p.m., prior to entering the mine, the second shift crew for the No. 6 Working Section met with the rest of the second shift miners in a group safety meeting held by mine management.\u00a0 After the meeting, the second shift crew entered the mine and traveled to the section located in the 2nd Southeast Panel to relieve the day shift crew. \u00a0Brian Perdue, Section Foreman, held another safety meeting with the crew at the dinner shack prior to the miners starting production.\u00a0 Production began at approximately 3:45 p.m. \u00a0Travis and Carter assumed their normal duties of operating the right side continuous mining machine in entries 0 through 3 Left Crosscut.\u00a0 This is a split air working section with a mechanized mining unit set up on both the left side and right side of the working section.\u00a0 Each side has one continuous mining machine, one roof bolting machine and two shuttle cars.\u00a0 Travis and Carter had cut 1 Left Crosscut when the 36 B Belt pulled apart, interrupting production at approximately 4:29 p.m. \u00a0\u00a0Personnel from the section, including Carter, were sent to help with the belt repair. \u00a0After the belt was repaired, production resumed at approximately 6:22 p.m. \u00a0Travis and Carter mined a 20 foot cut in the No. 0 Entry, opened 3 Left Crosscut and mined the face of No. 3 Entry approximately 38 feet in depth.Travis and Carter were in the process of moving to the next proposed cut in No. 2 Left Crosscut when draw rock (approximately 6 to 12 inches thick) fell in the unbolted face of the No. 3 Entry.\u00a0 The fall was reported by Jeremy Teague and James Gibson, Shuttle Car Operators on the right side. \u00a0Travis informed both Teague and Gibson that he was going to clean up the rock to help the roof bolting machine operators. \u00a0Travis and Carter cleaned up the right side of the No. 3 Entry and had set up to complete loading rock on the left side when the accident occurred at approximately 10:00 p.m.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Gibson left the feeder and stopped two crosscuts outby the face in No. 3 Entry to allow Teague to enter the entry with his shuttle car from the crosscut between the No. 2 and No. 3 Entries. \u00a0Gibson stated that he was looking at the face when he saw the methane monitor on the mining machine and the two cap lights of the miner operator and helper go \u201cblack.\u201d \u00a0Teague proceeded into the No. 3 Entry, where he encountered dust from an apparent roof fall. \u00a0He got out of his shuttle car and observed the roof fall on the continuous mining machine cable. \u00a0Teague ran to the No. 3 Left Crosscut, in hope that Travis and Carter had escaped to safety. \u00a0After not seeing Travis or Carter, Teague called for Perdue to come to the No. 3 Entry.\u00a0 Gibson observed Teague running and calling for Perdue over the radio. \u00a0Gibson, along with R.J. Oliver and Quentin White, the Right Side Roof Bolting Machine Operators, ran toward the face of the No. 3 Entry, where they observed Teague pulling rock from the fall by hand. \u00a0White notified the other section crew members of the accident (See Drawing of Accident Site, Page 1). \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0David Brown, Mine Foreman, had just arrived on the section, when he was notified of the accident.\u00a0 Brown instructed Jason Bratcher, Section Mechanic, to call outside and have someone notify all appropriate authorities and company officials. \u00a0Bratcher was then assigned to monitor the mine phone and all communication systems on the section to relay accurate information and to facilitate the rescuers\u2019 needs.", "INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT": "At 10:28 p.m. Abel DeLeon, MSHA District 10 Field Office Supervisor was notified by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) Hotline operator of an accident at the Dotiki Mine.\u00a0 The caller indicated there were two people entrapped by a roof fall on the No. 6 Section.\u00a0 A 103(j) Order was issued over the phone.\u00a0 MSHA District 10 personnel, including Carl E. Boone II, District Manager, Ted Smith, Assistant District Manager and Troy Davis, Staff Assistant/Accident Coordinator were alerted to the mine emergency.\u00a0 At 11:20 p.m. William Barnwell and Archie Coburn, District 10 Coal Mine Inspectors, were dispatched to the mine to initiate the accident investigation and assist as needed with rescue operations.On Friday April 30, 2010, Barnwell and Coburn, along with David Winebarger, District 10 Roof Control Specialist, Mike Gauna, from MSHA\u2019s Technical Support Roof Control Division, plus Greg Goins and Tim Fugate, Kentucky Office of Mine Safety and Licensing (OMSL) Accident Investigators, traveled to the accident scene to take measurements and photographs.\u00a0 Interviews were held at the Dotiki III Training Center on Saturday, May 1; Tuesday, May 4; and Wednesday, May 5. \u00a0\u00a0A total of 31 miners and mine management officials were interviewed.", "DISCUSSION": "Initial Accident Response:Winebarger and James Hackney, District 10 Roof Control Supervisor, were dispatched to assist with ongoing rescue operations.\u00a0 Boone reported to the command center, located at the Dotiki IV training room, to assist in directing the rescue operation.\u00a0 Secure communication from the No. 6 Section had already been established.\u00a0 Alliance management and OMSL personnel were also present in the command center. \u00a0MSHA, OMSL, and company personnel participated in monitoring and direction of the rescue operation.\u00a0 Robert Gray, District 10 Family Liaison, was dispatched to the Family Center, located at the Nebo Baptist Church in Nebo, KY.\u00a0 The mine operator had Melody Wilson and Eric Anderson, company employees, as their family liaisons at the Family Center.\u00a0 The entrances to the mine and Family Center were secured by KY State Police and Hopkins County Sheriff personnel.\u00a0Upon arrival at the Dotiki Mine, Smith, Hackney and Winebarger traveled to the accident scene to assess the rescue efforts and assist with measures taken to protect the miners working to reach Travis and Carter.\u00a0 The efforts were hampered by the orientation of the loose rock from the roof fall and other hazards of the roof outby the fall.\u00a0 Additional roof support was installed and specialized equipment was constructed and utilized to remove loose rock as remotely as possible (See Appendix B, Exhibit 1).\u00a0 The second shift crew of No. 6 Section departed at about 5:30 a.m. Thursday, April 29, 2010, while other rescuers continued efforts to reach the miners.\u00a0 As rock was removed, Michael Carter was located and recovered at 2:05 p.m. and taken to the surface.\u00a0 At 2:24 p.m. Justin Travis was located.\u00a0 Travis was recovered at 5:25 p.m. and taken to the surface.Dotiki Mine Layout:Most of the mine personnel access the mine via the Dotiki IV Portal, located approximately 2 miles north of Nebo, in Hopkins County, Kentucky.\u00a0 The portal is a 685 feet shaft situated off Balls Hill Road (State Route 502) at 37.4049\u00b0 north latitude and 87.6332\u00b0 west longitude.\u00a0 There are 10 MMUs in the Dotiki Mine.\u00a0 Coal is extracted from the West Kentucky No. 9 Coal Seam (also known as the Springfield Coal Seam) and from the West Kentucky No. 11 Coal Seam (also known as the Herrin Coal Seam).\u00a0\u00a0 Six MMUs (Section Nos. 1, 3 and 6) operate in the No. 9 Seam and four MMUs (Sections No.s 2 and 4) operate in the No. 11 Seam.No. 6 Section:The entries are numbered from right-to-left, with the far right entry designated \u201cNo. 0\u201d and the far left entry \u201cNo. 8.\u201d\u00a0 Mining is conducted with two radio remote control continuous mining machines operating independently on two separate air splits. \u00a0The right side machine is used to mine the No. 0 to No. 3 Entries, and typically the crosscut between the No. 3 and No. 4 Entries.\u00a0 The mining machine on the left side of the section is used to mine the No. 4 to No. 8 Entries.\u00a0 Two coal transporter cars, a dual boom roof bolting machine, and a scoop are assigned to each mining machine.\u00a0 The accident involved the right side continuous mining machine and occurred in the No. 3 Entry at the projected position for Crosscut 26 (no crosscut had been turned).The No. 6 Section was mining the 2nd SE Panel off 2nd NE Sub-Mains.\u00a0 The 2nd SE Panel is oriented approximately S70\u00b0E and is being developed in the southeastern direction. \u00a0The section is nine entries wide with the entries on 70 foot centers and crosscuts on 70 foot centers.\u00a0 Overall development width of the panel is approximately 580 feet.\u00a0 Overburden across the face area inby the feeder ranges from 875 to 900 feet.\u00a0 Overburden was gradually decreasing to the southeast.\u00a0 The No. 9 Coal Seam in the area dips to the northeast (N33\u00b0E) at 3.4% grade.\u00a0 No under mining or over mining with older workings exists in the vicinity of the No. 6 Section.The No. 6 Section (2nd SE Panel) is bordered to the northeast by the recently completed nine-entry 3rd SE Panel and bordered to the southwest by the projected ten-entry 1st SE Panel.\u00a0 At the time of the accident, the 2nd SE panel had completed approximately 1,400 feet of the projected 2,280 feet of development.\u00a0 Approximately 13 crosscuts remained to be mined and the panel was to terminate at the mined out old No. 3 Section (now sealed).\u00a0 The previous 3rd SE panel had completed its entire 2,800 feet projected distance and had terminated at the sealed old No. 3 Section. (See Appendix B, Exhibit 2)\u00a0 After the fatal roof fall accident, a decision was made by the mine operator to relocate the No. 6 Section outby the roof fall area.Physical Description of the Accident Site:The fatal accident site is located in the No. 3 Entry, approximately 83 feet inby Spad (survey station) 78566 and approximately 223 feet inby the No. 6 Section belt feeder (set in No. 4 Entry, Crosscut 22).\u00a0 The outby edge of the roof fall along the right side of the No. 3 Entry was 2 feet inby the intersection of Crosscut 25.\u00a0 The outby edge of the roof fall along the left side of the No. 3 Entry was 18 feet inby the intersection of Crosscut 25.\u00a0 The outby edge of the roof fall was oriented diagonally across the entry at approximately N70\u00b0E.\u00a0 Prior to the accident, Crosscut 25 had been completed by mining into the No. 4 Entry (See Appendix B, Exhibit 3, Location of Miners and Equipment at Time of Accident).\u00a0 The No. 3 Entry at the accident site had been mined approximately 19.8 feet wide.\u00a0 The mining height was approximately 60 inches (See Drawing of Accident Site, Page 1).The maximum visible portion of the roof fall cavity extended approximately 10 feet above the coal.\u00a0 The roof fall extended rib-to-rib across the entry.\u00a0 During the rescue activity, roof fall rubble had been removed to where approximately 24 feet of cavity length was exposed, as measured along the entry center line.\u00a0 The fall rubble obstructed viewing the roof fall cavity walls beyond the exposed 24 feet length of the fall.\u00a0 The roof fall cavity was approximately 10 feet maximum height, 19.8 feet width, and up to 76 feet in length, assuming the fall extended the full length of the reported cut depth (See Appendix B, Exhibit 4).At the time of the accident, the continuous mining machine was positioned to clean draw rock from the left side of the cut and awaiting the next shuttle car.\u00a0 The head of the continuous mining machine was positioned inby the last row of roof bolts.\u00a0 The mining machine operator and helper were last observed by Gibson to be positioned and working under the third row of roof bolts outby the unbolted cut, approximately 8 feet from last row of roof bolts.\u00a0 This location referenced by Gibson was after his (Gibson\u2019s) shuttle car had been loaded and he was en route to the feeder.\u00a0 The two miners were recovered approximately 7 feet and 16 feet, respectively, outby their last observed work positions.Geology:At the accident site, the immediate mine floor consisted of claystone.\u00a0 The two nearest core holes (2,150 feet northwest and 5,400 feet northeast of the accident site) indicate that the claystone is at least 2.5 feet thick.\u00a0 In the western portion of the roof fall, the coal seam is approximately 5.0 feet thick with roughly 0.5 foot of claystone floor removed.\u00a0 At the outby perimeter of the roof fall, the immediate black shale roof had not been mined.\u00a0 The strata exposed in the fall cavity indicates that the immediate roof consisted of approximately 1.3 feet of black shale, (common for the No. 9 Seam, locally referred to as \u201cblack slate\u201d) overlain by 3.4 feet of gray shale containing pyrite nodules, and then overlain by at least 5.3 feet of gray shale and sandy shale with slickensides (also referred to as \u201cslips\u201d) evident in the overlying gray shale and sandy shale (See Appendix B, Exhibit 5).\u00a0 The slickensides were randomly oriented, discontinuous, and curvilinear (represented by a curved line).\u00a0 They appear to be features formed from the deposition, then later compaction, of the shale/sandy shale sequence.\u00a0 The gray shale/sandy shale beds exposed in the fall rubble range from 1 foot, to 2.5 feet thick and were intersected by the randomly oriented slickensides.\u00a0 At least six different slickenside orientations at various dip angles were noted in the roof fall cavity walls.\u00a0 The general trend of the slickensides was S25\u00b0E to S50\u00b0E at dip angle from near vertical to flat lying.\u00a0 The slickensides, in the portion of the roof fall cavity that could be investigated, did not project into or through the black shale above the coal seam. \u00a0The slickensides cut through and dismembered the gray shale and sandy shale beds in the horizon above the coal seam (area above the black shale), for a distance of 1.3 feet, up to 10 feet. \u00a0The slickenside features were noted to the top of the roof fall cavity.\u00a0 No water was evident either in the roof fall rubble or in the fall cavity walls.Roof Control Plan Requirements for No. 6 Section:The remote controlled continuous mining machine cycle uses a 40-foot deep cut plan, where the furthest penetration inby the last full row of permanent roof support shall be no greater than 40 feet.\u00a0 Reportedly, the operation typically mines a 38-foot deep cut depth.\u00a0 A minimum of two cuts are required to mine the crosscuts with the 70-foot crosscut centers on No. 6 Section.\u00a0 Pillar recovery is not conducted. \u00a0Mining width is a maximum of 20 feet, and is normally between 19 to 20 feet.\u00a0 Primary roof support consisted of 3/4-inch diameter, grade 40, 5-foot fully-grouted, deformed bar roof bolts installed with 2 x 8 x 24-inch wood header boards and 6 x 6-inch bearing plates. Roof bolt spacing distance is 4.5 to 5 feet between bolts within the row, with a minimum of four bolts per row.\u00a0 Spacing between the outside bolts and the pillar rib is a maximum 3.5 feet.\u00a0 The rows of bolts are installed on a 4-foot, row-to-row spacing.\u00a0 The mine\u2019s roof control plan required additional roof support in areas with overburden greater than 800 feet, consisting of a minimum 8-foot cable bolts, installed in a \u201cstar pattern\u201d (See Appendix B, Exhibit 6) in all intersections.\u00a0 Primary support in the No. 5 Entry supply road consisted of 5-foot, fully-grouted roof bolts and 8-foot cable bolts installed in every other row of bolts on an \u201cin and out pattern\u201d (See Appendix B, Exhibit 7).\u00a0Drilling of roof test holes was not required in the mining area where the roof fall accident occurred. \u00a0Test holes were required for areas where adverse roof conditions were being encountered, or in areas that had been idled for more than 14 calendar days. The mine operator was installing cable bolts as supplemental roof support.\u00a0 The eight foot cable bolt holes were considered a test hole, because the holes were three feet longer than the primary roof bolts required by the approved plan. \u00a0Six cable bolts were installed in the section intersections according to the approved roof control plan.Roof Conditions and Roof Support on No. 6 Section:A traverse of the No. 6 Section face areas revealed five slickenside features visible in the black shale immediate roof, one in each of the No. 0, No. 2, No. 4, No. 5, and No. 7 Entries.\u00a0 No slickenside features were noted in the No. 3 Entry accident site outby the roof fall.\u00a0 The slickenside features in the No. 2, No. 4, No. 5, and No. 7 Entries did not resemble the features noted in the roof fall cavity.\u00a0 They were oriented at N42\u00b0E to N78\u00b0E and consistently dipped to the southeast.\u00a0 They were tight, singular features, and oriented diagonally across the entry. \u00a0As a result, there was not a potential for roof failure to propagate along the entry.\u00a0 The slickenside in No. 0 Entry was a singular feature, oriented S45\u00b0E, an orientation that could propagate roof failure along the entry. \u00a0The mine operator reportedly reduced the No. 0 Entry cut depth to approximately 20 feet and the slickenside feature was supported and controlled with supplemental 8-foot cable bolts installed on both sides of the feature.\u00a0 Miners also stated during the accident investigation interviews that the cut in No. 0 Entry was reduced to approximately 20 feet.\u00a0 The slickenside feature in the No. 0 Entry had been supported with supplemental 8-foot cable bolts installed on both sides of the feature.\u00a0 Reportedly, supplemental roof support had not been installed in the No. 3 Entry roof fall area.\u00a0After the roof fall and during the rescue/recovery operation, the roof in the No. 3 Entry outby the roof fall deteriorated gradually.\u00a0 A fracture propagated along the right rib from the fall cavity for roughly 25 feet.\u00a0 Roof buckling was evident for approximately 70 feet outby the fall cavity.\u00a0 Roof control was maintained in the No. 3 entry outby the fall by installing 0.6-inch-diameter x 8-foot-long cable bolts with 8-inch x 8-inch bearing plates at the vicinity of the fall cavity.\u00a0 Wood posts, wood cribs and Heintzmann 100- Ton Alternative Crib Support (ACS) were installed along the No. 3 Entry and roof trusses were installed across the entry outby, to the four-way intersection at Spad 78566.The mine site roof fall map indicated that the four closest roof falls were situated 1,100 to 1,430 feet from the accident site.\u00a0 Two of these roof falls were southeastward 1,125 to 1,430 feet away, located in the old No. 3 Section (now sealed) and two roof falls were southwestward 1,200 to 1,380 feet away in the 1st NW Sub-Mains.\u00a0 The mine operator sealed old No. 3 Section, 920 feet to the southeast of the accident site because of wet roof conditions and roof falls associated with these conditions.\u00a0 No wet roof conditions existed in the No. 6 Section face area where the roof fall occurred.\u00a0 No wet roof conditions were reported in the nine previously mined No. 6 Section panels surrounding the 2nd NE Sub-Mains. \u00a0Additionally, no reportable roof falls had occurred in the No. 6 Section mining area since late summer 2008.\u00a0 The mine roof fall map indicated that because of the addition of the intersection supplemental support plan (installed in a \u201cstar pattern\u201d at depths greater than 800 feet); there was a decrease in reportable roof falls.\u00a0 Since the intersection support plan has been implemented in this portion of the reserve, one roof fall has been reported (See Appendix B, Exhibit 2).The No. 6 Section pillars and floor showed no evidence of unusual pillar or floor stress.\u00a0 MSHA calculations employing the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Analysis of Retreat Mining Pillar Stability (ARMPS) software, using a 5.5-ft. mining height, 900 ft. of overburden, and ARMPS default physical properties, resulted in a development mining ARMPS pillar stability factor of 1.77, which meets NIOSH guidelines for stable pillars.\u00a0The No. 6 Section crosscuts showed a tendency for horizontal stress induced roof fractures, which are typical for No. 9 Seam roof when oriented near to north-south.\u00a0 The operator was controlling the roof in the crosscuts by installing the additional 8-foot cable bolts in conjunction with the 5-foot fully-grouted bolts.\u00a0 The regional maximum principle horizontal stress is oriented at N80\u00b0E.\u00a0 The NIOSH Analysis of Horizontal Stress in Mining (AHSM) program indicates that the crosscuts have a moderate to difficult orientation for horizontal stress fractures.\u00a0 The entries have a moderate to good orientation for horizontal stress fractures.\u00a0 This explains the general lack of horizontal stress fractures in the entries, compared to the crosscuts.Summary:Hidden slickensides (slips) were present in the face of the No. 3 Entry of No. 6 Section.\nThe unsupported area above the fresh cut, mined in the No. 3 Entry face, allowed the overlying roof that was weakened by slickensides (\u201cslips\u201d) to break the layers of strata.\nA massive section of roof, up to 76 feet long, 19 feet wide, and a maximum 10 feet thick, fell on the area that included the continuous mining machine and its operators.\nThe Approved Roof Control Plan was being complied with at the time of the accident.\nTraining:Joe Fritz, Mine Safety and Health Training Specialist, of MSHA Educational and Field Services (EFS), conducted an examination of the miners\u2019 training records. \u00a0All training was current and met MSHA Part 48(a) requirements for underground training.", "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS": "An analysis was conducted to identify the most basic cause of the accident that was correctable through reasonable management controls.\u00a0 During the analysis, a root cause was identified that, if eliminated, may have either prevented the accident or mitigated its consequences.The root cause listed below was identified during the analysis and the corresponding corrective actions proposed by mine management to prevent a recurrence of the accident:Root Cause:\u00a0 The mine operator failed to detect the presence of slickensides, which dismembered the overlying shale and sandy shale beds and caused the roof to fall.Corrective Action:\u00a0 In areas where the overburden is greater than 750 feet, mine management proposed and will install a robust support system, in the vicinity of the last row of bolts, to prevent a roof fall that initiates in the unbolted cut from extending outby and exceeding the capacity of the roof support system.\u00a0 This corrective measure and other roof support measures designed to bolster the existing support system were approved by MSHA in a supplement to the mine operator\u2019s Approved Roof Control Plan, including:\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Four 10-foot cable bolts will be installed between the last two rows of bolts to supplement the primary roof support system.\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Entry width reduced to 19 feet.\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Cut depth measured from last 10-foot cable bolt.\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Newly exposed roof will be bolted within 3 hours of coal removal.", "CONCLUSION": "The two fatalities occurred when the mine encountered an anomaly of multiple hidden intersecting slickensides, commonly referred to as \u201cslips,\u201d which were not detected by the mine operator.\u00a0 The most likely fall propagation mode was roof failure in the unbolted cut that had the momentum to pull down the roof in the bolted portion of the entry where the miners were working.\u00a0 The bolted portion of the entry also had non-visible or hidden slickensides in the overlying bolted strata that weakened the overlying rock beds and allowed the bolted roof to be pulled down where the miners were working.\u00a0 The absence of any sign of \u201cslips\u201d in the immediate roof gave no warning for the need to install supplemental or additional support.\u00a0Approved By:\u00a0_____________________\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 _________________Carl E.

While the victim was waiting near the bottom of the Eagle 1 Slope, the brakeman car along with a 14 ton locomotive and loaded rail car was being pulled up the slope to the surface. At about 420 feet from the \u00a0collar of the slope, the rope attached to the brakeman car broke and the trip ran away. The victim was struck by the run away trip resulting in fatal injuries.\n\u00a0\nGENERAL INFORMATION\n\u00a0\nEagle Mine is an underground coal mine located on Fields Creek Road, six miles off Route 1, near Winifrede, Kanawha County, West Virginia. Production began at the mine in 1969. It was operated separately by Carbon Fuel and U S Steel Mining Company until 1985. Wayne Processing Inc. re-opened the mine on February 1, 1999, and Newtown Energy, Inc. began operating the mine on March 2, 2000. The mine is accessed through a slope located at Fields Creek Road and a shaft located on Spice Lick off Joes Creek, 4.5 miles off Route 3 near Comfort, Boone County, West Virginia. The mine is ventilated with one blowing fan. The mine liberates approximately 1,000,000 cubic feet of methane every 24 hours.\nCoal is being extracted from the Eagle Coal Seam.\n\u00a0\nThe mine employs approximately 200 persons, and is not represented by a labor organization. An average of 4,000 tons of coal is produced daily from three sections that utilize continuous mining machines. Coal is transported from the working sections to the surface via a series of belt conveyors. The mine produces coal two shifts per day, five days per week. The track is used to transport \u00a0miners, supplies, materials, and equipment, into and out of the mine. The principal officers for the mine at the time of the accident were:\n\u00a0\nRobert E Ellis.......................................................................................................President\nRichard Asebes ................................................................................... Manager of Mines\nJamie Dotson............................................................................................ Superintendent\nBobbie Harper.............................................................................General Mine Foreman\nJames Loving ............................................................................................ Safety Director\n\u00a0\nThe last regular Safety and Health Inspection (E01) was completed on September 30, 2009. The non-fatal days lost (NFDL) injury incidence rate for 2009 for the mine was 7.31, compared to a National NFDL rate of 4.26 for a mine of this type.\n": "\u00a0", "\nDESCRIPTION OF THE ACCIDENT\n\u00a0\nOn Monday, October 26, 2009, at approximately 11:30 p.m., Charles Dixon (victim) and Daniel Ewing, both trackmen, started their shift at the Eagle Slope Portal. They were assigned to go to the No. 2 Section and remove track, two crosscuts in length, and load the rails on a rail car. The rail car that was needed was located on the surface at the supply yard. Dixon rode the brakeman car to the bottom of the slope, retrieved a 14 ton locomotive that was located near the bottom of the slope and coupled it to the brakeman car. Ewing waited on the surface. When the locomotive arrived on the surface, Dave Morgan, third shift hoist operator, assisted Ewing in coupling the rail car to the locomotive. The brakeman car, the locomotive, and the rail car were sent to the bottom of the slope, and Ewing rode the brakeman car as it was being sent down.\n\u00a0\nEwing met Dixon at the bottom of the slope and they uncoupled the locomotive and rail car and took them to the No. 2 Section. After the track was removed and the rails and other components of the track were loaded on the rail car, they were directed to take the rails to the surface where they could be stored.\n\u00a0\nEwing and Dixon arrived at the bottom of the slope at approximately 6:45 a.m., and met with Morgan, who had conducted a pre-shift examination of the slope belt and was returning to the surface. The locomotive and rail car were to be taken to the surface, the rail car set in the supply yard, and the locomotive sent back to the bottom of the slope where it could be taken to be charged. Ewing and Morgan entered the brakeman car, Ewing in the front seat and Morgan in the second, and started up the slope. Dixon waited at the bottom of the slope near the hoist control station to take the locomotive to the charging station when it \u00a0was sent back down. When the brakeman car travelled to a location approximately 420 feet from the surface, the rope broke and the trip ran away back down the slope. Morgan yelled to Ewing to push the button to engage the brakes. Ewing pushed the button and they both jumped from the car.\n\u00a0\nRichard Lambert, day shift hoist operator, and Mike Tabor, day shift beltman, were in the hoist control room waiting on their shift to start. Lambert saw a warning light on the control panel. He discovered that the slack rope switch had been engaged. They then discovered that the hoist rope had broken. Lambert used the mine phone and Tabor used the tracking phone to call the bottom of the slope; however, they did not receive a response. Lambert then notified mine management at the Spice Lick Portal. Tabor started down the slope and met Morgan coming out of the slope and assisted him to the surface.\n\u00a0\nTabor went to the bottom of the slope and discovered extensive damage to the track, ventilation door, cables, brakeman car, locomotive, and rail car. The brakeman car, locomotive, and rail car de-railed and the rail car stopped\n": "\u00a0", "\napproximately 260 feet inby where the brakeman car normally stops. He found Ewing in a confused state looking for Dixon where the trip had de-railed. Dixon was located approximately 30 feet inby the locomotive, lying unresponsive on \u00a0the mine floor next to the left rib. Tabor and Ewing then went to the waiting area on the 1 East track.\n\u00a0\nAfter learning of the accident, Rick Asebes, mine manager, Bobby Harper, mine foreman, and Larry Boggs, maintenance superintendent, drove from Splice Lick Portal to the Eagle Portal and went down the slope to the accident scene. Mike Herndon, foreman, and Sammy Gore, compliance coordinator, traveled to the accident scene. Wilson Goad, third shift foreman, and Josh Hager and Chris Holstein, general laborers, came to the accident scene as well.\n\u00a0\nGoad, who is an EMT, and others at the scene checked Dixon and no vital signs were detected. First aid was administered to Ewing and he was transported to the Spice Lick Portal by Gore and Herndon, via rail mounted personnel carrier. Once Ewing was on the surface, Gore and Herndon went back to the accident scene and Dixon was transported to the surface by Asebes, Gore, and Herndon.\n\u00a0\nDixon was transported by the Whitesville Fire and Rescue Ambulance to the Whitesville Fire Station in Whitesville, West Virginia, and the State Medical Examiners Office transported him to the State Examiners office in South Charleston, West Virginia. Ewing and Morgan were transported by ambulance to Charleston Area Medical Center, General Division, in Charleston, West Virginia, where they were treated and released.\n\u00a0\nINVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT\n\u00a0\nMSHA was notified of the accident through the National Call Center at 7:00 a.m., on October 27, 2009. A 103(j) Order was issued orally to the mine operator at \u00a07:10 a.m., to protect the safety of all persons at the mine. MSHA accident investigators were dispatched to the mine and the 103(j) Order was reduced to writing and then modified to a 103(k) Order. The investigation was conducted in cooperation with the West Virginia Office of Miners\u2019 Health, Safety, and Training (WVMHST). A list of those persons participating in the investigation can be found in Appendix A of this report. Personnel from MSHA Technical Support and MSHA Educational Field Services participated in the investigation.\n\u00a0\nDISCUSSION\n\u00a0\nUHOIST OPERATION AND WARNING DEVICES\nThe hoist could be operated in either manual or automatic mode. At the time of the accident, the hoist was being operated in automatic mode. In automatic mode, miners could push buttons at the top and bottom of the slope to bring the\n": "\u00a0\nhoist to the loading locations. Then, miners could push a button to raise or lower the hoist.\n\u00a0\nVisible and audible warning devices were located on the surface near the slope, near the bottom of the slope, and near the designated waiting area underground at the 1 East track. A sign was posted on a crib near the designated waiting area that stated \u201cMantrip waiting area. Stay clear of track while waiting for hoist car\u201d. \u00a0The operator\u2019s policy was that when these devices were activated, miners \u00a0at the bottom of the slope were to leave the danger zone and go to the designated waiting area away from the slope. According to Newtown management, this policy was orally communicated to miners during safety discussions. However, it was determined during interviews that not all miners were aware of the policy and the policy was not always complied with. The underground loading location, where the button was located to raise or lower the hoist, was at least 380 feet outby the underground designated waiting area. Miners normally positioned themselves in a dangerous location at the bottom of the slope when men and material were being hoisted into and out of the mine.\n\u00a0\nThe visible warning devices were yellow-flashing lights, one on the surface and two underground. Two lights were located at the brakeman car designated parking positions where miners loaded, one on the surface, and one underground. The third light was located underground at the designated waiting area. When the hoist start button was actuated to lower the hoist, the lights flashed continuously until the trip arrived at its designated parking position and actuated the bottom approach limit switch which deenergized the hoist motor. The lights also flashed when the hoist was moving in the \u201cup\u201d direction.\n\u00a0\nAudible warning devices were buzzer type and located at two locations at the bottom of the slope, the brakeman car designated parking position and at the designated waiting area. When the hoist button was actuated, the warning device alarmed for 10 seconds.\n\u00a0\nThe audible and visible warning devices located at the designated parking position underground were destroyed in the accident resulting in the system being inoperative. During interviews a statement was made that the visible warning devices functioned properly. Those interviewed could not remember if the audible device was working.\n\u00a0\nSLOPE AND HOIST EQUIPMENT\n\u00a0\nSlope\nThe slope entry is divided into two compartments by a vertical cinder block wall. The track is on the left side facing inby, and is used to hoist personnel and material into and out of the mine. A conveyor belt is on the right side and is used to convey coal out of the mine. The track entry side of the slope was an alternate escapeway and was a mechanical escape facility. The zero distance point for the hoisting system was located at the sheave wheel approximately 36 feet from the outside of the hoist house. The slope collar is located approximately 154 feet from the sheave wheel. The slope dips at a 16\u00ba angle and is approximately 1,500 feet long to a track curve. The track curve is part of the slope and turns left when facing inby. The curve is a slight turn that is approximately 20\u00ba. After the center of the curve, the slope extends approximately 20 feet to the bottom of the slope. The 1 East track is located approximately 390 feet from the turn. When the accident scene was examined, all of the wreckage was located between the turn in the slope and the 1-East track.\n\u00a0\nAn examination of the environmental conditions of the slope was conducted on October 30, 2009. Starting from the zero point in the hoisting system (sheave wheel), the following conditions were noted.\n\u00a0\n154 feet - Slope Collar\n530 feet - Water between rails\n619-635 feet - Wet between rails\n740 feet - Water dripping from roof of slope\n1180-1227 feet - Water dripping from roof\n1230-1380 feet - Not very wet\n1380-1410 feet - Water between rails\n1530 feet - Dry (appears to have been rock dusted)\n1750 feet - Curve in track (Stopping Point)\n\u00a0\nHoist\nThe hoist was manufactured by Ottumwa Iron Works. It was refurbished in 1999 and upgraded in 2001. The hoist is equipped with overspeed, overwind, automatic stop controls, and two independent braking systems. The braking systems include the drive motor brake and jaw-type brake on the hoist drum.\nThe jaw brake is gravity applied and electrically released. Overspeed is monitored by a Lilly Controller which is mechanically connected to the hoist drum and upon activation removes power to the hoist and sets the brakes in the system. The hoist speed is also programmed into the programmable logic control (PLC) system. The top hoist speed was approximately 400 feet per minute \u00a0\u00a0(fpm). The system also has current overload protection. Overwind was also provided by the Lilly controller, and overwind back-up (redundancy) was provided by magnetic switches (top and bottom) activated by the brakeman car. The hoist was also equipped with a slack rope switch located at the window of the hoist house and a switch located at the top of the drum to detect any piling \u00a0up of the rope on the drum. If these switches were actuated, the drive motor was deenergized and the brakes are set.\n\u00a0\nWire rope\nThe hoist wire rope, installed on June 22, 2007, was identified as a 1-1/8 inch diameter 6 X 30 STY G RL XXIP FC SL wire rope.\n\u00a0\nThe breaking strength for this rope was listed as 70.1 tons in the Wire Rope Users Manual, 4th\u00a0Edition. Company personnel provided a certificate from the Wire Rope Corporation of America indicating that the rope had an actual breaking strength of 78.1 tons. The minimum design factor required under Title 30 CFR Part 75.1431(a) was determined to be 5.4 based on a slope length of 1,600 feet.\nThe weight of load being hoisted at the time of the accident, met the design requirements for the rope installed.\nThe rope was terminated with an open type zinc poured socket. After traveling over a sheave wheel located 36 feet from the outside of the hoist house, the load end of the termination was connected to a brakeman car. The 60 inch (outside diameter) sheave wheel rotated on a lubricated shaft that was 58 inches long. The sheave wheel could travel freely along the entire length of the shaft, as the rope was spooled onto and off of the hoist drum.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nConveyance\nThe conveyance consisted of the brakeman car, locomotive, and loaded rail car. The battery powered locomotive was used to couple the loaded rail car to the brakeman car.\nThe brakeman car was a Sanford Day Model BSD brakeman car. It is equipped with six electromagnetic brakes that can be applied manually or automatically. When activated, the electromagnets are energized and clamp down onto both metal rails due to magnetic attraction. This provides a braking force that can stop the brakeman car and the rest of the conveyance up to a certain load. Visual evidence (slight wear markings on the tops of the rails) was present on the rail surfaces, indicating that the brakeman car\u2019s electromagnetic brakes had been applied approximately 500 feet from the slope collar. These marks continued intermittently for several hundred feet down the slope.\nThe weight of the conveyance exceeded the braking capacity of the brakeman car. The conveyance weight, which included the weight of the brakeman car, was 32.17 tons. Assuming the best possible conditions, including dry rails, the maximum possible load that the brakeman car could have stopped was 26.95 tons. Under the actual conditions present, the maximum load should not have exceeded 18.3 tons. This assumes a 20% safety factor, wet rail conditions, and an optimal brake reaction time of 0.43 seconds.\nA visual examination was conducted on the brakeman car after it was removed from the mine and transported to the surface. The rollback switch functioned as designed. The overspeed centrifugal switches were also examined. The housings for both switches had been destroyed in the accident and the contacts for the switches were also destroyed or missing. One of the switches rotated freely and the other appeared to have a bent shaft which prevented it from turning completely. The \u201cV\u201d belts connecting the switches to the wheels were in place. A visual examination was conducted on the six wear bars located at each brake. All six wear bars showed evidence of wear. The control panel was extensively damaged in the accident. No determination could be made concerning the position of the \u201cUp/Down\u201d switch at the time of the accident.\nDuring normal operation, when the switch is in the Down Position, rollback is disabled so that the car can be lowered. However, the car could be hoisted in either direction with the switch in the Down direction.\n\u00a0\nWIRE ROPE FAILURE\nThe wire rope failed at a point approximately 575 feet from the load attachment on the brakeman car as the trip was being pulled to the surface. The failure point occurred as the rope traveled over the sheave wheel located outside the hoist house. This was indicated by the number of broken wires found under the sheave wheel, the presence of core fibers, and small wire segments embedded in the lubricant on the sheave wheel, and the length of rope remaining on the hoist drum. Broken wires were gathered from the grease on the sheave and on the ground just below the sheave wheel. They included center strand pieces along with individual wires.\nThe hoist house and the wire rope remaining on the hoist drum were examined on the day of the accident. Three sections of the rope: the end of the 4th\u00a0layer which extends to the failed end of the rope, a section approximately 14 wraps into the 3rd\u00a0layer, and a section 19 wraps into the 3rd\u00a0layer, were dry and showed no evidence of lubrication. The failed end was wet (from rain water) and no evidence of lubrication was present on this section of rope.\n\nThe outer wires of each strand of the failed end were worn. Many of the wires were no longer round due to wear, abrasion, and corrosion.\n\u00a0\nThe car side of the failure was examined in the mine the day following the accident. Approximately 575 feet of the hoist rope extended from the load termination at the brakeman car up the slope. The failed end had traveled uncontrolled down the slope after it broke. There was dirt and debris on the outer portion of the rope and there did not appear to be any lubricant present in the vicinity of the car side failure. The wires at the car side of the failure were examined and showed evidence of wear and pitting corrosion.\nMatco Services Inc. (Matco) was contracted to provide a failure examination of the hoist rope. A laboratory evaluation was conducted December 1, 2009, on the hoist side portion of the failure and the additional wires (14 pieces) recovered from the mine. The car side of the portion of the failure was photographed at Matco. A detailed examination of the wire failures on the car side portion of the rope failure was not conducted. No laboratory examination was conducted because the end of this portion of rope connected to the car traveled uncontrolled down the slope, leaving behind a considerable number of broken wires along the slope. The Matco report summary describes that the wire rope failure was due to significant wire corrosion and wear.\n\u00a0\nNONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING (NDT) & VISUAL EXAMINATIONS\nCode of Federal Regulations Title 30 requires wire ropes to be visually examined once every fourteen calendar days. If a visible condition results in a reduction of rope strength, that area of rope must be examined daily (\u00a7 75.1433(a)). Also, at least once every six months, nondestructive tests or diameter measurements are required to be performed on wire ropes (\u00a7 75.1433(c)).\n\u00a0\nWire ropes are required (\u00a7 75.1434) to be removed from service, unless damaged or deteriorated sections are cut off, when any of the following conditions occurs:\n\u00a0\n(a)Thenumberofwireswithinaropelaylength,excludingfillerwires,exceedseither\nFive percent of the total number of wires; or\nFifteen percent of the total number of wires within any strand;\n(b)amoreonewireinvalleystrandsinoneropelaylength;\n(c)Alossofmoreone-thirdoforiginaldiameterofouterwires;\n(d)Ropefromcorrosion;\n(e)Distortionofropestructure;\n(f)Heatfromanysource;\n(g)reductionduewearexceedssixpercentofdiametermeasurement;or\n(h)Lossofmorepercentofstrength\n\u00a0\nWire Rope Nondestructive Testing (NDT)\nNDT is performed by pulling the wire rope through a testing instrument or test head. NDT detects areas where flaws (broken wires, corrosion, etc.) are present in a wire rope. NDT is a relative test that compares the \u201cbest\u201d section of rope to the \u201cworst\u201d section. The loss of metallic area reported is the loss relative to the best portion of the rope and should not be interpreted as the loss of metallic area relative to a \u201cnew\u201d rope. Accordingly, the regulations require an initial or baseline measurement of a new rope (\u00a7 75.1432), and frequent subsequent tests to track the deterioration of the wire rope during its service life (\u00a7 75.1433(c)).\nThe NDT test head generates a magnetic field and detects damage and deterioration in the wire rope by measuring changes in the magnetic field. The magnetic test head is connected to an electronic device that records data electronically and prints a visual representation of collected data on a strip chart.\nThe mine operator contracted the services of Certified NDT Inc. (MSHA Contractor ID \u201cWBC\u201d) to perform NDT. The test equipment used to examine this wire rope by Certified NDT took three measurements with three sensors or channels to analyze the wire rope.\n\u00a0\nOuter and Inner Channels [aka Local Flaw (LF) Channels]\nThe first two channels are the Outer and Inner Channels. These channels detect the flaws (broken wires, corrosion, etc.) in a wire rope. Certified NDT used either the outer channel or inner channel during each test.\n\u00a0\nHall Channel [aka Loss of Metallic Area (LMA) Channel]\nThe third measurement channel is the Hall Channel and it is produced from a Hall sensor located near the center of the instrument. This channel measures the losses in the rope\u2019s cross-section caused by wear, corrosion etc. For each test, this channel is calibrated with a standardization rod of known area.\nWith the test head closed around a rope, the Inner sensor coil is located closest to the rope under test. The Hall sensor is the next closest to the rope and the Outer sensor coil is furthest away from a rope under test.\nCertified NDT performed NDT on the hoist rope on five separate occasions after the rope was installed on June 22, 2007. For each test, Certified NDT made charts showing the Inner or Outer Channel and Hall Channel. Certified NDT also gave the mine operator a one-page report for each test.\n\u00a0\nAppendix B contains charts for six tests. These tests are labeled 1 through 6. For each test, two charts, chart A and chart B were recorded. \u00a0Chart A for each test is the Inner or Outer channel, and chart B is the Hall channel. These charts were provided to MSHA by Newtown Energy, Inc., which requested the charts from Certified NDT following the accident.\nThe trace on each chart represents the data received from the test head as the wire rope travels through the test head. The data is recorded from left to right on \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the chart. The left edge of the data is the starting point of the test, and the right side represents the end of the test.\nDamaged or deteriorated areas on the wire rope can be seen on the A charts where the trace becomes wider. For example, in Appendix B, the trace locations identified as \u201csimilar indications #1, #2, and #3\u201d show areas where each trace is wider. These damaged or deteriorated areas are also called local flaws (LF).\nThe traces for the B charts move up or down when better or worse areas of the rope are detected, and should correspond to the areas where the A charts become wider or narrower. Loss of metallic area (LMA) is measured on the B charts.\nWhen the calibration information is known, accurate measurements of the high and low points (LMA) can be made.\n\u00a0\nAnalysis of Certified NDT charts\nTest 1 in Appendix B, performed on May 16, 2007, is the last test performed on the wire rope previously used on this hoist. This wire rope was retired on or about June 22, 2007. Tests 2 through 6 are the tests performed on the wire rope involved in this fatality. These tests were performed on November 5, 2007, April 11, 2008, October 1, 2008, April 3, 2009, and August, 17, 2009.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nTest number\n\n\nTest Date\n\n\nWire rope tested\n\n\n1\n\n\n5/16/2007\n\n\nPrevious wire rope\n\n\n2\n\n\n11/5/2007\n\n\nWire rope involved in fatality\n\n\n3\n\n\n4/11/2008\n\n\nWire rope involved in fatality\n\n\n4\n\n\n10/1/2008\n\n\nWire rope involved in fatality\n\n\n5\n\n\n4/3/2009\n\n\nWire rope involved in fatality\n\n\n6\n\n\n8/17/2009\n\n\nWire rope involved in fatality\n\n\u00a0\nTests 2 and 3 were the first tests performed on the new wire rope and don\u2019t indicate significant damage or deterioration. Significant and similar damage and deterioration are identified in tests 1, 4, and 5. See \u201csimilar indications #1, #2, and #3\u201d on Appendix B. These similarities show that the environmental conditions that caused deterioration to both wire ropes did not change. These environmental conditions included: water dripping onto the wire rope at the 1,180 to 1,227 foot mark in the slope, and water dripping on the wire rope at the 740 foot mark in the slope.\nTest 6, the last test performed, does not show a progression of the damage or deterioration from tests 4 and 5. Rather, it shows practically no damage or deterioration. Test 6 resembles tests 2 and 3, the first tests on the new wire rope. Even though it was obvious that the charts from test 6 did not reflect the damage and deterioration in the wire rope identified in the charts for the previous two tests, Certified NDT did not investigate the cause of this discrepancy, nor did it report this anomaly to the mine operator. Certified NDT failed to take action regarding the charts for test 6 that were obviously incorrect, inconsistent with previous tests, and showed that the condition of the wire rope improved.\n\u00a0\nAnalysis of Certified NDT written reports\nOn the five written reports of the tests performed on the rope that failed (tests 2 through 6), Certified NDT listed the following LMA measurements: 1.21%, 2.43%, 3.85%, 5.12%, and 5.79%. On the same reports, Certified NDT also listed the following estimated losses of breaking strength (LBS): 1.33%, 2.92, 4.62%, 6.14%, and 6.95%. Furthermore, on each report, the contractor stated, \u201cBased on the criteria in this regulation [30 CFR], this rope is in satisfactory condition\u201d.\nCertified NDT reported that the LMA and estimated LBS for test 6 were larger than those measured in previous tests. This finding is not substantiated by the charts that Certified NDT made following test 6. Certified NDT was negligent by providing reports to the mine operator for test 6 that where obviously inconsistent with charts for test 6.\nThe test 4 report was the first to mention damage and deterioration in the wire rope. This report states, \u201cAnomalies indicative of abrasive wear, broken internal/external wires, and fretting corrosion were depicted in this hoist rope during this inspection.\u201d These same anomalies are noted in the reports for tests 5 and 6. Additionally, the report for test 5 states, \u201cThe area of greatest wear is an area approximately 425-600 feet above the conveyance.\u201d This result was not noted in the report for test 6. The failure point of the hoist rope in the accident was approximately 575 feet from the conveyance. None of the reports indicate that the contractor made visual examinations on the worst portion of the hoist rope or that caliper measurements of the rope diameter were taken on the area of greatest wear.\nIn the report for test 1, the LMA and estimated LBS are 8.15% and 9.78%, respectively. In this report, Certified NDT stated, \u201cWe recommend re-testing this rope within 60 days, or removing it from service.\u201d It also stated that this wire rope was in satisfactory condition. Certified NDT did not report conducting a visual examination on the worst area identified by the testing.\n\u00a0\nAnalysis of Certified NDT electronic data\nAfter analyzing all the charts that Certified NDT made and the reports that Certified NDT provided to the mine operator, MSHA requested Certified NDT\u2019s electronic data for all six tests following an interview conducted on March 16, 2010. \u00a0Certified NDT provided electronic data to MSHA on or about July 8, 2010. Data was provided for only four of the six tests conducted. They included the tests on May 16, 2007, November 5, 2007 April 3, 2009 and August 17, 2009.\nCertified NDT subsequently provided the calibration data for these tests.\nAppendix C contains the charts MSHA developed from this electronic data. Certified NDT stated that the real-time strip charts generated by the test equipment during NDT are only used to ensure electronic data is being collected by the test equipment. Certified NDT stated that these strip charts are not saved after NDT, but rather are discarded. Therefore, Certified NDT uses the electronic data to make new charts and write reports. Certified NDT stated that the written reports given to the mine operator are sent about one week after NDT is completed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTest number\n\n\nTest Date\n\n\nElectronic Data Provided?\n\n\nCorresponding charts in Appendix C\n\n\n1\n\n\n5/16/2007\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNot in Appendix C\u2020\n\n\n2\n\n\n11/5/2007\n\n\nYes\n\n\n7\n\n\n3\n\n\n4/11/2008\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNA\n\n\n4\n\n\n10/1/2008\n\n\nNo\n\n\nNA\n\n\n5\n\n\n4/3/2009\n\n\nYes\n\n\n8\n\n\n6\n\n\n8/17/2009\n\n\nYes\n\n\n9\n\n\u00a0\nAs in Appendix B, the A charts in Appendix C show LF, and the B charts show LMA. \u2020For the May 16, 2007 test, the electronic data is generally consistent with the charts made by Certified NDT. For test 2, the electronic data shows a maximum LMA of 0.24% and an estimated LBS of 0.288%. For purposes of this analysis, LBS was calculated using the same method used by Certified NDT, that is, multiplying the LMA by a factor of 1.2.\nFor test 5, the electronic data provided for chart A was generally consistent with the test results provided to the mine operator. However, the electronic data for chart B was significantly different than the chart made by Certified NDT. This analysis of chart B shows a maximum LMA of at least 14.97% and estimated LBS of at least 17.96%. This estimated LBS exceeds the LBS retirement criterion of 10% (\u00a7 75.1434(h)). Unfortunately, the contractor incorrectly reported a LMA of 5.12%, an estimated LBS of 6.14%, and that the wire rope was in satisfactory condition and in compliance with 30 CFR. Certified NDT did not report to the mine operator that the electronic data showed that the wire rope exceeded the retirement criterion, and not recommending that the wire rope be immediately removed from service.\nFor test 6, the electronic data shows a maximum LMA of 3.35% and an estimated LBS of 4.02%. This data is dramatically inconsistent with the data from the previous test, which shows a maximum LMA of 14.97% and estimated LBS of 17.96%, because it suggests that the wire rope gained a substantial amount of metal. This is a physical impossibility. Certified NDT failed to address obvious inconsistencies between the electronic data from tests 5 and 6, which should have alerted Certified NDT that its analyses were significantly flawed.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nInformation given to mine operator by Certified NDT\n\n\nMSHA analysis of Certified NDT electronic data\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTest\n\n\nTest Date\n\n\nMax\n%LMA\n\n\nMax\n%LBS\n\n\nWire Rope in Compliance?\n\n\nMax\n%LMA\n\n\nMax\n%LBS\n\n\nWire Rope in Compliance?\n\n\nAppendix C Chart\n\n\n2\n\n\n11/5/2007\n\n\n1.21\n\n\n1.33\n\n\nYes\n\n\n0.24\n\n\n0.29\n\n\nYes\n\n\n7\n\n\n3\n\n\n4/11/2008\n\n\n2.43\n\n\n2.92\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNEDP\n\n\nNEDP\n\n\nNEDP\n\n\nNA\n\n\n4\n\n\n10/1/2008\n\n\n3.58\n\n\n4.62\n\n\nYes\n\n\nNEDP\n\n\nNEDP\n\n\nNEDP\n\n\nNA\n\n\n5\n\n\n4/3/2009\n\n\n5.12\n\n\n6.14\n\n\nYes\n\n\n14.97*\n\n\n17.96*\n\n\nNo\n\n\n8\n\n\n6\n\n\n8/17/2009\n\n\n5.79\n\n\n6.95\n\n\nYes\n\n\n3.35\n\n\n4.02\n\n\nYes\n\n\n9\n\nNEDP = No Electronic Data Provided\n*Values are at least this magnitude\n\u00a0\nMSHA NDT of the Wire Rope\nOn October 30, 2009, MSHA Technical Support personnel conducted NDT on the remaining portion of the rope (hoist side of the failure). NDT was conducted to determine the condition of the remaining active length of rope at the time of the accident. The testing also provided the necessary information to identify and subsequently remove any deteriorated sections of the rope, so that a new load end termination could be installed and the damaged equipment could be safely recovered from the mine.\n\u00a0\nAfter testing approximately 360 feet of hoist rope, a severely deteriorated section of rope was encountered in which external broken wires caused the test head to hang up as the broken wires became jammed in the test head. The rope was stopped momentarily and the test head moved past the damaged area of rope.\nTesting continued until about 2,430 feet of rope had been nondestructively tested. The instrumentation was moved to the hoist house and a second test was conducted by drawing the hoist rope from the spool truck back onto the hoist. The hoist rope was marked for cutoff once 1,490 feet of rope had been put back onto the drum. The test was stopped after 2,150 feet of rope was tested. At this point, the NDT indicated a LMA of 35% from the best portion of rope tested (see Appendix D). This equates to an estimated LBS of 42% (using Certified NDT\u2019s formula). This is the deteriorated area that jammed in the test head during MSHA\u2019s first NDT. The hoist rope was visually examined at this point.\nThe worst portion identified by the MSHA NDT is the dry section of rope located 14 wraps into the third layer of rope on the drum. At the worst portion of rope identified by MSHA NDT, approximately 13 feet of rope was dry and not lubricated.\nThe outer wires of the rope were worn. \u00a0Caliper measurement taken on the dry section of rope indicated diameters of 1.079, 1.084, 1.052, 1.047, and 1.066 inches. These caliper measurements were taken with the rope in an unloaded condition. Under a loaded condition (i.e. the brakeman car attached to the rope), the rope diameter measurements likely would have shown a smaller diameter.\n\u00a0\nIn the worst portion of the rope, one of the strands was visibly damaged and the strand center was exposed. This center strand had no visible lubricant and exhibited broken wires and severe pitting corrosion. The outer wires of the rope, throughout this dry area, showed visible signs of pitting corrosion. Based on the MSHA NDT evaluation, caliper measurement, and visual examination, the worst portion of the hoist rope identified by MSHA NDT exceeded the retirement criteria listed in Title 30 CFR Part 75.1434(a)(1), (a)(2), (d), (g), and (h).\nENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS\nWith the Brakeman Car parked at the bottom of the slope and the load connection on the curve, the point of rope failure occurred in the vicinity where the water was dripping at the 1,180-1,227 feet mark. The water dripping at the 740 feet mark in the slope would correspond to the worst portion of the rope (35% LMA) identified by MSHA NDT.\n\u00a0\nVISUAL EXAMINATIONS \u2013 RECORD REVIEW\nA review of the \u201cReport of Daily Inspection of Hoisting Equipment\u201d records was conducted from the date of accident to August 1, 2009. No damage to, or deterioration in, the wire rope was recorded in these record books. Also, no finding of improper lubrication was recorded in these examination books.\nThe oldest examination book had \u201cFull 8-28-09\u201d printed on the cover. The book also had the installation date of the rope documented on the cover as June 22, 2007 and three measurements: 11940 at 525 feet, 11785 at 1,167 feet, and 1190 at\n1,750 feet respectively. The numbers 11940, 11785, and 1190 are the initial caliper measurements of 1.1940, 1.1785, and 1.1900 inches respectively. The average of these three measurements produces a baseline of 1.1875 inches. The cover of this book also had \u201cRetire-1116\u201d printed on the cover. If 1.1875 inches is multiplied by 0.94, a result of 1.11625 is obtained. Title 30 CFR Part 75.1434 (g) states that unless rope damage or deterioration is removed by cutoff, wire ropes shall be removed from service when the diameter reduction due to wear exceeds six percent of the base line diameter measurement. Therefore, if caliper measurements were taken on a section of wire rope that exhibited wear to the outer wires, 1.116 inches would be an appropriate number to remove that section by cutoff, or retire the entire rope.\nThe review of the examination books indicated that the rope was cleaned on five occasions. These dates included August 3 and 31, September 14 and 28, and\nOctober 12, 2009. Each time the rope was cleaned, the task was completed on the 3rd shift by Morgan. The wire rope is cleaned to remove dirt, debris, and old lubrication. Afterward, it should be re-lubricated. No notations were made in the examination books that indicated the rope was lubricated after it was cleaned. \u00a0The examination book indicates that the last bimonthly brake test on \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the brakeman car was conducted by Boggs on September 21, 2009. No notations were made in the examination book that indicated any adjustments to the brakes were made. The final NDT conducted by Certified NDT on August 17, 2009, was not documented in the examination book. \u00a0On the day of the accident, the examination book indicated that the daily visual examination was conducted by Morgan at 4:30 a.m., several hours before sunrise.\n\u00a0\nVISUAL EXAMINATIONS OF THE HOIST WIRE ROPE\nRope examinations were conducted daily by Morgan. These examinations did not detect obvious and significant damage to, and deterioration in, the wire rope. Also, the examinations did not detect significant areas of improper lubrication.\nThe rope was examined on the surface between the collar of the slope and the sheave wheel. The rope was examined while the conveyance was lowered into the slope at approximately 200 feet per minute (fpm). With the examination being conducted at this fixed location, stress locations could not be properly examined where the rope leaves the drum, at drum crossovers, and at change-of\u2013 layer regions. An adequate examination for structural damage, corrosion, and improper lubrication could not be properly conducted while the rope was traveling at 200 fpm.\n\u00a0\nGuide rollers were installed on the mine floor and coal rib at approximately 20 foot intervals for the wire rope to roll on to prevent wear from dragging along the mine floor and coal rib. Eighteen of these rollers (approximately 20%) were either frozen, missing, or had the cable guides missing. These conditions were causing excessive wear and damage to the rope.\nThe damage to the rollers appeared to have occurred over a period of at least several weeks. Pre-shift examinations were conducted in the slope 3 times a day by numerous examiners. The damaged rollers were obvious and the damaged rollers were not reported to management. No notations relating to damaged or worn rollers were recorded in the Pre-shift Mine Examiner\u2019s Report.\n\u00a0\nTRAINING\n30 CFR does not require any training that would instruct wire rope examiners on the proper procedures to examine wire ropes.\n\u00a0\nRon Petty, President of Certified NDT, performed all tests on the wire rope. He has been performing NDT since 1989, and has been performing about 200 tests a year at both mine and non-mine facilities. Petty has certifications and qualifications in ultrasonic, magnetic particle, electromagnetic methods, visual, and penetrant forms of NDT. The NDT equipment Petty used on this wire rope was a Meraster MD120 supplied by a company in Poland, Zawada NDT. Mr. Petty spent several weeks in Poland receiving training on how to use this NDT equipment.\n\u00a0\nOTHER CERTIFIED NDT OBSERVATIONS\nOn each report, Certified NDT incorrectly stated the cross sectional area for a new wire rope is 0.482 in2. The rope manufacturer states that the cross sectional area is 0.637 in2.\nThe calibration information listed by Certified NDT on the reports given to the mine operator is significantly different than the calibration shown on the electronic data that Certified NDT provided to MSHA. The reports all show a calibration voltage of 0.47 mV, but the electronic data show calibration voltages for tests 2, 5, and 6 were 3.5 mV, 0.2 mV, and 0.2 to 0.3 mV respectively.\nCertified NDT used a test head that has a distance wheel; however, the distance wheel was not used for any testing dating back to May 2007.\nCertified NDT provided its \u201cElectromagnetic Wire Rope Examination Procedure\u201d following MSHA\u2019s second request for information. The procedures are dated November 1992, but state that they use the guidelines and recommendations in the 1993 edition of the American Society of Test Materials (ASTM) E1571 standard. The Examination Procedure also states that ASTM E1571 1993 \u201cshall be considered as part of this procedure.\u201d ASTM E1571 1993 did not exist in November 1992 because it was issued 10 months later on September 15, 1993. The Table of Contents for Certified NDT\u2019s \u201cElectromagnetic Wire Rope Examination Procedure\u201d lists seven sections. Sections 3.0 Examination Standardization, 4.0 Equipment, and 5.0 Time of Inspection, are not in the document even though they are listed in the Table of Contents. \u00a0Sections 6.0 Personnel and 7.0 Records are provided, however, all of Section 7.0 is numbered as if it is in Section 9.0, a Section that does not exist. Section 8.0, \u201cCalibration Procedures,\u201d was provided as the last page of the document. The calibration procedures provided address records and laboratory calibration with steel rod reference standards, and does not address the critical field calibration of a wire rope.\nASTM E1571 1993 states, \u201cIt is the responsibility of the user of this standard to establish appropriate safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to use.\u201d During an interview, Petty stated that he visually examines the wire rope: (1) in areas where NDT indicates strength losses close to 10%, (2) if he sees an abrupt change in the traces for LMA and/or LF, or\n(3) if there are dramatic differences from the previous test. Tests 5 and 6 met these criteria but Petty did not visually examine the wire rope. The manufacturer of Petty\u2019s NDT instrumentation recommends periodic visual inspection of ropes and that one should be able to observe and successively see the increasing broken wires and other defects in the wire rope from test to test.\n\u00a0", "\n\u00a0\nCertified NDT stated that the Outer Channel of the instrumentation was consistent with MSHA\u2019s instrument Local Flaw (LF) Channel. The instrument manufacturer and owner of the company, Mr. Kazimierz Zawada, was contacted and reported that the Outer Channel is designed to only be used with the Inner Channel to estimate the depth of a defect in a rope cross section.\n\u00a0\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS\n\u00a0\nAn analysis was conducted to identify the most basic causes of the accident that were corrected through reasonable management controls. The following root causes were identified.\nRoot Cause: Certified NDT did not report the true condition of the wire rope and did not follow prudent examination practices. Rather, Certified NDT reported that the wire rope complied with 30 CFR, even though the test data showed that the wire rope met the retirement criteria in 30 CFR. Newtown Energy did not provide adequate oversight of the NDT performed by Certified NDT.\nCorrective Actions: Certified NDT revised its written wire rope examination procedures. These written procedures now list proper field standardization of test equipment, appropriate conditions that necessitate a visual inspection of the wire rope, when rope diameter measurements will conducted, and a requirement to protect strip charts from deterioration, as well as retain strip charts until the wire rope is retired. The revised written procedures also state that the testing of the rope will comply with the current version of ASTM E1571 \u201cStandard Practice for Electromagnetic Examination of Ferromagnetic Wire Rope\u201d.\nFurthermore, for two years after MSHA\u2019s report is released, Certified NDT will notify MSHA at least 7 calendar days prior to each non-destructive testing it performs on a wire rope at a mine site, in order to allow MSHA to monitor and evaluate any such testing.\nNewtown Energy developed written procedures to review the NDT test results they receive from NDT contractors. Newtown Energy trained miners in these new procedures. Newtown Energy has contracted the services of Rotesco Inc. to perform future NDT on the hoist wire rope.\nRoot Cause: The mine operator did not have an effective program to properly conduct visual examinations for structural damage, corrosion, improper lubrication, wear and broken wires at stress points were not performed. The examinations conducted failed to detect obvious and significant damage, deterioration, and improper lubrication.\nCorrective Actions: Newtown Energy developed written visual examination procedures. The procedures require the examiner who performs the 14 day examination to examine the hoist wire rope at an inspection speed no greater than 50 feet per minute, and to examine the rope in a well-lighted area. The procedures require the examiner to comply with the provisions of 30 CFR 75.1433(a) and (d). The procedures require the examiner to record that the examination was conducted, as well as any of the conditions described in 30 CFR 75.1433(a), in a record book titled \u201c14 Day Wire Rope Exam.\u201d Mine management reinstructed examiners on proper wire rope examinations.\nNewtown Energy also developed written hoist wire rope safety precautions. These precautions require the following. Baseline measurements will be taken with an electronic caliper on three hundred foot increments for new wire ropes. The baseline measurements will be performed after the rope has stretched but before wear begins, and will always be taken within three weeks after installation. The baseline measurements will be recorded in a hoist book. The first NDT will be performed within one month after the installation of a new wire rope, and will be performed a least once every six months thereafter. In addition to the 14-day wire rope examination, a visual examination of the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0normally used portion of the wire rope will be performed every day the slope hoist is operated and recorded in the hoist book. This visual examination will be performed by dropping the hoist car to the bottom at a speed no greater than 100 feet per minute. The rope will be examined near the sheave wheel outside where the examiner can see the top and bottom side of the rope.\nRoot Cause: The mine operator did not have an effective policy to ensure that miners did not ride on a conveyance whose weight exceeded the braking capacity of the brakeman car.\nCorrective Actions: Newtown Energy developed a written policy regarding personnel and supply conveyances. The policy prohibits anyone from riding the brakeman car when the conveyance is used to drop or pull supplies or equipment, or when the brakeman car is attached to any other car. The policy also requires at least one person to be in the seat that has access to the emergency stop switch when personnel are being hoisted up or down the slope. The policy states that this person must be trained in the use of the emergency stop switch.\nNewtown Energy trained miners in this new policy.\nRoot Cause: The mine operator did not have an effective policy, procedure, or program to ensure that miners remain in safe locations at the bottom of the slope when men and material were being hoisted into and out of the mine.Corrective Actions: Newtown Energy established a new waiting area at the bottom of the slope where miners could position themselves when the hoist was inoperation. Newtown Energy instructed the miners where to position themselves when the hoist was in operation.\nAdditionally, Newtown Energy developed new written procedures regarding personnel and supply conveyances. The procedures require that personnel enter or exit the brakeman car only after it has come to a complete stop. Also, the procedures prohibit personnel from being in the track slope or track bottom when the conveyance is being hoisted. Approaches to the bottom track area will be clearly marked with signs and visible warning lights, and the slope is equipped with flashing warning lights as the conveyance is in movement. A one minute delay with alarms will be implemented to allow personnel to have time to move to safety. When the conveyance is not in use it will be parked on the surface with the switch thrown in the direction of the yard.\n": "\u00a0\u00a0", "\nCONCLUSION\nThe accident occurred when the slope hoist rope broke resulting in a runaway of the brakeman car, mine locomotive and loaded rail car down a 16 degree, 1,750 foot slope. The victim was at the bottom of the slope when he was struck by the conveyance. Certif ied NDT did not report that the wire rope exceeded the retirement criterion of 10% loss of strength. The mine operator did not perform adequate wire rope examinations for structural damage, corrosion, improper lubrication, wear and broken wires at stress points. \u00a0Also, the mine operator did not have an effective policy to prevent miners from riding a conveyance whose weight exceeded the braking capacity of the brakeman car. Furthermore, the operator did not have an effective program to ensure miners were positioned in safe locations when near the slope bottom while a conveyance is being hoisted.\n\u00a0\nApproved By:\nRobert G.
